I would now like to turn the conference over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon :  Good morning, and thanks to everyone for joining us today in our call. I'm pleased to take you through our Q1 results in the strong momentum we're building in our business. In today's review of our Q1 2014, results I'll be referring to growth rates in the quarter, and let's otherwise noted these growth rates refer to Q1 2014, performance compared to Q1 2013 performance.  In terms of key things you could take away from today's review, we continue to accelerate our revenue growth driven by global expansion of our CAG franchise.  Organic revenue growth was 8% in Q1, at the high end of our expectations driven by 10.4% growth in global CAG Diagnostic Referring, normalized or changes in distributor inventory levels. Our focus on innovation and clear benefits from our investments in our commercial capability globally is driving very strong instrument placements. Worldwide Catalyst and Haematology placements increased 36% and 22% respectively year-on-year in Q1, and we sold over 1200 SNAP pros in the quarter, positioning us well for strong continued CAG annuity growth. Our results reflect solid growth across regions as we continue to expand our international presence. Overall our international revenues increased 13% in Q1, including a 1% benefit from acquisitions. Growth was driven by 13% organic gains in CAG recurring diagnostic revenues and solid growth in our LPD business. Finally we're delivering solid profit results reflected in our Q1 EPS growth of 10% to $0.89 per share. This performance is on track with our full year goals as we support investment towards our long term growth potential. Based on our solid start to the year and the growth trends we've established in our recurring revenue streams, we\u2019re increasing our full year outlook for organic revenue growth for 2014, to 8% to 9%, versus our prior guidance of 7% to 8%.  As a reminder this is effective and 8.5% to 9.5% organic growth rate when adjusted for estimated deferred revenue impact associated with the Catalyst 1 launch. I'll walk through that like in more detail later in the call. Let me begin by breaking down our quarterly performance starting by an overview of growth by region. We continue to post strong growth across our major regions supported by strong momentum in our CAG business. As noted our international expansion continues on a strong track reflecting a 13% revenue growth in Q1 to $153 million, or 42% of overall revenues. This momentum was supported by strong growth in our CAG business across regions. We drove 14% organic growth in Europe CAG this quarter, supported by double digit gains in recurring diagnostic revenues across all three modalities. We drove strong reference lab growth in Germany and other key markets served by our Life Sick Facility as well as U.K. Favourable weather in these markets reinforced strong business execution. We also benefited from extra momentum we're building in our organic business through our go-direct strategy. Our Asia CAG revenues grew 28% organically in Q1, reflecting strong growth across the region. Instrument placements were up significantly across Europe and Asia compared to a softer start in Q1 of 2013. In the U.S we also posted solid gains in the quarter. Q1 revenues were $208 million, reflecting 6% organic growth. U.S. results were driven by CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains of 8%, normalized for distributor inventory changes. Note that Q1 revenues excluded $2 million of deferred revenues associated with the Catalyst 1 introductory offer. This solid performance was achieved against the soft market backdrop impacted by unfavourable weather conditions. These effects can be seen in results of the over 4000 veterinary practises we track through our clinical level data. For the first quarter in the U.S. patient visits were down 1.2% versus Q1 2013, and practise revenues were up 2.1%. this compares to the relatively steady growth of 2.1% in patient visits and 5.5% in practise revenue growth we saw for the full year in 2013.  Our analysis of regional date shows that practise level growth was clearly impacted by unusually harsh winter weather in the East Coast, Mid West and South East. Based on this regional data we feel that Q1 practise, there's a decline is transitory and doesn\u2019t reflect longer term transfer growth and pet health care spending. We continue to plan for moderate overall market growth at the veterinary practise level for the balance of this year. Our solid global revenue performance was driven by 9% organic growth in our Companion Animal Group. We're positioning ourselves for strong continued growth through excellent placement and instrument placements. Worldwide Catalyst Placements grew 36% year-over-year, with double digit growth in all major regions. While the high growth rate was held in part by a relatively easier comparison to the prior year Q1, we're up to a very strong start with the Catalyst 1 introductory offer placements in the U.S. and we continue to drive strong momentum across our chemistry platform in international. We achieved the strong results while also maintaining a very high quality of placements on a global basis with over 50% going to customers new to IDEXX. As expected the improved economics and footprint of the Catalyst 1 is broadening access to Catalyst Technology as evident by our strong penetration in Greenfield and competitive accounts as well as the accounts operating from Vet Tests.  Given the substantial uplift we've seen in Diagnostic Testing after catalyst is placed, we believe this will support accelerated recurring IDEXX consumable growth. Worldwide haematology placements also grew robustly in Q1. Overall placements were up 22% year-on-year, with strong growth across all regions.  We continue to be pleased with our success in placing ProCyte Dx into accounts new to IDEXX and saw this metric increase to 50% in Q1, our best performance on record. Consistent with our expectations we are seeing some shift in haematology placements towards LaserCyte Dx, specially when we're sung a full instrument suite with callus 1. This is logical as the price point of LaserCyte Dx is an excellent match to callus-1, while still offering us a purer menu compared to any competitive haematology analyser. Strong placements drove 16% organic growth in global instrument revenue in the quarter to nearly $19 million. Instrument revenues included benefits from the sale of over 1200 snap core units which Jon will speak to more in his comments. As noted we estimated that the deferred revenue associated with our Catalyst 1intrudoctury offer was about $2 million in the quarter.  As expected our instrument revenue growth is below our placement growth reflecting the relatively lower price point in Catalyst 1, as well as mix impacts associated with higher international sales of lower cost analysers. These effects have limited economic impact as margins are similar across our product line and instrument margin is a less significant driver of our financial performance. The key driver of our financial performance CAG recurring diagnostic revenues for revenues associated with instrument consumables and service, rapid acid test kits and lab services were $259 million in the first quarter, representing about 72% of overall revenues.  With highly durable annuity grew 10.4% organically year-on-year in Q1, normalized for changes in distributor inventory levels. As noted these results were supported by strong gains across regions with overall growth straining at the high end of our full year goal of 9% to 11%.  Changes in distributor inventories, the reported growth in recurring CAG diagnostic revenues by about 2% in the quarter. As U.S. distributor inventories finished at 3.4 weeks at the end of Q1, down from over 4 weeks at year end, a decline that didn't occur in Q1, 2013. Prime Modality instrument consumable revenues of $84 million in Q1 grew organically 12% versus the prior year period or 15% or normalized for changes in distributor inventory levels. Growth continues to be driven by a number of factors, including our steadily growing installed base that comes from customers due to IDEXX,, increased testing as current IDEXX customers upgrade their in-house labs with Catalyst ProCyte enhance loyalty from our customer base. Note that catalyst customers now account for nearly 90% of U.S chemistry consumable revenue exclusive of corporate accounts with the remaining 10% coming from Vet test customers.  Revenues for our rapid asset kit component of the CAG recurring diagnostic revenue, which excludes SNAP Pro device revenue were $43 million in Q1. These revenues increased 3% normalized for changes in distributor inventory levels, in part reflecting pressure from the U.S weather impact.  We expect benefits from the strong launch of SNAP Pro will support solid continued growth in the rapid assay modality. A reference lab consulting services modality grew 10% organically to $118 million in Q1. We saw strong growth in all of our regions around the world. In North America the diagnostic sales force model and utilization of VetConnect PLUS has helped to generate an increased in the level of diagnostics being run by our customers while also improving on our already strong customer attention rates. As noted our international regions also delivered strong volume growth added by well executed issues such as our new Life Sick IDEXX Direct Reference Lab, and our go-direct strategy in the Nordics. Our Practice Management and Digital Imagining Systems business with revenues of $24 million in Q1 grew organically by 13%. We benefited from our base of pet health network Pro customers, largely than typical practice management installations and growth in the service components of both the practise management and digital imaging businesses tied to our loyal install base. Our Livestock Poultry and Dairy business also grew solid in Q1, up 5% originally.  Overall revenues adjusted for foreign exchange grew 10% to 431 million, reflecting benefits from our acquisition of our Brazil distributor last fall. Solid organic growth was supported by continued expansion of our dairy business in China and progress in expanding our LPD business in Eastern Europe. Results were better than expected in the quarter due to a relatively slower than expected ramp down in bovine programs in Western Europe. As noted in our last call changes in disease eradication programs get to add to volatility in this business. We expect these impacts will contribute to moderate organic revenue declines in our LPD for the balance of the year. Our water business grew 4% in Q1, to $21 million, including benefits from the acquisition of our South Africa distributor. Organic growth was 2%, reflecting gains in our America's and Asia Pacific regions, offset by some tougher year-on-year comparisons in Europe in Q1. Business growth continues to be driven by our Core Colilert Franchise as we build an increasing contribution from newer products. We took benefits from our new products will keep us on track for mid-single digit growth gaol this year. Solid revenue gains across or business helped to drive continued strong profit in cash flow performance. While profit in Q1 increased 10% year-on-year supported by a 70 basis point year-over-year improvement in gross margin to 56%. Gross margin benefit from product cost efficiencies; moderate price gains and a reduction in royalty expense for one our products that also included a non-recurring benefit of about $1 million. This was offset a bit by some unfavourable product mix from higher proportion instrument sales. Operating expenses were 37% of revenue in Q1, down slightly from last year as a percentage of revenue. As mentioned upfront, Q1 of 2013 included a $4 million charge to G&A related to the bankruptcy of the vendor. Adjusting for that operating expense as a percent of revenue increased 90 basis points. This increase is primarily driven by the investments we are making worldwide in sales and marketing that's helping to driver accelerated revenue growth. Strong revenue growth supported margins that were in line with expectations. We need to deliver a fully diluted EPS of $0.89 per share. EPS growth was 10% and currency changes had no material impact. Our effective tax rate at 31.2% was as expected as does not include any benefit for the R&D tax credit for 2014 as it has expired and hasn\u2019t been renewed. As a reminder in regards to the R&D tax credit, Q1 of last year included both an adjustment for all of 2012 plus the normal credit for the 2013 quarter. Adjusting Q1 of 2013 to exclude the R&D tax credit recorded in the quarter and reserve associated with the vendor bankruptcy, EPS grew 12%.  Free cash flow was $29 million or 62% of net income in Q1. Free cash flow for the quarter was as expected reflecting the typical timing that we see in Q1 related to things like bonus payments and accounts receivable and inventory increases in advance of the heartworm [ph] ruined season. We remain on track towards our full year outlook for free cash flow in the range of 95% to 100% of net income. Our strong cash flow enabled, continues to support our share repurchases in Q1. We repurchased 507600 shares for about $70 million during the quarter.  Turning to our outlook given our strong start to the year, we're increasing our full year revenue guidance. We now expect full year 2014 revenues to be in the range of $1.495 billion to $1.51 billion. This reflects an expectation for full year organic growth in the range of 8% to 9%. The increase in our outlook reflects current trends towards the higher end of our full year goals of 9% to 11% growth in CAG recurring diagnostic revenues as well as upsides from stronger than expected LPD performance in Q1. Our outlook intends to assume an excepted $5 million to $10 million of deferred revenue associated with a Catalyst 1 introductory offer. Adjusting for the impact of this revenue deferral, organic growth will be about 8.5% to 9.5% in 2014.  We remain on track towards delivery of our full year goal of $3.76 to $3.86 EPS, or adjusted growth of 11% to 14%. This reflects expectations for relatively consistent operating margins for the full year compared to 2013. We intend to leverage upsides from our improved revenue outlook just for increased investment towards key long term growth initiatives which Jon will speak to in his comments. For Q2 we'd highlight that we expect organic growth consistent with our full year outlook of 89%. We also expect operating margins will be about 100 basis points below year levels in Q2, reflecting increased commercial investments and impacts from targeted organizational changes in our European organization aligned with our growth strategy.  With that I'll turn it over to Jon. Jon Ayers :  Okay, thank you, Brian. As Brian elucidated we have strong performance in the quarter. In revenues, earnings and the key metrics such as instrument placements and the percent that go to accounts that are either competitive or new to IDEXX and thus expand our install base. All these indicate, I think the health of the business I and the sustainability of our model for growing our markets. This growth and success were in virtually all regions of the world. The result of our Companion Animal Group in North America reflected the success of our sales transformation completed in Q3 of last year. This is the second full quarter of strong performance since having come through the learning period.  Validating the new sales model, the key metrics are consistent with Q4 2013, for Veterinary Diagnostic Consults and 98% territory occupancy rate and a 60% increase in number of in-person customer visits over Q1 of 2013, the last quarter we were still fully in the old sales model.  Customer acquisition for tension and utilization were also strong. Our new compensation plan implemented this Q1, that in part were work professionals for growing or recurring diagnostic revenue in their territory as well as instrument placements was also a great success. We believe we have now created a strong foundation for a North America CAG sales and marketing organization that we can readily scale as our revenues grow. Internationally we also had strong performance in all of our major country markets. In many markets where we have a direct sales organization we're able to make investments that generate sustained revenue growth through instrument placements, new lab business and growth in veterinary practice usage of our diagnostics. For illustration purposes let me give you some Q1 year-over-year organic growth of our CAG business in some selected country markets. We had over 30% organic growth in the Nordics, Austria, South Africa, Australia and China. We had over 20% in Japan and in Germany, Holland and Switzerland it 15% to 20% organic growth. In fact CAG International Organic growth was 15% overall. These growth numbers are a result of a strategy augmenting international and in-country leadership, supported by augmented structure and of course the global rule out of our innovative diagnostic offerings. This growth also shows that pet owners everywhere have a strong bond with their pets and are willing consumers of veterinary healthcare when they understand the benefits of their beloved animals. Speaking advances in our diagnostic offering, our announcement this past January of our newest in-house chemistry platform, Catalyst 1 was a significant success as measured by the success of our introductory offer for this instrument, where customers buy Catalyst 1, and are known to Catalyst Dx until that unit is available. In this way customers immediately see the benefits of the pick up and testing the catalyst enables and of course add to our instrument consumable revenue growth. The Catalyst 1 price point, it's practise is that run as few as one sample a day which is pretty low considering a single doc practice maybe seeing 13 to 15 patients a day, really should be more than one sample, but that's kind of where the industry is. So we're seeing the Catalyst 1 is the right instrument with the right footprint and the right price point for the vast majority of practices that don't already enjoy the benefit of catalyst technology with the Catalyst Dx and we continue to see strong growth and enhanced testing when customers upgrade the catalyst and a haematology offering for their in-house testing. This both in utilization does not generally come at the expense of our reference lab testing, showing that testing begets testing. Our in-house instruments and their unique ability to allow customers generate results easily during the client visit, something we call real time care, expands the market for diagnostic testing. We are also very pleased with the launch of SNAP Pro mobile device in March. With sales of over 1200 units we're able to validate the instrument performs extremely well in the practice environment and provides tremendous value to our customers with rapid assay test kits like significantly improving work flow and staff efficiency. While at the same time automatically instantly adding their results to the patient's diagnostic history with Vetconnect PLUS. We expect to build upon this installed base of customers throughout the year from our very large base of North American customers who regularly use our SNAP Rapid test kits. We expect that the value that SNAP Pro provides our customers are the SNAP family test kits will reinforce their loyalty to IDEXX at the in-house Test Kit modality and feed all of IDEXX Diagnostics. Turning to our strategy of advancing diagnostic insight and value to information technology, we continue to redefine diagnostics through our club VetConnect PLUS, which changes the focus as the patient's results from what does one sample tell us to how does the most recent result fit into the patient's evolution and metrics over time, thus providing greater medical insight. We continue to grow the number of customer activation which now stands at over 13,300 and have launched the service in Australia in late March, adding to the U.S, Canada, and U.K launches previously. An addition we continue to add functionality, including a mobile app version for I-phones and I-pads that notifies customers when new results are ready and shows these results.  As I mentioned the customers who adopt that Connect PLUS increase their loyalty to IDEXX Diagnostics because of the unique value they can only receive when they use our ecosystem, including the results from our in-house labs, SNAP Pro and our reference lab services. As a result of the combination of our new customer-centric sales model in North America and VetConnect PLUS option ,we can continue to see steadily increasing customer loyalty levels across our three diagnostic modalities , even as they today stand at what I would consider world class of 96% to almost 99% depending on the modality. Our increase in organic revenue growth guidance today for 2014 of 8% to 9% that Brian mentioned reflects our confidence in the success we are seeing in our global markets and the sustained growth of the enduring recurring revenue of our three diagnostic modalities, reference labs, in-house instrument consumables, rapid assay test kits, supported now with launch of SNAP Pro. The advances of our diagnostic technology offering over the past few years which we have discussed regularly and in detail in this call provides for an offering that is quite unique and differentiate on key dimensions, importance of the veterinary and their staff. Notably our diagnostic ecosystem works in a seamless way to help veterinarians advance the standard of medical care and strengthen the bonds they have with pet owners. This accelerates the growth of their business and thus in turn our recurring revenue. With this success we have decided to invest in incremental margin that comes from this revenue acceleration in 2014 in further resources that will both assure we achieve revenue in 2014 and propel IDEXX growth in years to come. Specifically we expect to increase the number of field sales, service, marketing and customer education resources in the North American market, scaling our now proven sales model. Scaling is far easier a task then the one we undertook last year to transform that sales model. Second, we expect to do the same key international markets where we believe we can augment demand for diagnostic offerings. Third, we'll be adding international regional and country leadership to support markets where we're are direct, including those markets where we've recently chosen to go direct. Fourth, we'll be adding international infrastructure to support long term growth in these markets. Note, as we are excited as we are today about the potential for growth in North America, we believe the growth opportunity internationally is even bigger. And finally we'll be augmenting our investment in cloud based IP solutions, including the continued global role out of VetConnect PLUS and the expansion of its capability along several dimensions. So in conclusion, our goal over time is to build the momentum on our business to sustain double digit organic revenue growth. We very much believe this is achievable given the strong bonds between pets and owners globally and the medical value of the diagnostic category, not to mention the state of our innovative diagnostic and IT ecosystem. Yet we have to apply augmented commercial resources around the world to bring this to our customers and this goal to fruition. We think this investment will provide an outstanding return and create significant incremental shareholder value. So with those comments Cynthia, I will turn the call over to Q&A. Operator :  (Operator Instructions) we will go to the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Please go ahead. Ryan Daniels - William Blair : Good morning guys, thanks for taking my questions. I guess Jon the first one for you on the sales force, given the transformation and the changing compensation. I'm curios if you can offer any color on, perhaps any surprises you've seen. Meaning are you seeing customer show proclivity to be more receptive to you know growth in one modality versus another or your seeing, cross on some opportunities to gain share using your in the point of care versus reference lab, just on anything there that's [indiscernible] Jon Ayers : Sure, well of course you know we do believe we have a significant cost selling opportunity. I remind investors that if you look at our customers for in-house chemistry and our customers for the reference lab, there's only actually 40% overlap. So it's a very-very significant cost selling opportunity and we thought that was one of the key reasons for the transformation and a single point and contact with customers and of course we're able to better achieve that with a 60% growth in the number of visits.  I would say you know the one thing that is continually reinforced to us is the value of real time care. As you know Ryan, our offering and it's ability to generate results in eight minutes easily, full comprehensive chemistry and a hematology profile, [indiscernible] will be added with Catalyst 1 and Catalyst Dx in coming quarters. That customers are now more and more realizing that they get greater compliance when they have the results in front of them and they're able to speak face to face in the moment, in context with the pet owner and greater compliance not only to you know whatever the treatment plan may be, but it's also greater compliance as any suggested follow-on testing which may go to reference lab. Which is why we say testing begets testing. So we believe and I think if you look at the kind of the general trend, we're seeing a growth in the in-house modality which is growing overall, a diagnostics modality that we are driving because of real time care and more and more customers are, you know I speak to customers at conferences, they readily say [ph] I just, you know really working for us. And our reps are very-very good at bringing that insight to customers, now that they are really representing the customer in all of our diagnostic modalities. Ryan Daniels - William Blair : Okay very helpful and then it\u2019s my follow-up. Jon, I now you choose your words carefully and I think a minute ago you just mentioned inability to sustain double-digit organic growth. So, you think about your growth blueprint. I know you are not far from that in your guidance this year but as that a few years out it\u2019s kind of a three- to five-year goal. Is there any more color that are pretty important change in tone?some of the payers try to maybe ease up a little bit on some of the restrictions here and can just be a tailwinds. For U.S. we think about the balance in 2014 relative to 2013. Jon Ayers :  Well. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re putting a time frame on that goal. Our organic growth goal this year is 8% to 9%. Obviously, we\u2019re higher organic growth in the Companion Animal business, which I believe is on the order of 85% of our revenues. Our overall organic growth for the company is brought down a little bit by the other 15% of the revenues that are generally just a little bit lower organic growth and of course we\u2019ve had the LPD, which has been actually had a good quarter but generally flat is slightly down as we worked through some of these eradication programs, but we are seeing the trajectory to acceleration and our goal is to accelerate at organic growth to the double digit level and at 8% to 9% we are not that far away from it. Ryan Daniels - William Blair :  Right. Okay, thanks guys. Nice talking to you. Operator : Thank you. Next we go to line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James & Associates: Hi guys. Thinking about the international expense you\u2019re kind of announcing right now, what change  to you maybe 6 months ago, 12 months ago surrounding your expectations to bigger investment? Here I\u2019m wondering what happened this quarter that make you comfortable enough to make the switch? Jon Ayers :  I think a number of things that came together. We have really good \u2013 we put in some excellent leadership with Michael Williams and we got really strong country management leadership. That combined with the fact that our modalities and our offerings are improving, as Brian mentioned the [indiscernible]extract with the [indiscernible]is really starting to penetrate the continental European market. Obviously, we have the prospects of Catalyst One. If we think Catalyst One is the excessive product in North America, our European guys said \u201cwell, we thought developed Catalyst One for us because it\u2019s so perfect\u201d and [indiscernible] for our markets. And of course that will be a 2015 opportunity as we rolled out that out. And then of course we\u2019re rolling out the diagnostic IT ecosystem with VetConnect PLUS. So, we just see the confluence of both and the markets are responding. I wouldn\u2019t say Europe is doing particularly well economy-wise although did have a weather quarter than the U.S. did. But look at the growth we\u2019re achieving but not only in Europe. Look at the growth we\u2019re achieving in Asia and we just of course went direct in Brazil with the acquisition of one of our distributors at Madasa. So, we just the opportunity there. We\u2019re seeing a [indiscernible]. We have the confidence, we have the leadership, we have the portfolio and so we take a time to accelerate that investment . Like I just said when you had good leadership it tends to identify more opportunities and the momentum build on itself and I think it\u2019s reinforcing whatever business we have globally and we\u2019re seeing more opportunity and we want to invest behind that because we think it\u2019s going to be aid to our accelerated growth trend and will be a great return for us. Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James & Associates:  Right . And then maybe on the Noble Pro , the 1200 sign-ups that you had so far in the first quarter, but can you give a [indiscernible] 3:41 flavour in terms of other existing customers on SNAP [indiscernible] about the characteristics of the customers you had thus far. Jon Ayers :  Yeah those are - though of course the target not be existing customers of SNAP because the vast majority of the North American Veterinary practices are customers of our SNAP. Line is fairly [indiscernible]. I\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019re seeing is they really appreciate, they basically load and walk away. I think SNAP, it\u2019s a very \u2013 that the workflow is just very, very beneficial for practices that are busy and they neither text every second. [indiscernible] like to think kind of benefit in workloads we brought with the in-house instruments on Catalyst and laser side and pro side on the hematology side, now the big improvement in workflow for the test kit modality in general. In fact, what we are seeing is the average practice. The average practice is buying two, not just one but two because they need them for all kind of volumes. So obviously that\u2019s a mix. Some practices are buying more and another practices are buying one. But we\u2019re just seeing really, really positive customer response. Obviously, we\u2019re very early but it\u2019s nice to see those. That\u2019s 1200 is [indiscernible] the feedback from the customers has just been universally very, very excited. Operator :  Thank you. And as a reminder if you have any questions or comments you may press * and then 1. And we\u2019ll go to the line of Kevin Alex [ph] with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Kevin Alex - Piper Jaffray & Co.:  Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First off, you\u2019ve mentioned weather a couple of times and also in U.S. it seems like seasonality. We\u2019re getting off to [indiscernible] and hard warm season. What sort of impact do you think that had on testing and I think you mentioned the patient visits were off 1.2% in Q1. Have you seen any sort of improvement since then? Jon Ayers :  Yeah. Thank you for the question . Just give you a little context. That\u2019s a pretty big drop as we look at what patient visits will do quarter before or last five or six years, even during the great recession. 1.2% a decline \u2013 this is a fairly robust market. So, we don\u2019t see that. We only see it \u2013 I only like to see like one or two other quarters in the last five or six years and clearly it was regional as we\u2019re looking the regional thing. With 1000 practices you can get some fairly good granularity on originality of that. So, that just gives us some indication. I don\u2019t think in diagnostic testing that in general you may get lot, although those visits are lots. I don\u2019t know about other categories. I can only speak about our category. And so we expect there to be good demand. We think that decline is transitory. The 2% we saw in patient visits and the 5.5% in revenue growth with the clinical level for tech care services with our base of 4000 customers we saw on 2013 we think it\u2019s more the sustainable rate, but I don\u2019t think beyond that we\u2019ll make up any of the loss on the diagnostic category in the second quarter. Kevin Alex - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. And what the informatics you have, did you notice any kind of delay or drop in diagnostic testing especially in the South as I think hardware season got off to a late start? Jon Ayers : Brian mentioned that rapid assay was a little bit a down again. We think that\u2019s kind of a weather transitory issue and a chunk of our rapid assay testing is parasitic disease which includes hardware testing and the purpose there is obviously you want to test before you put them on a preventative, kind of a co-indicator if you will. I guess it\u2019s the only thing I would say on that. Kevin Alex - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Yeah. Hardware [indiscernible] I would say that bigger impact as Jon highlighted was kind of a consistent weather impact in the year that you would expect see it just given the unusual conditions this winter. So, I think this was definitely more of a transitory planning and we would anticipate getting back to [indiscernible] that you saw last year. Jon Ayers :  Yeah . Good point. My people really came at the transitory impact on the patient visit day [indiscernible] that were reporting obviously were very, very pleased with our performance. And I\u2019m not going to put weather it\u2019s \u2013 I think it was very strong performance for the quarter when you [indiscernible] everything in and I\u2019m not thinking any weather component there. Kevin Alex - Piper Jaffray & Co.: My second question is one Catalyst One. On your prepared comments you mentioned that it\u2019s the right product because [indiscernible] don\u2019t use Catalyst now. Can you give us an idea of how big that [indiscernible] market is and what sort of penetration we should expect overtime? Jon Ayers :  Well customers who don\u2019t use Catalyst today they use it by-product back to 50%. So, it\u2019s a ____ addressable market and that is it\u2019s the U.S. or North America number and that doesn\u2019t even include international. Obviously, we have very, very Catalyst Dx placement performance international. We don\u2019t have any introductory offer for Catalyst One international. We haven\u2019t really brought Catalyst One outside North America. So, that addressable market is even bigger, far bigger. Kevin Alex - Piper Jaffray & Co.:  Okay. Jon Ayers :  Generally speaking, practices are smaller outside North America than they are in North America. Kevin Alex - Piper Jaffray & Co.:  Right. Jon Ayers :  There are obviously [indiscernible] like country but they are not, you don\u2019t have these practices. Kevin Alex - Piper Jaffray & Co.: I guess I [indiscernible] figure out I guess how quickly should we see that ramp in. It\u2019s obviously a gigantic market both in the U.S. and outside. Jon Ayers :  Well, we had given an outlook for the 10% to 15% growth this year in Catalyst placements and hematology placements and we\u2019re obviously up to a solid start on that. So, this is something that will occur over time, but feel that\u2019s the pace of ramp that were projecting. We feel good about how we\u2019re executing on that opportunity. Kevin Alex - Piper Jaffray & Co.:  Okay. Thanks. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wilson with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Erin Wilson - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch :  Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Associating with the global initiative PR, where is the focus specifically internationally by geography and where will you be adding an international capacity on the lab side of the business like a new lab similar to what you\u2019ve done in Germany? Did that support that sort of global demand or how you\u2019ll be entering entirely new market here? Jon Ayers :  Yeah. Thank you, Erin for that question. You know what the neat thing is that we really already have a base in almost every market. I would say the market that we really didn\u2019t feel like we had a strong base in was Brazil and now with the acquisition of a wonderful, wonderful distribution organization in which IDEXX aligned very consistent with our culture of entrepreneuralism. We have a strong base in Brazil. Obviously, we\u2019ve been in Europe since early 1990s, we had been in China, for example since 2002. So, it\u2019s really broad based. It\u2019s there really isn\u2019t any market where people have pets. They generally if they have pets, they value their pets and they value more and more. So, whether it\u2019s Europe including Eastern Europe or for example South Africa, we have now gone direct in South Africa and Asia. We are doing very well. I think I may have mentioned in the call, Japan is a very strong market for us, the combination of Catalyst and ProCyte is. Japan is an in-house market that large majority of the testing is done in-house. They like to run in house. We got a very, very competitive portfolio there and our Japan organization really kicked in and gearing starting in Q4 and continued in Q1, and so it\u2019s really across the board. And with regard to labs, we continue to look carefully about how to build out an optimise the lab infrastructure to provide world class service levels. In just little context here in the U.S. the majority of the market will kind of take place today service level for granted, but that\u2019s an innovation outside the U.S. and that\u2019s [indiscernible] picked up results in the evening and provided results the next morning. It wasn\u2019t something that was really being done in continental Europe until we launched the [indiscernible] With its great logistic type of work and it was totally innovative thing. And so we think that combination of the [indiscernible]and our core lab in Lubisberg, Germany really makes a very powerful platform for continental European growth and of course we have strong lab organization in the U.K. Erin Wilson - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch :  Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. And fondly speaking, how would you characterize the profitability of the overseas business relative to the North American business in Companion Animal? Brian McKeon :  It\u2019s a same fundamental economics in terms of the contribution that we get from recurring CAG diagnostics across modalities. I think it is we\u2019re in a relatively earlier stage in investment and the infrastructure given the size of some of the businesses that we built to date. So the U.S. is obviously further along main. So, I think it\u2019s relatively lower, but it\u2019s not driven by fundamentally different economic drivers. It\u2019s more our choice in growth markets to be investing maybe any infrastructure to build the business for the long term and as Jon said I think we see opportunities to do that investment [indiscernible] broadly and over time expect it will yield similar type of returns that what we see in the U.S. Jon Ayers :  Yeah. And I would say I will take the instrument and consumable business. The economics are very attractive around the world taking very little bit by country but overall they are very, very attractive and [indiscernible] we have a mature organization like we have in North America are very, very attractive. Obviously, the places will adjust getting more invested in new lab or starting up the lab organization just as what we, and start a lab anywhere there is an investment period. But I would reinforce what Brian is saying the core economics are quite equally attractive around the world. Erin Wilson - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Thanks you so much. Operator : Our next question will be from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst :  HI. I\u2019m actually Ethan Robb [ph]. I\u2019m for Jon Block. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a first follow-up on Catalyst One I note so early in the lunch. But I was wondering if you could give any commentary on Catalyst One\u2019s contribution to the 36% growth in Catalyst placements and then also are you seeing these Catalyst One placement, why not it\u2019s something placed yet, but are you seeing the customer ordering Catalyst One more new accounts or is it upgrades from that at best? Thanks. Jon Ayers : Yeah. I would say a large majority of what we saw in North America were Catalyst One and obviously Catalyst One has had pre offer and we were placing Catalyst Dx and we have deferred revenue component that Brian mentioned of up $2 million. Our percent placement to what I want to call \u201caccounts that [grow on sold days] [ph]\u201d that would be competitive at these placements or Greenfield accounts or just generally accounts that are new to IDEXX. Brian mentioned that greater than 50% Metric. In North America it was even higher than that, it\u2019s anywhere at 50% or 59%. So, that\u2019s a very attractive \u2013 that\u2019s actually a high point for us in terms of competitive placements. And again one of the metrics that I mentioned I think really speaks the core health of the business and the opportunity for growth that we have. Obviously, we still have VetTest. We don\u2019t have as many VetTest as we used to have little bit more than 10% of our consumables excluding corporate accounts and these are coming from VetTest accounts. But one of the things that we see when we upgraded the VetTest is they grow. They grow their in-house testing by 45% and we don\u2019t fully realise that 45% because we\u2019ve given some rebates to expand the profile with haematology and electrolytes. So, we only achieved 25%, so pretty good. But they\u2019re saying that big uptake in growth and that helps their practice. This is a growth agenda and they see that uptake whether they are upgrading from that test or they are upgrading form a competitive analyser because of the unique nature that are in house lab. That\u2019s the ability to turn results around easily and quickly 8 minutes within the 20-30-minute exam so they see that nice uptake. So, we really are by placing our analysers were expanding the market and so we get growth on both pipes of placements. Obviously when it\u2019s a customer needed IDEXX we get a 100% of that is added to our consumable growth. Unidentified Analyst :  Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up question on the referring flat and you put up a really strong number even with some challenging weather conditions. Could you share us any details on how the business in North America performed relative to international? Jon Ayers :  We had a strong dimension stronger across regions. Europe, interestingly we had questions on the weather dynamic. It actually had good weather in Europe, I think, that helped a bit, but it was relatively stronger growth international but quite solid growth in the U.S. as well and the bulk of that growth was driven by volume gains. So, we feel very good about the health of the business across regions and particularly with some of the headwinds we saw in the U.S. Unidentified Analyst :  Okay. So, one last housekeeping [ph] question here. On a full-year EPS guidance, how you\u2019re thinking about the FpEx impact. It seems as if you\u2019re expecting having six centric [ph] the last time you reported. Now is it just a three centric from FpEx? Jon Ayers :  We changed the methodology there. I\u2019m glad you point that out. We in the past had adjusted how we normalize for FpEx as we had adjusted the current year to prior year rates. We got a new methodology that it kind of leaves our current year numbers as is an adjust to prior years to see all the change in the table. There really isn\u2019t much of a change in terms of the impact of FpEx. If you look at the normalized EPS growth, it\u2019s very similar 11 and 14 or it\u2019s the same. And that\u2019s really just the change you see in a success and three centric [ph] is just related to that, that methodology change is not. There was some slight improvement in that impacts but it wasn\u2019t a material impact. Operator :  Thank you. And as a reminder if you do have any questions or comments press * and then 1. We\u2019ll go to the line of Ross Taylor with CL King. Your line is open. Ross Taylor - CL King & Associates: I had a question related to your comment about you potentially getting to double digit organic growth and you\u2019re able to accelerate to that page. How much would that be dependent on increasing your installed base of customer versus just higher utilization of your existing customer base. Jon Ayers : I don\u2019t know we are both advancer [ph] and third is greater retention and those were kind of some modest price realization as Brian said it\u2019s not a big factor, it\u2019s a small factor but it\u2019s mostly volume both in our in-house, it\u2019s as price of bulk of our growth that we\u2019re exhibiting in first quarter is volume. We think volume is very healthy. We think when we see revenue growth is driven by volume growth and testing is a very healthy dynamic. But it\u2019s going to some about we really see \u2013 if we look as I mentioned are our new comp plan [ph] which rolled on Q1 great success with the North American Veterinary diagnostic consultants. We\u2019ve advising [ph] them to grow a recurring diagnostic revenue and they get what their lost ways to grow it and they were quite successful in doing it and I think there is just a lot there in that opportunity that we see is on tape and it\u2019s going to be utilization, it\u2019s going to be new customer acquisitions with customer retention. Brian McKeon :  I would highlight the key \u2013 we talked about overall growth but obviously the key drive for our business is this recurring CAG diagnostic annuity, which grew 10% in the quarter and that now looks 9% to 11% for the year and what percentage of our total revenue that is 7% of our total revenues? This is a 72% in Q1 and that\u2019s from what we\u2019re trying to drive as a business model at the end of the day that\u2019s what going to drive cash flow on our success economically and we\u2019re feeling very good --- Ross Taylor - CL King & Associates: Just one final question and maybe I missed this in some of your prepared remarks but I guess revenues were a little better than you expected in the first quarter and can you give any comment as to whether in other words certain regions or product areas that really outperformed versus your expectations or whether it was more just across the board? Brian McKeon : I would say two themes to highlight one is just strong execution, very pleased with how the company executed in Q1, a great start to the year. LPD was better than we expected in Q1, we expected a slow ramp down in some of the bovine testing programs in Europe and that\u2019s \u2013 we do expect that to happen and we expect to pressure the balance year on that, but it was delayed a bit in Q1 and I would highlight that as a factor on the margin. Jon Ayers : And the only one on the other margin is, as Brian mentioned briefly we had \u2013 while we had unfavourable weather in the US, we had favourable revenue in Europe and that probably added a little bit to the European performance although that execution fundamentally was very very strong, underlying that \u2013 when you put the two together but it was \u2013 and by the way I don\u2019t think about favourable weather \u2013 it\u2019s not a big as the US. So but probably we are going down the fine points here to answer your question. Operator : We will go to the line of Jeff Frelick from Canaccord Genuity. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, good morning, this is Mark in for Jeff. Wanted to just maybe ask Jon if you can maybe add some color on increase in the field sales organization outside of North America? Can you walk us through or would you be able to quantify number of direct reps you are targeting for 2014 whether it is by region or even by continent? Jon Ayers : Yes, no, I'm not really in the position to do that. It is really very, very country specific and there are a lot of different countries and the \u2013 one interesting thing about that companion animal business is each country is a little different. The core economics are the same, the opportunities the same but the way we execute in each country's a bit different. Part of it is because the way veterinary medicine is taught, it is different by country. So we really take a country specific approach. I think that's one of the strengths of our international organization is we have strong country management, strong entrepreneurial country management, they understand and take advantage of the market opportunity in front of them. They are able to adapt these core strategies to the market in general, as we've mentioned we've gone direct in the Nordics. We've gone direct in South Africa. We've gone direct in Brazil with an acquisition. And other markets we use, some markets we've been direct for 20 years and other markets we have very strong distribution that works well for us, so it is very specific. So it is hard to give numbers there. Unidentified Analyst : And just as a follow-up, obviously weather was an impact in Q1. Could you maybe discuss what your expectations are for vet growth both at practice volume and practice revenue bucket? Jon Ayers : I would say for the balance of the year we really expect the same that we saw for the full year of 2013, which was 2% roughly practice visit growth and 5 to 5.5% I think in terms of practice of revenue for the balance of the year. That\u2019s the US number, obviously outside the US we don\u2019t have the same kind of metrics but generally they are very good growth markets. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. So with that, we will finish here with closing comments. Jon Ayers : I want to thank everybody for joining the call. I also really want to thank all the employees of IDEXX around the world for just a great quarter. I think we are doing great things to bring support and technology to our customers and the companion animal business, we are helping strengthen the bonds that matter, including the pet human bond and the bond between pet owners and the practice. We are bringing great things to the world in terms of our water and life style poultry diary business, and just really phenomenal success, so I really want to thank all \u2013 to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees and we look forward to continuing to update investors with our progress throughout the year in our future calls. That concludes our call. Operator : Again ladies and gentlemen that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",

We do appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue, and if time permits, we'll be more than happy to take your additional question. I would now like to turn the call over to Jon Ayers. Jonathan Ayers : Thank you, Bonnie. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As you can see from the press release, we reported a very strong quarter, driven by our Companion Animal businesses globally, with continuing double-digit recurring diagnostic revenue growth, and a particularly strong quarter in instrument placements, which bodes well for the future of recurring diagnostic revenues. Other segments of our business also did quite well in row, including our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy business and the Water business. Our strategy of investing in innovative products coupled with investments in our go-to-market organization worldwide is working. In that context, today we are announcing exciting plans to take another big step in our commercial capability by moving from a hybrid to an all-direct product distribution in the U.S. for our Companion Animal business in 2015. We have much to cover on the call today. So the overview of the structure of the call is as follows. Brian McKeon, our CFO, will start with a brief review of quarters results, I will then talk about the move to a fully direct strategy in the U.S. Brian will then review the financial benefits and one-time impacts associated with the change, and conclude with opening remarks with the review of our financial outlook in this context, and then we'll open the call to your questions. So with that info, I'll turn it over to Brian. Brian McKeon : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As John noted, I'll be walking through the highlights of our second quarter performance, and we'll come back to discuss our updated 2014 guidance and our preliminary 2015 outlook later in the call. In reviewing our quarterly results, please note that growth rates refer to Q2 2014 performance compared to Q2 2013 performance, unless otherwise noted. Also, when we refer to normalized organic growth, in addition to adjusting for exchange and acquisitions, we've adjusted for changes in distributor inventory levels. In terms of highlights for the quarter, Q2 was another strong quarter for revenue growth, driven by global momentum in CAG recurring diagnostic revenues and better than expected performance in LPD. Total company organic growth of 9% was driven by normalized CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth of 12% with strong gains across regions. We also delivered solid EPS results, while strengthening our cash flows and capital structure. Operating margins were as expected, which reported delivery of $1.10 in EPS in Q2, an 11% year-on-year increase. We continue to drive very strong cash flows in business and took advantage of favorable market conditions to advance financings that will term out $200 million of our debt structure at very attractive interest rates. We're executing very well against our growth strategy, which has raise our confidence in our financial outlook, which we'll discuss in more detail later in the call. Let's go through a breakdown of our quarterly performance, starting with a brief overview of our regional performance. We continue to driver strong growth across regions supported by strong momentum in our CAG business. We had an excellent quarter in the U.S. Revenues were $225 million with total normalized organic growth of 11%, reflecting solid gains across business segments, including 12% growth in CAG recurring diagnostic revenues. Underlying demand in the U.S. improved from the tough weather impacts we saw in Q1. Our analysis of U.S. clinic-level data for practices that we track, show that patient visits were up 0.6% and practice revenue grew 4.3% in Q2. Our international business also posted another excellent quarter. International revenues increased 12% to $165 million or 42% of total revenues, reflecting 9% organic growth. International CAG recurring diagnostic revenues increased 11% normalized, supported by strong growth in instrument consumables and reference-led services in Europe, and continued double-digit gains in Asia-Pacific. Globally, high levels of instrument placement set the stage for continued expansion of durable CAG recurring revenues. Catalyst placements increased 34% year-on-year to nearly 800. We placed nearly 500 Catalyst, a North American order, with over 60% going to customers new to IDEXX in-house chemistry. The new sales force structure is executing very well and we're seeing benefits from the Catalyst One introductory offer. Catalyst placements were also very strong in international markets with about 30% placement gains in both Europe and Asia. As a reminder, international markets were placing only Catalyst Dx ahead of future plans for global rollout of Catalyst One, which will further expand the market for Catalyst technology. Worldwide hematology placements grew 13% in the quarter. Results were supported by strong growth in North America, where we're having success both in bundling LaserCyte, as part of the Catalyst One introductory offer; and in placing ProCytes, which account for 60% of total placements. International hematology placement gains in the quarter were moderated by timing issues, in part reflecting early shipments of orders in markets like Japan this year in Q1, ahead of sales tax changes. We also continue to see rapid customer adoption of our SNAP Pro for mobile device. We placed 1,700 SNAP Pros in the quarter, bringing our installed base to 2,900 and setting the foundation for continued expansion of our rapid assay modality. Global instrument revenue of $19 million was down 10% organically in Q2, reflecting about $3 million revenue deferrals associated with the Catalyst One introductory offer. We expect that instrument revenue growth will lag placement growth this year, reflecting high placements at relatively lower priced analyzer such as Catalyst One and the overall expansion in international markets. CAG recurring diagnostic revenues, or revenues associated with instrument consumables and service, rapid assay test kits and lab services, were $282 million in the second quarter, representing 72% of overall revenues. Normalized organic revenue growth was 12%. A decline in U.S. distributor inventories to 2.8 weeks at the end of Q2 from 3.4 weeks at the end of Q1, reduced reported growth in CAG recurring diagnostic revenues by about 1% in the quarter. Continued expansion of the CAG recurring annuity in the quarter reflects robust global gains across our three modalities. Instrument consumable revenues were $89 million with normalized organic growth of 13%. Growth continues to be driven by our steadily expanding and increasingly loyal installed base and increased testing, as customers upgrade to our premium instruments. Note, Catalyst customers now account for 90% of our U.S. chemistry consumable revenue, excluding corporate accounts, and we see greater than 99% retention on our Catalyst slide purchases. Revenues for rapid assay test kits were $49 million in Q2. This reflects normalized organic growth of 11%, benefiting in part from a rebound and testing post to weather-related impacts experienced in North America in Q1. We expect benefits from the strong launch of SNAP Pro will support solid continued growth in the contribution of rapid assay to recurring diagnostic revenues. Our reference lab and consulting services grew 11% organically to $129 million in Q2. High growth continued in all of the regions around the world, driven almost entirely by volume. In North America, the diagnostic sales force model and continued option of VetConnect PLUS continues to help generate an increase in the level of diagnostics being run by our customers, while also improving on our already-strong customer retention rates. Our Practice Management and Digital Imagining Systems business with revenues of $26 million in Q2 grew organically by 20%. Our more tenured sales force is growing our base of pet health network Pro customers, and is helping to drive system and instrument placements. We're also seeing strong growth in the service components of this business. Our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues grew 14% in Q2, excluding exchange impacts of $33 million, reflecting organic growth of 6% and benefits from the acquisition of our Brazil distributor last year. Organic revenue growth was supported by increased sales in China coupled with increased testing in New Zealand related to Livestock exports. We continue to benefit from a slower than expected ramp down in bovine programs in Western Europe. Although, we do anticipate these impacts will moderate gains in LPD in the second half of 2014. Our Water business grew 9% in Q2 to $24 million, including benefits from the acquisition of our South African distributor. Organic revenue growth for quarter was 7%, reflecting gains in our North America and Asia-Pacific regions. The growth continues to be driven primarily from our core total coliform/E. coli testing products primarily due to new customer acquisitions. Solid profit results in Q2 were driven by strong revenue growth with operating margins and cash flow tracking as expected. Gross profit was up 11% in line with revenue growth, as gross margins were flat year-on-year. Pricing gains were offset by comparisons to prior-year foreign exchange contract gains and relatively higher freight and distribution cost, in part due to the success of the Catalyst One introductory offer. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue were up 100 basis points as expected, mainly due to the worldwide investment in sales and marketing that are driving our accelerated revenue growth. Fully diluted EPS was $1.10 for the quarter, up 11% year-on-year and a $1.99 year-to-date, also up 11%. Free cash flow was $98 million year-to-date or 94% of net income. Our strong cash flows have enabled continued allocation of capital for share repurchases. We repurchased 973,000 shares for about a $126 million during the quarter and our board recently authorized a repurchase of 5 million additional shares, which is on top of the 1.4 million remaining from our previous authorization. We also continue to strengthen our balance sheet. We expanded our revolver in June to $700 million reflecting growth in our business. We also advanced steps to add $200 million in low fixed rate term debt through a $125 million private placement of seven and 10 year senior notes that close in July and execution of an agreement for an additional $75 million of 12 senior notes with funding anticipated in September. Interest rates on the senior notes range from 3.3% to 3.8%. We'll use the proceeds from these offerings to pay down our revolver resulting in a structure with substantial flexibility and low overall financing cost. That concludes our review of the quarter. I'll now turn the call back to Jon to discuss our plans to move to an all-direct product distribution approach in the U.S. Jonathan Ayers : Thank you, Brian. We believe that move to an all-direct U.S. distribution model will be a strong enabler of long-term growth for our companion animal business in the U.S. and we are confident in our plans to enable this change, but first a bit of background. Our strategy focused on an integrated diagnostic solution for both reference labs and point-of-care diagnostics, it's highly successful in gaining momentum in the U.S. veterinary market. The sales transformation undertaken in 2013 to a Veterinary Diagnostic Consultant sales role or VDC, a VDC that represents IDEXX and serves the customer with our integrated offering has also been highly effective. The Q2 results show that our growth momentum continues to accelerate. We are seeing the significant benefits of smaller territories, a single customer contact for diagnostics, and greater call frequency by IDEXX. To this point, we analyze the growth and IDEXX revenues from customers called on at least once by us in the first half of 2014 versus those that we did not call on. The good news is that while both customer groups grew, the customers that we visited grew at least 9% faster. Interesting, with these new structure, we reach most of the market, but we didn't reach it all and we still don't have the resources to call frequently enough to adequately serve all the customers and maximize growth. So here are the key elements of our plan to fully go-direct in the U.S. First, this change affects how we distribute our rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables or kits and consumables, which comprise a minority of our U.S. CAG revenues. The majority of our companion animal group revenues we derive from U.S. customers are already derived direct, as are majority of our CAG revenues internationally. Second, the change to an all-direct distribution will be effective on January 1, 2015, after the expiration of our current annual contracts with our U.S. distribution partners for kits and consumables. Until then we will continue to work with our distributors under the current contract terms. Third, under the new direct approach IDEXX will provide all the elements of the value chain for kits and consumables. As a result, we will recognize revenue at the practice level on this set of products instead of at distribution, capturing about $50 million to $55 million in pro forma annual CAG recurring revenue in 2015. Fourth, as we won't be using U.S. third-party distribution starting in 2015, at that time distributors that are currently exclusive to us will now be free to carry competitive diagnostic products at that time. In anticipation of going fully direct in 2015, we will significantly enhance and expand our U.S. commercial organization in the latter half of 2014. So a couple of points on this. First, we'll be expanding from a 125 to 174 Veterinary Diagnostic Consultants, VDC, in corresponding territories, a nearly 40% Increase in feet on the street. Now, this expansion is a relatively straightforward as the sales model's already been implemented and scaled across the U.S. and no field reps are being displace as part of this expansion. We are decreasing territory size allowing for a greater density of coverage, recruiting sales personnel through a proven recruiting model, and we are expanding sales coverage to geographies previously covered only through telephone sales. We've already announced this change for our U.S. sales organization and the reaction has been very positive, as you can imagine. Second, with more dense territories, Veterinary Diagnostics Consultants are able to increase their calls per week by another 15%. So together with the expansion, this increase equates to a 60% increase in total calls with customers as compared to where we are today. Third, we're also adding 25 more field service representatives or FSRs to our force of 48, a 52% expansion. Field service reps would typically have extensive prior experience and practice as a veterinary technician and extensive training from IDEXX, play a highly valued role in supporting our customers use of diagnostics, including growing the adoption of VetConnect PLUS. Fourth, we're increasing our insight sales and order taking representatives from 24 to 68. And fifth, we are adding a cadre of regional based professional service veterinarians to support our customers with the medicine behind our advance diagnostic offering, including the clinical support for our test technologies and the appropriate use of ever growing specialized test portfolio, which even today quite frankly is vastly underpenetrated in the customer base. So those are the details of what we are doing. Let me comment on the strategic benefits. First, our field sales and support expansion that I just went through will be valued by customers and support our long-term growth goals. As we have seen when we call on customers, they accelerate their growth of IDEXX. We've also determined through our data analytics, the customers who use the full IDEXX diagnostics solution grow their practices diagnostics faster than those who don't. And thus diagnostics become a larger part of their practice to the betterment of their patients' health. This makes sense as we have brought a series of new innovations to the market. In 2015, we will have substantially more resources to provide the consulting support that customer need to better promote diagnostics' pet owners as part of the Pet Care Plan, growing IDEXX recurring revenues with these customers, what some may refer to as same-store sales. In addition, calling on customers more regularly -- even more regularly also increases customer retention and also helps us expose a greater part of the market to the benefits of IDEXX's innovated, integrated approach to the three diagnostic modalities. So second, this also leverages integration. In the context of our integrated diagnostic solution offering, paired with an integrated diagnostics sales role, the VDC, we found that our current hybrid model of distributing some elements of the diagnostic solution direct, reference labs, point-of-care instrumentation, telemedicine, for example and other elements through third-party distribution, rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables, creates complexity that doesn't add value for our customers. It's kind of crazy when you think about it, a practice who's patient needs a diagnostic profile, where some of the tests in that profile are run immediately on the IDEXX in-house lab. And some of the elements of that profile are sent to the IDEXX reference lab. One patient, one profile, one integrated solution supported by one IDEXX field sales and service team. In this context, it creates greater value and efficiencies for customers when all the components of this profile come directly from IDEXX. And we are confident we can manage this expansion effectively through the balance of the year and into 2015, so a couple of points on that. First, as mentioned, the majority of our U.S. CAG revenues are already direct, reference labs, instruments, software, digital radiography and telemedicine. We also serve certain corporate accounts with the direct model today. Thus, we have the underlying systems processes and infrastructure to support a fully direct approach in the U.S. Second, we know our customers. In fact, we believe we already interfaced with over 99% of U.S. veterinary practices. And through our data analytics capability, we believe we know the U.S. veterinary market and our customers, and all the customers, better than any one else in the industry. As part of this capability, we know in detail our customers histories and buying habits for kits and consumables. Third, IDEXX's customer retention in the U.S. is very high for kits and consumables, as we've mentioned on prior calls and has been increasing. Today, we stand at 97% and 99% in kits and consumables, up 2% roughly in the past 18 months. High retention is the result of a couple of things that have been going on. First, the highly loyal installed base of the instrument customers, including a rapidly growing installed base of SNAP Pro customers for our rapid assay test kits. Second, a unique and expansive proprietary test menu, a test that they can only get from IDEXX. Third, increasing usage of VetConnect PLUS, a valued way to access a pet's diagnostic results and history real-time and with mobile. Again, a solutions that's unique to IDEXX. And fourth, our new VDC sales model where we are far more frequently calling on and thus supporting our existing customers of IDEXX diagnostics. So more evidence on why we can do this effectively. We have a fully direct and go-to-market model in most major international countries today. So this approach is not new to us. In fact, the U.S. is behind IDEXX Europe in that regard. We have demonstrated successful change management capability through the North American sales transformation in 2013. In addition, we've completed several successful go-direct initiatives internationally recently. This includes the four Nordic countries, where we have seen accelerating organic revenue growth beyond the one-time margin capture as a result of going direct. And so while we have work to do to bring out the change in the U.S., we're fully confident in our ability to execute and we have the track record to prove it. In summary, I think you will see that the transition to a fully direct approach in the U.S. is a natural evolution of our strategy. We believe the benefits will be profound and historic for IDEXX and the impact we will have on the growth and relevance of the veterinary profession in the U.S. The change will help us accelerate the appropriate use of diagnostics for the care of the pet, growing our market, our revenues and our profitability, while serving practices, pet owners and pets alike. So let me now turn it over to Brian to discuss in detail the financial elements of the change. Brian McKeon : Thanks, Jon. Implementing an all-direct product distribution strategy in the U.S. will provide meaningful incremental ongoing benefits to revenues and operating profits. As Jon noted, through this approach, we estimate our revenues will increase by $50 million to $55 million in 2015, as we recognized full revenue on consumable and rapid assay sales and capture current distributor margins. This will provide a 5% increase to our CAG diagnostics recurring revenues that will grow as we continue to expand our franchise. The change will also be accretive. We estimate annual operating profit benefits beginning in 2015 of $5 million to $8 million annually that will scale over time. This benefit is net of the incremental ongoing cost to substantially enhance our sales capability and to provide full order to fulfillment services for our customers. Moving to a fully direct approach will involve transitional impacts associated with sales and operational cost ramp in 2014, and one-time effects associated with project implementation and the drawdown of distributor inventories. As we move forward, we'll highlight these transitional impacts discretely, as they don't affect our underlying business fundamentals. In 2014, this will result in $18 million to $20 million in transition cost or an estimated $0.23 to $0.25 per share EPS impact. In the second half of 2014, we estimate that we'll incur $8 million in incremental cost as we ramp sales and operating resources ahead of the planned January 2015 change to the all-direct model. Beginning in 2015, these costs will be covered by the benefits from distributor margin capture and are included in our estimate for net accretive operating profit benefit from the change. We also expect to incur $10 million to $12 million in one-time cost in the second half of 2014 associated with the implementation. This includes internal and external project management cost and one-time transition cost related to enabling the new sales organization. In 2015, we also expect to incur one-time impacts, primarily associated with the drawdown of distributor inventories. At yearend 2014, we estimate that there will be approximately 3.5 weeks of inventories on hand with distributors. Our direct sales in 2015 will need to reflect that these inventories will also be sold through to customers by our distributors in early 2015. This will have the effect of a one-time offset of our projected revenues of $30 million to $35 million and $23 million to $27 million in operating profits. We also anticipate that we'll have $2 million to $3 million of remaining one-time project management cost in early 2015. Let's now review our financial outlook in the context of these changes. We'll begin with our baseline outlook for 2014, before transitional impacts associated with the U.S. all-direct product distribution approach. Today, we're raising this outlook reflecting strong underlying momentum in our business. We're raising our full year organic revenue growth outlook for 2014 to 9% to 9.5% or $1.51 billion to $1.52 billion in projected revenue, reflecting strong global momentum in CAG and better than expected year-to-date performance in LPD. Please note that this outlook assumes that distributor inventory levels in the year at about 3.5 weeks, within our normal 3 to 4 week range. We're also tightening our 2014 guidance range for EPS as adjusted, which excludes transitional impacts associated with the distribution change to $3.79 to $3.86 or 11% to 14% adjusted growth. Benefits from higher revenue growth are partially offset by about $0.02 in higher interest expense associated with the new term debt. This reflects expectations for about $14 million of interest expense this year. Our outlook assumes relatively flat year-on-year operating margins for the full year and the tax rate of around 31% for the second half of the year. As noted transitional impacts associated with the move to the all-direct product distribution model in the U.S. will reduce 2014 operating profits by about $18 million to $20 million or $0.23 to $0.25 per share. We expect these impacts in total will be balanced relatively evenly across Q3 and Q4. Incorporating these impacts, our new reported EPS guidance for 2014 is $3.54 to $3.63. Today, we're providing a preliminary view on 2015 as well. Given strong momentum in our business, our outlook is for 9% to 10% baseline revenue growth and relatively flat operating margins before transitional impacts related to the new distribution approach. As noted, we expect that the all-direct distribution approach will add $50 million to $55 million to CAG recurring revenues and $5 million to $8 million to operating profits in 2015. This is on top of the baseline outlook. These benefits will be offset by one-time reductions of $30 million to $35 million to projected revenues and $25 million to $30 million to operating profits associated with distributor inventory draw downs and one-time transition cost. As noted, we'll track these one-time impacts discretely, so our underline business fundamentals are clear. We'll also provide an update on our preliminary 2015 guidance on our Q3 call. That concludes our review. John and I would now be happy to take your questions. Operator, we'll be happy to take questions now. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And our first question, we'll go to the line of Erin Wilson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Erin Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : As it relates to the direct sales effort, it doesn't look like you're gaining much in a way of economics here. How do you justify the stuff that's expensed in CapEx, working capital requirements and strategic risk associated with this sort of transition? And what's the next move to here? How is this a platform for that next strategic move? Jonathan Ayers : Well, I guess, Erin, we believe that we will be gaining a pretty significant strategic benefit. Of course, we have, as Brian noted, the distribution margin capture of $50 million, $55 million with $5 million to $8 million incremental profit drop through that comes on top of our baseline guidance. But more importantly, what I went through is a fairly significant expansion in our direct model. And the point is that we believe we're more effective in representing our diagnostics, when we can represent it all together. And we're more effective directly representing through distribution. Just to give you an example, with SNAP Pro placements in Q2, the vast majority of those placements were done by IDEXX. And you know, while we worked really hard with our distributors to help, they really just weren't much of a factor. We know how to talk directly with our customers, whether with our field sales force, with our phone sales force, we just think that they're doing it. So that's a pretty significant increase in field resources on our already proven and successful model. So we believe this really positions us well for long-term double-digit organic revenue growth in the companion animal market in North America. Brian McKeon : I'd just add to Jon's comment about the strategic benefits that from a financial point of view, the benefits that we highlighted on an ongoing basis are an incremental recurring annuity benefit that will grow in scale over time. So I think the financial benefits beyond the strategic benefits are meaningful as well. Jonathan Ayers : And also the impact on the balance sheet is really de minimis, so impact on inventory and working capital, its de minimis. So that's really not a necessary element of the expansion. Erin Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And you spoke to this a little bit, but what sort of fluctuations are you expecting as these distribution relationships kind of wind down here with potential channel stuffing in the second half. Jonathan Ayers : Well, we don't expect any -- we expect steady as you go. And I believe that's what customers want. Customers want steady as you go. I think that's a customer-centric approach. They want to buy product when they need it and we expect to manage our distributor inventory accordingly. Erin Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just one last quick one. VetConnect PLUS is obviously key to implementing this sort of strategy. Are you seeing the improved retention rates that you initially anticipated and what percent of your addressable customer base is currently active now? Jonathan Ayers : So we have around 14,600 VetConnect PLUS activations. That has just continued to expand its presence in our customer base in the U.S., and of course internationally, too, because we're in several international markets, but I think the relevant question here is, is the U.S. -- and as I've mentioned, the retention that we have on kits instruments -- consumable and kits, its 97% to 99%. And I think that's in part as a result of how people are valuing VetConnect PLUS and not only the historical trending, but the mobile app is very successful. It really helps with real-time care when the results pop up on the vet or the tech's iPhone, when they're in the exam room. And so an expansion of our field service reps who have been very helpful to us in teaching customers how to use VetConnect PLUS in practice is going to help us to continue to really finish out the growth and the adoption of VetConnect PLUS in the marketplace. Operator : And we'll go to the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Ryan Daniels - William Blair : Jon or Bryan, the $50 million to $55 million you talked about capturing in 2015, is that purely the margin that you'll capture from not giving that to the distributors or does that incorporate enhanced sales to the end-market from this distribution change. Jonathan Ayers : That's up. That's the former. It's purely the margin capture on a pro forma basis for what we see to be the growth of our expected revenues in 2015 for kits and consumables. It doesn't reflect any additional. Ryan Daniels - William Blair : And the $5 million to $8 million, just to be very clear, before transition cost, that incorporates both the investments you'll make in the sales force expansion as well as all your distribution cost and capabilities? Brian McKeon : Correct. That's correct. And the way this is phasing is we'll obviously have, that will be ramping in 2014 before we get the revenue benefit. So we're highlighting that there is a incremental expense that wasn't in our outlook before, but as we get into 2015, that's embedded in the $50 million to $55 million and the $5 million to $8 million. Jonathan Ayers : Yes. That the difference between the $50 million and $55 million and the $5 million to $8 million is, of course, the cost of physical distribution and the ramp-up of that rather significant and effective direct presence. Ryan Daniels - William Blair : And then maybe a broader question. As you look at this change over the long-term, do you think the bigger opportunity is to increase utilization within your existing accounts, which is already quite robust in the United States or share gains? I know you probably want to accomplish both, but do you see a bigger opportunity to increase that $50 million to $55 million from one of those avenues? Jonathan Ayers : Well, a simple answer to that is both. We've seen that when we've gone direct. And we've gone direct in seven international markets in the last two years, when we have a direct presence which is more effective. And a lot of those international markets, it's not as much about share gain, it's about expanding the market. And we believe the same opportunities here in the U.S. As I mentioned in my upfront call and my upfront comments, we have a very, very good understanding of our customers' use to diagnostics in the context to their total practice revenues. And we know that there are a lot of things that customers want to do to grow their practices. And the key driver to growing their practices in diagnostics is, in fact, diagnostics historically grows 2% and 2.5% higher than overall practice revenues, but we believe we could actually accelerate that. And that's why we've got to have these veterinary diagnostic consultants and what I would consider a fairly intense presence. We're now at the scale in the U.S. to be able to have that kind of presence. Interesting fact here Ryan is that the other category leaders in the veterinary market are also direct. And so really all we're doing is we're taking a full category, in fact an industry leadership position, we believe this will actually be beneficial to the entire profession, because we will help practices, respond to the challenges and opportunities they have to increase the relevance of pet care with pet owners. We know pet owners want more pet care when they're well informed, and it's up to us to help veterinarians achieve that objective of informing pet owners. And through this direct, we're going to be far more effective in doing it, then with our hybrid approach of some direct and some distribution. Brian McKeon : And Ryan, I'd highlight the $50 million to $55 million from a financial point of view, of course, is just the margin capture related to rapid assay kits and consumables, about 40% increase in feet on the street, 60% increase in call frequency, will benefit all of our revenues, not just those two modalities. Operator : And we'll go to the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Jon Block - Stifel: Jon, maybe you can just speak high level, why now? I mean certainly you've rolled out a lot of innovation over the past couple of years and people have already mention VetConnect PLUS, amongst a couple of other things. But can you speak to, why now, did you initiate this or was there something from the distributors that may want the better economics. If you could talk to that, that'd be very helpful? Jonathan Ayers : This was completely our initiative. And the answer to that question is, we saw the pretty dramatic effectiveness of the Veterinary Diagnostic Consultant sales model. We went into that model in the third quarter last year, and every quarter since then it's gotten better and better. And when we call on customers, their revenues go up with IDEXX, and their practice success goes up. And then as we looked at it, we simply, we felt we needed to be fully direct to really leverage the benefit of that change. The other thing that became more and more clear to us, we've been talking about this, but it's really happening in practice. It's not about a lab business or an instrument business or even rapid assay business. Now, we've launched SNAP Pro and we're turning the rapid assay business through a value-added step of the SNAP Pro into an installed base business model. All of these things coming together thorough VetConnect PLUS, it's very clear that it is the integrated diagnostic solution. So what we are finding was that, we were kind of wrapping ourselves around in a pretzel to be able to go part direct and part distribution, it was adding a lot of cost, it was adding a lot of complexity. And we felt that by now, we have the veterinary diagnostic channel, it just became clear that this was the right move to make. And that's not to say that we don't value the relationships we've had with our distributors over the many years that we worked with them, and we respect them and we value them. It just turns out, we believe, we're going to be a lot more effective by using that $50 million to $55 million or the good chunk of it. Some of it obviously drops to the bottomline by enhancing our direct capability. We know how to have a conversation with a customer about the diagnostic category that someone who is representing 1,000 different products is simply not able to do. They simply can't do it in the way that we can do it. Jon Block - Stifel: And then maybe just part two of that question, if I could. How about any relationships internationally, I mean, clearly I think you've got a big one with Henry Schein in international market. So can you speak to, does that completely remain intact and do you think there is any ramifications with Schein in international markets? Jonathan Ayers : I would just say that internationally every country is unique. Within our Schein distributor, we had a distributor that we felt really wasn't representing us well in the Nordics. We went direct. We got not only the margin capture, but we've had accelerating organic revenue growth beyond the margin capture in the Nordic countries. A set of markets, we think is very appropriate for our diagnostic innovations. We've gone direct in South Africa, it's kind of a different situation, but we felt that was right. So every market is a little bit different, but I think we've been very successful I think at seven different markets in the last two years we've moved. And some markets were hybrids, some markets were fully distribution, some markets we've been direct. The continental European markets and the U.K., we've been direct in those markets for a long time. I'm talking decades. This is not new to us. We know how to do this. And so as we looked at that, we realized that in some markets, where we didn't have distributors that was as strong as we'd like, and they were more of emerging market situation, that moving direct helps us to grow. And I think that has been a contributor to what Brian has laid out is pretty strong first half international growth, over 30% increase in catalyst Dx placements. I mean we haven't even mentioned Catalyst One in the international market yet, and we're getting very, very strong growth in instrument replacements. I think that's because we're really developing and we're rolling out of our direct capability in some of these markets and improving our capability in those, where we're already direct. Jon Block - Stifel: And last question, and you guided this a little bit, but maybe just a bit more clarity. You gave a lot of figures, exact figures, on where you're going with fields reps and service reps here in the U.S. to go direct. How do you know that's the right size? I mean is it a function Jon of been there, done that internationally, and therefore you feel very comfortable that the infrastructure that you alluded to in detail in the U.S. is going to get the job done from a service standpoint? Jonathan Ayers : I think that's right. We know our market in U.S. We know our reach and frequency today in the VDC model. We know our presence in these customers. We know our customers buying habits very well. I don't think there is anyone who understands, not only their own market, but the entire market through our data analytic capability and the numbers that we typically present with regard to visit and revenue growth. I mean there is no one who has that kind of data that we have. So we know the market very well. We've spent a fair amount of time in the last couple of months mapping this out. And quite frankly, Jon, what we did is we mapped it out. We said this is what we need, and then we said let's add 20%. Let's just totally nail it as an insurance policy. That's how we approached it. Operator : And we'll go to the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray : Jon, I guess just a few more follow-up questions here. I can understand shifting the strategy, if you have bad distribution partners like you mentioned in the Nordic region, but I guess what does this message send to Butler Schein, Patterson, MWI in the U.S.? I mean do you think that's going to cause some near-term disruptions with the distributors? Jonathan Ayers : I really don't want to speak for them. And they have been valued distributor partners, and they have been good partners. I think what we concluded was in the context of already being direct with a part of our diagnostic solution, and by the way a majority of U.S. revenues are already direct today with IDEXX, that the model of going through distribution was a model we needed to move from, because it lived its useful life. So I don't think this is a comment on our distributors and the great work that they do with other manufacturers. I think it's a situation that I can't comment on the rest of the market, but very specific to us. We feel this was the right change. And I just would leave it at that. Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray : You might have mentioned this and I might have missed, and I am sorry. But have you guys reached out to on the vet practice customers, and I guess what sort of reaction do you think they'll have? Are you expecting much turnover, if any? Jonathan Ayers : I'll tell you what, vet practices, when we do our surveys with vet practices, the number one thing they say, we'd like you to call on us more frequently. We'd like more support from you. We'd like to have maybe a professional service vet show up and tell us a little bit about the clinically efficacy of some of your specialized test. When we look at our specialized test, while they've grown very meaningfully, they're a small fraction. We believe the specialized tests penetration in the U.S., when we look at the number customers who are using versus the number of customers that should be using, whether it's our cardiac or molecular diagnostics, the list goes on, it's like 10% penetration. It should be 10 times of what it is. And customers want to do it, but they need people to help them in practice to educate them. So we're adding this cadre of a dozen professional service vets as part of this expansion. We're expanding obviously the whole infrastructure, to have more time in front of customers, and this is really responding. And what customers are saying, they're saying we'd like to see more of you, we don't see enough of you. We know you have really good technology. We're here in practice, it's a challenging situation. We need your help. And with this new VDC model now, we're able to call on existing significant customers that are already using all three of our modalities, what we call IDEXX Diagnostic Advantage Customers and are already doing well. But in fact, we can accelerate the same-store sales growth of those by them, adopting some of the additional specialized test and other innovations that we bring. But we need to call them in order to do that. And so this new model that we launched last year, the Veterinary Diagnostic Consultant model, and at that time the 60% increase in calls allow us to do it. And now we're going to do another 60%. So that's 60% growth on top of 60% growth. I don't know it gets around to 250% growth. We're going to be in front of customers now enough to really help them expand their appropriate use of diagnostic. Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray : And then just lastly on the reference lab business, do you think you're gaining share? Again, I might have missed that, if you talked about in the prepared remarks. Brian McKeon : We mentioned that we grew globally 11% and that was basically all volumes. So I think from a volume point of view, we're doing quite well in terms of how we're growing our business relative to the market. Jonathan Ayers : And that add contributions from all regions. Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray : Would you say 11% is comparable to the U.S. market as well? Brian McKeon : Very strong growth, U.S. and internationally, we don't break that out specifically. Jonathan Ayers : As you know, we gave out the total growth in recurring diagnostic revenues for Europe. Operator : And we'll go to line of Ross Taylor with CL King. Ross Taylor - CL King : I am just trying to look beyond 2015 a little bit. And the incremental profit of $5 million to $8 million that you talk about gaining in 2015, do you see that growing beyond 2015, because you're able to leverage some of these incremental cost you're going to add. Can you leverage them substantially or is the incremental growth that's going to come beyond 2015, really just going to result from revenue growth? Brian McKeon : We would expect benefits from revenue growth, of course. And we do expect that we can scale the structure as we grow. We're making a meaningful upfront investment here to enhance our customer coverage, as Jon has talked about in detail. And we think we're going to have the right kind of infrastructure in place. So as we continue to grow and build off of this, we should be able to get additional scale benefits over time. Jonathan Ayers : I think we will see the revenue growth, but just to your point on leverage and scale, we design this really to be the optimal VDC territory alignment for 2016, right. So as we grow whatever way, we're going to grow between 2015 and 2016. We would expect to see some operating leverage on the sale structure. Ross Taylor - CL King : And second question I have is I would imagine that your distributors are pretty disappointed about this, from the top levels of management you're kind of all the way down to the distributor reps. And do you anticipate that they're going to work a lot harder to make up for losing your revenues by working harder to grow your competition. And I wonder, does the direct sales model, is it maybe more efficient or more effective with larger clinics as opposed to smaller clinics, so do you maybe end up giving up some of those smaller clinics? Jonathan Ayers : No. We're going to call on all the clinics. When we talk about reach and frequency, it's really talking about calling on everybody in the territory, as well as a very capable inbound and outbound call center. We know how to do this. And so I think the bottomline is we have a very differentiated products in what goes through distribution. Let's remind ourselves what goes through distribution today and will by the way through the end of the year of 2014. It is instrument consumables. So that's based on having bought the instrument. Obviously, in Q2 we're doing pretty good with continued instrument placements, right. And then, you've got the rapid assay test kits, which all by the way, is now becoming an instrument business model with SNAP Pro, but also very differentiated tests, really a unique and proprietary test portfolio. So this is not something -- a distributor rep, if I could speak for, they want to have a good relationship with the customer, that they're kind of more customer-focused than they are product-focused, I mean that's their role. So when things are really working, and I'm not going to go and try to upset the applecart for very tiny, what's going to end up being a very, very small product category for them, when they're covering that, when they got a thousand different products. So I think the strength of our product portfolio is really combined with all the differentiators that we've added, whether it's VetConnect PLUS or SNAP Pro or -- and the customer's high degree of satisfaction, very, very high customer satisfaction rates in our instruments and our rapid assay test kits, this stuff is working for them. And in many cases they can't replace it with a like-for-like product. Ross Taylor - CL King : And if I can maybe just sneak in one other question just related to lab. You said that the growth was primarily volume? And is that statement kind of applicable across all the geographies as well including the U.S.? Jonathan Ayers : Yes. Operator : And we'll go to line of Nick Jansen with Raymond James. Nick Jansen - Raymond James : Regarding your preliminary 2015 outlook, prior to all this changes, it looks like you were expecting operating margins to be flat in '15. And I was just wondering, better understanding some of the investments you're making maybe outside the U.S. to just kind of explain that, because I would have thought with the recurring revenue piece growing in the double-digits that you would have at least gotten some level of leverage next year irrespective of business. Jonathan Ayers : Well, one comment we'll also make along with that comment on margins is that the organic revenue growth guidance is 9% to 10%. So I think that's a nice goal. We've had a long-term goal to get to double-digit organic revenue growth. And it takes operating investment to make that happen. But I'll turn it to Brian. Brian McKeon : So we're obviously early. We wanted to provide a baseline for everyone to help them understand how these impacts would add to a baseline outlook for the company. I think that we are very much committed to driving strong profit growth and faster EPS growth on top of the strong revenue gains. I think in terms of the momentum that you're seeing in the business right now it's reflective of the growth investments that we're making. And our anticipation right now is we're in period of accelerating growth. We want to ensure that we're investing appropriately behind it. These are investments that yield annuity returns, very high returns for us, and we are anticipating, we're going to continue to invest against things like international, commercial capability, and infrastructure, and R&D and that all factors into our flat operating margin outlook. Jonathan Ayers : So I want to highlight also one -- reinforce one point that Brian made. We're giving guidance for 2015 here in July. We'd hoped typically do it in October, but we have the confidence to do this time in July. We wanted to provide a baseline, so you'll understood the impacts of going direct. But the fact is how many companies are providing 2015 guidance right now. We have a very enduring, predictable recurring revenue consistently growing market that allows us to be able to do this with a confidence you need to in order to give these kind of guidance. So it's relatively early for us. It's fastly early for most companies, but we're in the position to be able to do, we thought it would be helpful to you as you analyze the changes that we're talking about today. Operator : And we'll go to line of Ben Haynor with Feltl and Company. Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company : Just a quick point of clarification on the $50 million to $55 million in annual revenue due to the distribution model change, is that inclusive of $30 million to $35 million one-time inventory drawdown impact, or I guess in other words, for 2016, would you expect that to be $50-plus million or $80-plus million? Brian McKeon : The $50 million to $55 million is the pro forma increase that comes from the margin capture. In early 2015, there will be an offset to that of $30 million to $35 million, so approximately the net number would be approximately $20 million, right. And that is a one-time offset as the distributors are in the market and winding down their product sales. So as you go to 2016, the benefit would be $50 million to $55 million, plus the growth that we'd anticipate delivering in -- excuse me, in 2016, it will be the $50 million to $55 million-plus the growth that we would be driving in 2016. Jonathan Ayers : The organic growth in that, right. So also that's obviously that drawdown will be relatively concentrated to 3.5 weeks. So it's going to be relative to concentrated impact. Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company : And then for my second question, you mentioned that customers, they called on in the first half grew 9% faster than those that you didn't call on. I would assume that you're typically calling on customers that represent higher volumes of testing. Could you kind of give an estimate of what type of volumes that you -- of the customers that you did touch, is it 60% of the volume that you generated, 90% of the volume, where does that kind of fall? Jonathan Ayers : First of all, the number, it was a broad number. And we had to make at least one call in the half year. That's not enough to really have an impact on that, a big impact on the customer, but that was just the way that we measured it. It was obviously the vast majority of the volume, but we would more like to be calling on customers, our customers, on the average of once or twice a quarter. And of course, with customers that have opportunities, significant opportunities to grow more frequently than that. So there is really a spectrum all over the math of the call intensity, but I just wanted to give a -- I thought that was a pretty striking statistics. When we are in front of the customer they grow faster. And so I just wanted to give a ballpark on that with that number. And as I mentioned, even with our current sales model, which by the way is going to have 60% more calls in the model, we were able to get the vast majority of the customers in the first half of the year. And by the way those are direct calls. Those don't include our insight sales people calling on customers. So that group can also be very effective in highlighting the customer's new product opportunities and such. And of course, that group is going to be growing substantially as part of this expansion. Operator : And we'll go to line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity : In your prepared remarks you commented that the Catalyst One placements in global geographies trended well. Could you comment on how they did in the United States? And maybe try to frame what percentage of Catalyst placements for next year might be Catalyst One? Jonathan Ayers : Just to clarify, we have two products. We the Catalyst Dx and we have the Catalyst One introductory offer, which we only offered in the U.S. And that introductory offer is an anticipation of the launch of Catalyst One, a lower cost, but fully functional analyzer, in October. So, obviously, very good growth internationally with the premium analyzer, the Catalyst Dx. But the vast majority of the revenues are very strong growth in the U.S. And let's say up 37%, Brian can correct me if I'm off by a couple of percent, in the U.S., and also very strong growth in hematology. Our Veterinary Diagnostic Consultant sales model did very, very well in the second quarter. I think it's a combination of the maturation of that model combined with Catalyst One. It's really resonating with customers. And let's recognize, we don't even have the analyzer yet and we're selling it. I mean this is amazing. We don't even have analyzer. We're giving them the Dx, as an interim, until they get the Catalyst One. So we see the opportunity for Catalyst One in the North America market as a pretty significant opportunity going forward. I suspect we will move to virtually all of our placements being Catalyst One. We'll have a small number of Catalyst Dx, but all of our placements Catalyst One. And in 2015, when we launch Catalyst One internationally and that's going to be -- I can tell you, our international teams, and we had them all in here a couple of weeks ago, they are so excited about Catalyst One. Imagine how well they could do with Catalyst One just based on what they're doing with Catalyst Dx right now and the analyzer is got 40% lower entry cost and yet all the capability. And then, we're going to be launching Catalyst One internationally like we have it in U.S. now mobily-enabled. In other words, in most markets we'll be able to sell the Catalyst One, it will be a low cost analyzer and they'll be getting the results on their smartphone. I mean this is very, very innovative and totally unique to IDEXX, and part of the package of going with IDEXX in-house equipment. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity : And just a quick follow-up. Do you think there will be any changes to the compensation structure of our sales force? And can you kind of frame your confidence of hiring the new reps and maybe comment where they'll be coming out of? Jonathan Ayers : The good news is, I think, we've really refined the whole sales model, including the compensation model in the first half of this year, with the Veterinary Diagnostic Consultants we move to a territory growth sales model. So the major element of their variable compensation is the growth in that recurring revenue in their territory of diagnostics. And that's turned out to be a very successful change. Our reps like it. And all of those systems and processes are in place, as we do this expansion. We're expanding a proven model. And so we have the success of that behind us. Remind me, other part of your question? Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity : Maybe just the confidence you have in attracting the new direct reps? Jonathan Ayers : I'm going tell you what, this is an exciting industry. IDEXX is an exciting area. How many companies do you have, where you can actually call on really nice people, call veterinarians with a series of new product launches and an innovative product portfolio? We were very successful last year with the sales transformation, where we were hiring into the role that was brand new. We think this year this is going to be a relatively straightforward exercise to get very tenured reps into IDEXX. And they come from a variety or areas. Typically they come from outside animal health or occasionally they come from inside animal health. They come from serving a trauma physician or sometimes it's dental or sometimes human medical device. They come from a variety of areas, where they understand a solution orientation, they understand a consultative approach and they are familiar with medical technology. We've been very successful with that. So we really think we're just building on the track record here in our recruiting, and our recruiting expansion implied in what we've talked about today. Brian McKeon : We're running a bit over here. We'll leave time for a couple of questions, so just that the people can keep them focused. Operator : And we'll go to Erin Wilson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : It's Robert Willoughby sitting in for Erin Wilson. Jon, I guess a question for you. You mentioned the distributors not as effective in their sales effort, as your own team would be. I guess it's understandable, but you look at disclosure out by the distributors today, the economic that you are giving them on the sales of their products maybe not so high. So I guess my question would be, could you have accomplished the same types of pickups that you're looking for from a sale standpoint, if you had given a bit more economics to those suppliers? If you incentivize the kind of behavior you're looking at, and then you could forego some of these expenditures, CapEx things, that you're doing. I mean how do you balanced that? Jonathan Ayers : We've been analyzing our U.S. distribution structure for quite some time. It's something that I think you do as a good business person. And if you look at what a distributor rep does, they are not -- we are a solutions-oriented company. And a distributor has a product of thousands -- a basket of thousands of products, that all one-off products, it's very hard for them to represent any kind of detail in any of those products. And as our technology portfolio has evolved and as the reference lab pieces integrate, which is already direct, has integrated with the -- and by the way, we sell the instruments direct, so we're selling the instruments direct and then our distributors sell the consumables, right. So it's like we've been working with our distributors and trying to have them to assist us in selling instruments for a long time. What we found as we move to this new Veterinary Diagnostic Consultant, we are more and more just doing it on our own. And this is relatively unique to IDEXX, but we felt that this was the right direction to move. And I will mention there is very relatively little, with the investments that we have here, to acquire a business that's growing at 9% to 10%, $55 million, with a good margin, you know, what kind of multiple in today's environment would you put on that. You would probably put a pretty high multiple of sales on that. And yet the transition cost that we're putting here are de minimis. I mean if you think about this in the context of an acquisition, this is like the best deal you could ever have, because it's a fraction of the value of what we're acquiring. But we're not doing it for that doing, we're doing it for the strategic reason, we believe this is the right move to support the growth of the industry. Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I guess, I kind of viewed you had the best of all worlds. So you had some distributor relationships, some pretty good terms for you, maybe not the most effective, but they certainly kept a competitor at bay here. And I guess, to an earlier question that it just seems to me, you open the door and you create an incentive for that competitor to drive more sales? Brian McKeon : I think the core -- and we've been working with distribution for a long time, Rob. Very simply, distributors do not move OEM share. Manufactures move their share. Distributors can move distributor share back and forth, who's going to serve that customer supplying them the thousand different products they buy through distribution. They don't move OEM share. This has been proven. In fact, I would say that the change that we've had in the last two years where we went to one non-exclusive distributor, proved the point here that distributors do not move OEM share. Even when we moved away from -- when we moved from three exclusive distributors to two exclusive and one non-exclusive, our revenues accelerated. I think that's prima-facie evidence that distributors don't move OEM share in diagnostic, the manufacturers do. Operator : And we'll go to Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Ryan Daniels - William Blair : Guys, I want to ask one totally unrelated question to the distribution changers. Regarding the NAD announcement related to your SNAP 4Dx, can you give a little bit more color on that. I came across and wasn't quite sure what that related to? Jonathan Ayers : The NAD stands for National Advertising Division of the Better Business Bureau. We brought a challenge to the NAD with regard to the claims that were being made by VCA on their AccuPlex product, because we felt that confused -- there were confused comparisons. We appreciated that the NAD reviewed and recommended that VCA discontinue its claims that compare AccuPlex to our SNAP 4Dx product and that in particular its claims, and there were several claims that are to be discontinued. But one of them is a test to distinguish between early Lyme exposure infection between exposure and vaccination. We believe that VCA overstated the benefits of the test, as it compares with 4Dx. And I think that the bottomline is we take a very robust approach to product development, we involve inside people, we do involve outside people, we have a number of -- we do peer review studies. In fact, Ryan, I would point you to a recently published peer review article in The International Journal of Applied Research in Veterinary Medicine that compares 4Dx Plus to AccuPlex. And I think there were over 400 observations in the study. The study concluded that there were clinically significant differences between SNAP 4Dx Plus and AccuPlex. The 4Dx Plus has significantly better sensitivity and specificity with fewer false positives and a better test-to-test reproducibility. I think the bottomline is we put a tremendous amount of science to insure clinical efficacy. This is so important to the franchise. And we back that up. We don't ask customers just to believe us. We back that up with third-party peer reviewed study, including the one that we just mentioned here. We can send you the link, Ryan, if you want. But we're certainly pleased that the NAD ruled that VCA needed to change their advertising. And my understanding is that they're going to be doing that. Operator : And at this time, I'll turn the call back to Jon. Jonathan Ayers : Thank you all for the call, for the interest in IDEXX again. It was a really strong quarter. We have seen accelerating growth across the company over the last several quarters. And then we were announcing, I think it's a very exciting clear next step in our strategy to bring, to increase the relevance of veterinary medicine to pet owners through the diagnostic category, which is such a central category. We have a very strong innovative portfolio. And bringing new effective resources, direct resources to the market that we're doing with this go-direct in 2015, we think we'll service well for a long-term growth, as we have detailed in this call, long-term growth, organic growth in revenues and an attractive profitability. Just come back to the point that I think one of you had asked about, do we see operating leverage in future years with this model on the direct piece? And very much we do. We talked about the 2015 to 2016, but we see operating leverage being achieved over time. But I think the key thing is what it will do to help us achieve our goal of sustained double-digit revenue or a long-term goal of sustained double-digit revenue growth. So with that, we really appreciate everybody else. And a huge thanks to all the IDEXX employees that help make the quarter. We have a lot of people working on a lot of different initiatives. We've been working for the last couple of months on this go-direct, and that was extra time that people spent. Obviously, the sales organizations around the world, our R&D organizations and the work that they're doing to bring, things like Catalyst One, the SNAP Pro to the market, it takes a village and really my huge thanks to all the employees who make this such a great company. So with that we're going to conclude the call. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 10 :30 AM today running through August 1.

I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon - Chief Financial Officer : Good morning and thanks everybody for joining us today in our call. I am pleased to take you through our Q3 results and the strong momentum we continue to drive in our business. In terms of highlights from today\u2019s review, we drove 13% reported revenue growth in Q3 with strong global gains across our business lines including 12% normalized organic growth and CAG recurring organic revenues. Instrument placements were outstanding with over 30% year-on-year gains in catalyst and hematology placements in both U.S. and international markets. Adjusted EPS came in at $1.05 per share, up 24% benefiting from high revenue growth, strong profit flow-through and benefits from reduced shares outstanding. In the quarter, we repurchased nearly 2.2 million shares for $272 million bringing year-to-date repurchases to over 3.7 million shares or about 7% of shares outstanding at the beginning of 2014. Our excellent business momentum is positioning us to deliver strong 2014 and 2015 financial performance. Today, we are updating our financial guidance. We are increasing our strong underlying 2014 outlook reflecting organic revenue growth trending at the high-end of our previously raised guidance range as well as benefits from a lower effective tax rate and reduced shares outstanding. We are also updating our preliminary outlook for 2015 top line and EPS guidance with expectations for 13% to 14% organic revenue growth, including incremental revenue from distributor margin capture and strong operating profit and EPS gains. Our outlook for 2014 and 2015 absorbs the headwinds associated with the significant recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which we will discuss in more detail. Let\u2019s go through breakdown of our quarterly performance starting with a brief overview of our regional performance. Our results reflect strong growth across regions in our CAG business as well as continued solid momentum in water revenues and better than expected LPD performance. U.S. revenues were $225 million in Q3 with normalized organic growth of nearly 10%. U.S. gains were driven by 11% normalized gains in CAG diagnostic recurring levels reflecting 14% gains in reference lab and consultant service revenues, 13% gains in instrument consumable revenues and 3% growth in revenues from rapid assay kits. We continue to outpace solid underlying U.S. market growth, analysis of U.S. clinical level data for practices that we track showed patient visits were up 0.8% and practice revenue grew 4.9% in Q3. Our international growth momentum continues as well. International revenues increased 15% to $158 million in the quarter or 41% of total revenues reflecting nearly 14% organic growth. International CAG diagnostic recurring revenues increased 15% normalized with strong double digit organic gains in Europe, Asia, Australia and Latin America. Strong momentum in instrument placements in both U.S. and international markets sets the stage for continued high growth in durable CAG recurring diagnostic revenues. Global catalyst placements increased 32% year-on-year in Q3 and hematology placements also increased 32%. Year-to-date we placed over 2,100 catalysts and over 2100 premium hematology analyzers globally representing year-on-year growth of 34% and 22% respectively. While we do expect some moderation in this high growth rate in Q4 as we lap strong prior year placement levels, we are tracking well ahead of our goals for 10% to 15% placement growth this year. In the U.S. we have placed over 340 catalysts of 30% year-on-year with 60% going to competitive accounts. At the same time we placed 352 hematology analyzers, up 31% year-on-year demonstrating continued high customer interest in benefiting from the integration of IDEXX\u2019s in-house solution. Our placement results also demonstrate clear benefits from our integrated U.S. sales force structure which is being expanded significantly in support of our go direct sales approach. We look forward to building on this momentum with the first shipment of Catalyst One in November which will expand the accessible market for a highly differentiated catalyst technology. Catalyst now drives over 91% of our instrument consumable revenues in the U.S. with consistent 99% retention rate. The continued expansion of our catalyst base and uplift in testing that occurs when customers switch to catalyst supports our outlook for strong sustained growth in the U.S. recurring CAG revenues. We also continue to see high demand for our SNAP Pro Mobile Device. We placed 3,200 SNAP Pros in the quarter bringing our install base to 6,100 in just 7 months since our launch in the U.S. Internationally we also achieved impressive results with 35% and 33% gains in catalysts and hematology placements respectively. As a reminder in international markets we are placing only Catalyst Dx currently ahead of future plans for global rollout of Catalyst One in 2015. Global instrument revenue of $80 million was down about 5% organically in Q3 reflecting $2.5 million of revenue deferrals associated with the Catalyst One introductory offer as well as expansion in international markets where we are placing relatively lower AUP instruments. We continue to expect an instrument revenues growth will lag placement growth this year reflecting high placements of relatively lower priced analyzers such as Catalyst One and mix impacts from expansion in international markets. CAG recurring diagnostic revenues are revenues associated with instrument consumables and service, rapid assay test kits and lab services were $278 million in the third quarter, representing 72% of overall IDEXX revenues. As noted normalized organic revenue growth was 12% in Q3. Year-to-date gains are now over 11% supported by 10% year-to-date growth in the U.S. and 14% growth in international. An increase in U.S. distributor inventories to 3.6 weeks at the end of Q3 from 2.8 weeks at the end of Q2, combined with a decrease in distributor inventory in the prior year period increased reported growth in CAG recurring diagnostic revenues by about 2% in the quarter. The continued rapid expansion of our CAG recurring annuity in the quarter reflects robust global gains across our three modalities. Our Q3 results were supported by very strong growth in reference lab sales. Our reference lab and consulting services revenues grew 14% organically to $126 million in Q3. High growth continued in all regions around the world in part aided by an additional business day in the quarter which added about 1% for lab growth. In the U.S., we achieved volume driven 14% organic revenue gains reflecting the benefit of our integrated sales force model, test innovation and continued adoption and increased utilization of VetConnect PLUS. Instrument consumable revenues were $91 million with normalized organic growth of 15%. Growth continues to be driven by our steadily expanding installed base of over 14,000 catalysts and nearly 19,000 premium hematology analyzers and increased testing as customers upgrades were premium instruments. Revenues for rapid assay kits were $47 million in Q3. This reflects normalized organic growth of 5%. We continue to drive solid gains through increased test utilization and very high customer retention, both of which will benefit from our rapidly expanding SNAP Pro installed base. As we look forward to the balance of the year, while we expect continued strong volume growth in rapid assay, rapid assay revenue growth in Q4 will be moderated by a delay in timing from our normal annual price increases as well as timing related to our enhanced SNAP Up The Savings program. Our practice management and digital imaging systems business with revenue of $25 million in Q3 grew organically by 10% supported by continued expansion of our Pet Health Network Pro business. Our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues grew 18% in Q3, excluding exchange impacts of $30 million reflecting organic growth of 14% and benefits from the acquisition of our Brazil distributor last year. Organic revenue growth was aided in part by accelerated timing of orders in Europe, which will impact Q4 LPD results. Overall, LPD continues to grow ahead of our expectation supported by increased sales in China and high levels of testing in New Zealand related to Livestock exports. We also continue to benefit from a slower than expected ramp down in bovine programs in Western Europe, which will moderate future growth. Our water business grew 11% in Q3 to $26 million, including benefits from the acquisition of our South African distributor. Organic revenue growth for the quarter was 9% supported by solid gains across North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific, primarily reflecting benefits from new customer acquisitions. High revenue growth in Q3 and strong flow-through drove 17% year-on-year growth in operating profit, excluding transitional impacts associated with implementing the all-direct sales strategy in the U.S. and 24% growth in adjusted EPS. In Q3, we incurred about $500,000 in cost associated with the ramp up of our sales \u2013 in sales and operating resources ahead of the expanded 2015 sales model. We also incurred about $4.3 million in non-recurring project management and other one-time costs required to implement the strategy. The commentary that falls on Q3 profit drivers excludes these transitional impacts. Gross profit was up 15% slightly ahead of revenue growth. We saw benefits from reduced products and service cost reflecting volume leverage and modest increases in selling price. These positive impacts were partially offset by comparisons to higher prior year foreign exchange contract gains. Operating expenses, excluding transition impacts, grew 13% driven by increases in global commercial spending and support of accelerated revenue growth. Adjusted EPS was $1.05 for the quarter, up 24% year-on-year and $3.04 year-to-date, up 16%. Reported EPS benefited by about $0.04 per share from a non-recurring income tax benefit related to prior years. Including this benefit and transitional impacts associated with implementing the all-direct U.S. sales strategy, reported EPS was $1.03 in Q3 and $3.03 year-to-date. Free cash flow was $176 million year-to-date or 113% of net income. Our strong cash flows have enabled continued allocation of capital towards share repurchases. As noted, we repurchased nearly 2.2 million shares for about $272 million during the quarter. Year-to-date, we repurchased over 3.7 million shares for $469 million. In the quarter, we strengthened our balance sheet through the addition of $200 million in low fixed rate term date through private placements of 7, 10 and 12-year senior notes with interest rates ranging from 3.3% to 3.8%. We ended the quarter with $725 million in debt outstanding. We have significant liquidity reflecting $325 million of borrowing capacity available under our recently expanded $700 million revolving credit facility and $293 million in cash balances. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of EBITDA were 2.0 times gross and 1.2 times net of cash balances at the end of Q3. That concludes the review of our quarterly performance. Let\u2019s now turn to our outlook for full year 2014 and 2015. We would like to point that our updated outlook incorporates recent changes in FX rates. In Q3, we saw substantial strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. This has the effect of lowering reported U.S. dollar revenues and profits. Given the substantial change in rates, we estimate that this will have the effect of lowering our 2014 outlook by about $10 million in revenues, $3 million in operating profit, and $0.04 per share compared to rates that were used in developing prior guidance. For 2015, at current rates and given established hedge positions, FX will lower reported revenues by about $20 million, operating profit by $7 million, and EPS by about $0.09 per share incrementally. Despite these headwinds, we are well-positioned to deliver strong financial performance consistent with our business goals. We will begin with our baseline outlook for 2014 before transitional impacts associated with the U.S. all-direct sales strategy. We are updating our revenue outlook before expected impacts of inventory drawdown in the channel to $1.505 billion to $1.510 billion. This reflects expectations for full year organic growth of about 9.5% at the high end of our previous guidance range of 9% to 9.5%. Our revenue outlook also incorporates the $10 million of negative impact from recent FX changes. We are raising our adjusted 2014 EPS outlook, while covering the $0.04 negative share impact \u2013 the $0.04 per share negative impact relates to current FX rate changes. Our updated adjusted EPS outlook is now $3.85 to $3.90, which reflects expectations for full year operating margins of about 19.5% consistent with our prior outlook and goals. Net interest expense for 2014 is now expected to be about $14 million reflecting the recent borrowings. We now expect that one-time transitional impacts related to the drawdown of inventories related to the transition to the all-direct sales strategy in the U.S. will result in a slightly lower one-time reduction in revenue and operating profit of approximately $18 million to $23 million and $15 million to $19 million respectively in the fourth quarter. The higher end of the estimated impact range corresponds with the full estimated impact of the inventory drawdown impact. We are also refining our expectation for transition sales and operating ramp up cost to be approximately $6 million this year, reflecting the timing of new hires and continue to expect to incur $10 million to $12 million in total of other one-time cost this year with the balance of the spending expected in Q4. Incorporating these transitional impacts, we expect reported revenues of $1.482 billion to $1.492 billion and reported EPS of $3.42 to $3.54. Our outlook includes expectations for a tax rate of 29.0% excluding benefits from the non-recurring income tax item noted earlier. The lower tax rate in part reflects benefits from transition costs and drawdown impacts being reported at relatively higher U.S. tax rates. We now expect free cash flow to be about 100% to 110% of reported net income and capital investments to be about $75 million. The higher cash flow outlook as a percent of net income reflects our relatively lower capital spending projections as well as working capital benefits in 2014 from our accelerated transition to the all-direct model. Our growth momentum and strength in commercial capability is positioning us well for continued strong financial performance in 2015. Our 2015 outlook is for revenue of $1.690 billion to $1.710 billion. This reflects expectations for normalized organic growth of 13% to 14%, including expected distributor margin revenue capture of $50 million to $55 million. This outlook incorporates expectations for 9.5% to 10.5% organic growth before margin capture, including about 50 basis points of year-on-year growth benefit related to the deferred revenue changes associated with the Catalyst One launch. As noted, FX will be a material headwind in 2015 given significant recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. At current rates, FX will reduce reported revenue growth rate about 1.5%. We are on track to deliver strong profit performance reflected in projected EPS of $4.38 to $4.48 or growth of 13% to 16% compared to our midpoint 2014 adjusted EPS guidance. Note that, projected EPS absorbs a negative 2% EPS growth impact from FX changes. This outlook reflects expectations for double-digit revenue gains sustained operating margins despite negative FX impacts and $5 million to $8 million of incremental operating profit benefit from the all-direct U.S. sales strategy after funding a substantial expansion of our commercial capability. Our outlook is supported by benefits from share repurchases, given repurchase activity to-date and expectations for continued future capital allocations towards share repurchases, we expect year-on-year weighted average share count reductions of 7% to 7.5% in 2015. We have increased debt moderately in this context and anticipate additional longer term financing in early 2015, which we project will increase interest costs in 2015 to about $28 million to $30 million. The net effect of these changes will continue to be highly accretive to IDEXX. Our 2015 outlook also reflects an expected effective tax rate of 30.5%. Please note that our outlook excludes potential impacts from carryover inventory in the distributor channel in 2015. There is a potential for up to $5 million of revenue and $4 million of operating profit or about $0.05 per share EPS impact in early 2015. We aim to minimize the 2015 impact through our efforts in Q4 and we will update our success in this regard and our outlook here following year end. Thanks and I will now turn the call over Jon for his comments. Jon Ayers - Chief Executive Officer : Brian thanks. It was a phenomenal quarter with broad based growth in our global revenues. Close to 9% I might mention are recurring revenue business model. The strong growth in recurring revenues delivered strong profit growth. This performance reflects the effective combination of three key elements of company\u2019s strategy. First, a sustained focus on innovation and new product launches; second, our transformations in the commercial model; and third, highly functioning global organization. Let me provide updates and comments on each of these elements starting with innovation. IDEXX\u2019s long history of building and growing veterinary practice diagnostic utilization through innovative and complementary products and services, this generates long lasting revenue as customers increasingly value the complementary nature of our offering. This makes our offerings increasingly attractive to customers resulting in increasing customer royalty and has a multiplier effect as it grows customers\u2019 use of our entire portfolio. Developing unique tests to better diagnose disease and manage pet health is a core element of our innovation strategy. As an example in the reference lab segment of our diagnostics business we introduced the Whipworm Antigen test in early 2014. This specialized test along with our entire portfolio of unique tests that we have introduced in the reference lab is helping to generate strong volume growth particularly in the U.S. Note that almost all of the 14% U.S. reference lab growth in Q3 is volume and much of that is coming from our existing customer as they increase their adoption of our unique specialized testing solutions. In addition, we are leader in using information technology to revolutionize veterinary medicine and change the standard of care. Our VetConnect PLUS service is both an example of technology and business model innovation in this area. VetConnect PLUS, a cloud based service which we provide for free for our diagnostic customers delivers actual insights from the diagnostic data generated by both our in clinic diagnostics and reference labs including base line levels, changes and trends in graphical form. This delivers not only more meaningful clinical information but also helpful communication tool to the highly valued by pet owners. Use and adoption of VetConnect PLUS increased customer loyalty to the entire IDEXX portfolio of diagnostic solution and actually increases pet owner loyalty to the veterinary practice, which in turn helps to sustain their growth and our growth in recurring diagnostic revenue. We are increasing adoption and uses of VetConnect PLUS by expanding geographically and by continuing to add new features. VetConnect PLUS is being offering in 14 countries today and will be 16 by the end of the year. In addition, popular mobile notifications and lab results are now available on both iPhones and the android mobile devices. Globally we have over 16,000 VetConnect PLUS activations of which 12,500 are in the U.S. We also continued to advance our in-house lab integrated with our diagnostic ecosystem. Earlier this year we launched SNAP Pro our mobile device that automates the running of the test kits and adds the results instantly to VetConnect PLUS in the cloud of all of our rapid assay family. While we knew from early on that SNAP Pro brought intuitive and obvious value to the hospital operations and work flow. We now see that practice staff is keenly bringing the SNAP Pro into the exam room to show the client the result of the SNAP test on the SNAP Pro screen. The SNAP Pro screen clearly shows any positive results and also all of the negative results from our multi-analyte SNAP test including our flagship canine product SNAP 4Dx which tests for six common mosquito and tick-borne diseases. SNAP Pro provides a powerful way for the practice to show the pet owner the value of running our multi-analyte SNAP test on their bellowed pet. By showing value to the pet owner, we increased practice loyalty, compliance, visits, hospital revenue and IDEXX revenues. We have now placed over 6,700 SNAP Pros year-to-date with customers, including 600 quarter-to-date in Q4. This product has huge continued momentum. Speaking of the rapid assay business, we have been extraordinarily successful in the last month with our annual SNAP Up The Savings membership program, a marketing program which we have run annually for over a decade and well-known by our customers. We have now over 9,000 practices enrolled in the 2015 program, way ahead of any prior year at this time, which gives certain discounts on purchases of all of our SNAP kits as the program has done in prior years. We expect that by the end of the year 85% of our rapid assay customers will be 2015 SNAP enrollees, SNAP Pro or SNAPshot Dx customers, corporate accounts or some combination of the above. So, in addition to the unique value that our family of SNAP tests brings to the practices, these elements strengthen the customer value and thus retention in this segment of our recurring diagnostic revenue. Of course, we won\u2019t be done placing SNAP Pro in 2014, we project significant further placements in 2015, but no product more clearly defines IDEXX instrument innovation than Catalyst One, our next generation chemistry analyzer that we are launching this quarter. Catalyst One will prove in time to be the most successful and widely used point-of-care instrument globally. We will begin shipping Catalyst One to our new customers in North America on November 3. Now, that we have completed development and an extensive lab and field testing program. As such, we have begun taking orders for customers\u2019 delivery this quarter, an announcement that has been highly anticipated by our North American sales organization. Catalyst One brings unique value of the catalyst platform to our customers with simplicity and in a very competitive entry cost. The analyzers leaf cost can be fully funded with IDEXX rebates by running as few as one patient profile per day. This addresses the vast majority of the market particularly when measured by recurring consumable revenues. Catalyst One functionality and clinical value is completely unique in relation to competitive offerings. Let me just briefly mention four of the dimensions of uniqueness. First is test menu. Catalyst has test breadth and complete flexibility. The instrument can run a complete chemistry profile of 22 tests using whole blood in 8 minutes similar to a profile that you would send to the reference lab. The largest panel of competitive offering is only 14 tests, but it can also run 17, 15, 14, 10 or 6 test profiles as well as single individual tests. Customers appreciate this flexibility as some cases require only a single test or two and others a complete Chem 22. Catalyst One is also unique in the ability to run several highly important tests for thyroid disease, kidney disease, diabetes and therapeutic drug monitoring. Each of these tests can be run either alone or together with a profile. Without Catalyst, customers will have to send the sample to the reference lab at greater cost and longer turnaround time. Second is speed. Catalyst One is unique in being able to reliably generate chemistry results using whole blood within 8 minutes. With Catalyst One, results can easily be generated during the exam and what we call real-time care. Third is two-way integration. With all major practice management software systems, a huge benefit to staff productivity and engagement, electronic medical records and automatic charge capture as the patient information never needs to put into the analyzer. The auto-charge capture and invoicing feature alone can augment a practices\u2019 EBITDA by 2% or more. This economic value is large in relation to the cost of the analyzer and itself can pay for all of the equipment within months. I would note that this capability does take years to develop, including the requisite collaboration of development by third-party software providers. And fourth is of course, VetConnect PLUS, the cloud-based service provided at no incremental charge with instant results on your smartphone the moment the analyzer is complete. Test menu, speed, elegant integration and VetConnect PLUS, four unique elements of Catalyst all at competitive costs. However, the chemistry analyzers only part of the in-house lab, which almost always includes an analyzer for hematology. A simple biology review provides useful context here. Blood is made up of plasma and cells. The chemistry analyzer gives critical data on the contents of plasma and our hematology analyzer provides 25 parameters on the cells, red blood cells and white blood cells as well as platelets. Clinically, chemistry and hematology needs to be run together and this is exactly what veterinary practices do. The evidence, over 95% of profiles sent to the reference lab that include chemistry also include hematology and 96% of our Catalyst Dx customers in the U.S. also have one of our two advanced hematology analyzers. Customers buy chemistry and hematology together with IDEXX VetLab Station, because they work in delivering results on a patient sample. Just as you would want only one app to give you a stock\u2019s price and volume, our veterinary customers want an in-house lab that gives the patient\u2019s chemistry and hematology results in one report or mobile app. Customers also want an in-house lab, where patient information is entered only once for all the analyzers or better yet has real-time two-way integration with the practice management software and that is the role of IDEXX VetLab Station, the information hub for the in-house lab that integrates all the instruments and connects them real-time with customer practice management software. IDEXX is unique in being able to do this and IDEXX VetLab Station also connects to the internet or smart service as well as the VetConnect PLUS instant results. So, while Catalyst One is truly unique, innovative and cost effective in comparison to today\u2019s competitive offering, all these advantages that I just thrive for Catalyst One are also enjoyed by our Catalyst Dx customers today. As Brian stated, our Catalyst Dx installed base of customers account for 91% of our consumable, chemistry consumable revenues in the U.S. with certain \u2013 when certain corporate accounts, which we had historically served direct or excluded. The unique value that Catalyst brings plus IDEXX hematology to the veterinary practice explains why we have maintained consistent 99% customer retention. Okay. Moving to the commercial transformation, in the veterinary market a sustained rate of innovation must be matched by strong field sales and support organization that can bring these benefits to the practice and support their adoption and thus growth of the diagnostic category. In the U.S., we have transformed our sales organization in 2013 to an account manager model, where our customers are supported by a single veterinary diagnostic consultant representing all three diagnostic modalities that makeup our recurring diagnostic revenues. Territories have become small enough that our sales professionals can establish regular customer calling cycles. In 2013, we demonstrated a 60% increase in customer visits in this new model, with just a 15% increase in sales staff. With this model gaining maturity in 2014, we have seen consistently strong growth over the course of the year in diagnostic recurring revenue in the U.S. with Q3 coming in at 11% normalized growth. One of the key reasons for this growth is that as we are regularly calling our customers, we create awareness and education of unique new testing capabilities and workflow innovations that we offer both with our in-house instruments and our reference lab. This is one of the reasons why customers have consistently asked that we visit them more often. The result is that when we visit at subject matter experts, customers grow their use of IDEXX diagnostics faster contributing to the growth of our recurring diagnostic revenue. This is another reason why, for example, we are seeing 14% reference lab and consulting services modality growth in Q3 in the U.S. And so with this insight, we are embarking on a further expansion of direct sales and support model as we go to our fully direct sales strategy in the U.S. This allows us to shrink territories even further, with each sales professional having smaller, more concentrated geographies and thus able to visit more customers more regularly. In fact, in this new model, a VDC can visit accounts that make up 60% of his or her revenues in a week and 95% in four weeks. We have made exceptional progress in Q3 and moving to our new fully direct sales strategy in the U.S. Some milestones of note, we have hired 96% of our expanded sales and field support physicians and expect to be virtually complete by November 3, including our 174 veterinary diagnostic consultants, 22 veterinary diagnostic specialists and 23 regional managers. Second, this staffing success also includes an expanded team, 73 field support representatives for diagnostics, which we have now 100% filled. These folks, which are made up of highly experienced veterinary practice professionals, train existing customers on our steady stream of new innovation, such as our in-house lab, advanced menu, and VetConnect PLUS and they are highly appreciated by our customers. Third, we are now live with a fully staffed inside sales center consisting of 75 regionally assigned professionals. This group both receives inbound and makes outbound customer calls, helps customers with orders as product line experts and has tremendous customer reach and frequency. Fourth, we are alive with our nationwide logistics capability now providing free shipping and next day delivery to the entire continental U.S. leveraging our partnership with UPS and FedEx. And fifth, we have introduced several other elements of our direct sales and marketing strategy, such as credits for expired products and special promotions when ordering direct. Our teams involved in all these elements, the plan have done a truly phenomenal job and we are ahead of an ambitious schedule laid out just a few months ago. We are now in the position to begin to transition our customers to our fully direct sales model through the balance of Q4 and leading into 2015. The growth in our commercial capability extends beyond the U.S. Companion Animal Diagnostics part of the business as we are now operating as a highly effective global organization. As Brian enumerated, we have achieved strong growth globally in the companion animal market. In the quarter, Europe as a whole had 15% organic growth in recurring diagnostic revenue, Asia-Pacific 18% and Latin America 43%, where we benefited from our direct presence in Brazil. This momentum in our global CAG diagnostic recurring revenue is a result of significant country and region leadership additions we have made along with additional field based resources. I was in Europe last week and our international teams are highly engaged doing a great job at accelerating growth of IDEXX and leveraging the unique value of our diagnostic offering. Also, important to note that this CAG international momentum does not yet even benefit from the launch of Catalyst One slated for Q1 in major European markets. Catalyst One with its low entry cost and unique capability is going to be a significant driver of recurring revenue growth globally for years to come. Practices are generally smaller internationally, so Catalyst One\u2019s lower price point is better suited to these markets than Catalyst Dx. Our international teams can\u2019t wait to get their hands on the new analyzer and its integration with VetConnect PLUS. Our water business with 43% operating margin year-to-date and is almost 100% recurring revenue from a highly loyal customer base also is effectively in investing commercial resources for accelerated growth achieving 9% organic growth in Q3, building on 7% in Q2 and 2.5% in Q1. It\u2019s really amazing to see what this team is able to do with a little investment and by taking a fresh perspective on driving growth in this highly profitable business. Our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy business is a mix of recurring and multi-year campaign revenue. Both sides of the business did incredibly well achieving 13% organic revenue growth and performance with contributions from all regions in this global business model. Again, this team is really engaged and focused on global growth, particularly the recurring revenue portion of the business. In this call as we traditionally do, we are getting top line and bottom line guidance for the next calendar year 2015 that incorporates 13% to 14% normalized organic growth. This outlook reflects the continued output of investment R&D and innovation projected at over $100 million in 2014 and growing, a level we believe represents greater than 80% of the identifiable industry\u2019s investment in diagnostics and information technology R&D for companion animal health. Note, much of this R&D is devoted to products, services and software advancements that we have yet to announce, with some exciting additions to our lines slated for 2015 introduction. The 2015 also reflects our investment in the U.S. and global commercial expansion and the full rollout of all-direct sales strategy in the U.S. Note that it also incorporates contingency, appropriate for the risks in our business, including the all-direct sales strategy. Finally, our outlook accounts for promotional strategies to take advantage of our direct approach to drive diagnostic customers, diagnostic volumes in the sustainable, profitable recurring revenue growth and bottom line performance. So, before I open the call for questions, I just really want to thank the 6,000 IDEXXers who helped make this such an amazing quarter performance, one of the best in my 12 years at IDEXX. And so with these opening remarks, Brian and I are ready to take your questions. Cynthia? Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Please go ahead. Ryan Daniels - William Blair : Yes, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Brian, maybe I will start one with you before my follow-up. If I go back and look at kind of July and then your October update and then today, it seems like the impact you are anticipating from the all-direct sales shift has lessened over those periods, both in regards to the sales investment required and some of the revenue and operating profit hit to the inventory drawdown, can you just go into a little bit more detail how you have honed in that range and why it looks to be less than anticipated? Brian McKeon : Sure, why don\u2019t we breakout into \u2013 Don into two components. One would be the cost estimates that we had. They have \u2013 the major change there was the \u2013 on the we obviously we are making some preliminary estimates back in July and on how this would rollout on the ramp costs so the cost that we \u2013 the ongoing cost that we are putting by the sales resources, operating resources that we expect to continue, we took that estimate down for 2014 from $8 million to $6 million and that\u2019s basically just timing. It\u2019s of when the costs actually flow through. As Jon noted we are fully on track to be fully staffed. And just relative to our earlier estimates which were a big conservative we came in a bit better on that front. The second change was related to the impact of the distributor drawdown. And we had higher estimates when we first came out with our outlook there we didn\u2019t, we hadn\u2019t had the opportunity to speak to others about how to manage this. And so we estimated that the impact would largely take place in early 2015. We have been very effective at working together to move this forward, so we can have a clean transition on January 1. We did reduce the impact of the revenue and profit in part because the impacts that we estimated in 2015 would have been grossed up for the additional margin capture. So you reduce that by the 15% of margin capture by moving it into 2014 as less of a revenue offset. And just versus our last outlook we have moved it a couple of million more again just based on refinements as we are getting closer to the date. So taking a step back it was more that we had more limited information when we put out the original estimates that were bit conservative and as we were refining this it\u2019s we are able to tighten that range up a bit. Ryan Daniels - William Blair : Okay, that\u2019s perfect, very helpful color. And then as for my follow-up, I guess one for you Jon, you talked a little bit about your rapid assay initiatives both in regards to making that more of an instrument consumable with the strong placements there, but also the SNAP Up The Savings program and your corporate accounts. So can you maybe the one thing I am not as familiar with is the SNAP Up The Savings, does that actually walk consumers in for some kind of minimum purchase or is it just a very high retention vehicle because they incur more savings the more products they use just some more color on that and the retention aspects of it? Thank you. Jon Ayers : Yes. It gives them a discount when they are enrolled in the program, it gives them discounts upfront and it gives some discounts based on the volume of their purchases in the back too. So it\u2019s \u2013 it doesn\u2019t lock our customers in anything. But it\u2019s a very well appreciated program and it does give some attractive volume discounts as a \u2013 as they use SNAP products over the course of the year. Ryan Daniels - William Blair : Okay. Thanks a lot for the color and congrats on the strong performance. Jon Ayers : Thank you. Brian McKeon : Thanks Ryan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wilson with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Erin Wilson - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. Instrument placements were very strong as were consumables but was there any meaningful promotional activity that was new or just implemented in the latest quarter as opposed to what occurred in the first half of the year that had a significant impact on Catalyst One as well are you seeing the initial traction or feedback that you had hopped to see ahead of that launch, where do orders stand and how big is the market opportunity there? Jon Ayers : Yes. There was nothing indifferent about Q3 from in terms of the types of programs that we used versus the prior programs. They were all continuing focus on the Catalyst introductory offer and everything was basically a business as usual. This program has been very effective first of the year. With regard to the anticipation of Catalyst One, we only began taking orders this quarter. I do note that we actually entered with a little higher backlog of catalyst coming into the quarter than we normally do. So obviously we are in good shape and it\u2019s not a big backlog business but more units in the backlog is helpful for Q4. But I think Catalyst One really and we had a number of customers who said I love what you are talking about with catalyst but I really want to wait for the analyzer I don\u2019t want to go through the introductory offer and now we can serve those customers and they can take their Catalyst One delivery in Q4 get the tax write-off and start enjoying the benefits of catalyst technology. So we have \u2013 we do have customers who have been waiting for Catalyst One. And then of course Catalyst One is going to be very effective at both upgrading the remaining vet test customers that we have out there of which we have thousands of course. And also it\u2019s a wonderful tool to upgrade customers who are in decade old technology and want to move to the unique value of IDEXX\u2019s diagnostic solution that have competitive offerings and that\u2019s a very attractive base of customers to go after. I think Brian noted that even in Q3, 60% of our placements work to new and competitive accounts and that just shows that there are a lot of customers who are not using IDEXX today, who want to move to the new capability that we bring. Erin Wilson - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. And on the direct transition, you mentioned previously that 60% of your business are roughly that is direct already, has that moved at all ahead of the full direct initiatives or your full direct effort? Where is the metric now and has it surprised you based on kind of customer responses following recent changes from Patterson and Schein? Brian McKeon : Yes. That in Q3, our business model was the same as Q2, so the 60% roughly holds. I think we are now of course in the market and we are close to our 365 field and phone-based representatives who are representing for the diagnostic line between veterinary diagnostic consultants and the specialists and our inside folks and our field service folks. And when we have conversations with customers, we are easily able to ease any concerns they have and build enthusiasm as they become aware of the change. So, I think we are well facilitized to do that. And it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s a matter of going out there and talking to customers and I think we are fully staffed in the position to be able to do so and in fact are doing so quite effectively. Erin Wilson - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open. Jon Block - Stifel: Great, thanks and good morning guys. Maybe the first one, Brian for you and there was a lot of moving parts and a lot of helpful numbers, but just when I look at sort of the 3Q/4Q cadence and what\u2019s implied for fourth quarter, you beat by roughly something like $0.17, you raised by $0.05 for the year. I know you called out I believe roughly a nickel in FX headwind, but maybe if you can talk to the cadence in the 3Q/4Q do we just all have it wrong, because of a lot of OpEx coming on from the hiring towards the tail end? That would be on the bottom line. And then on the top line, you steadily increased the organic growth throughout 2014. Fourth quarter is an implied step down, obviously a tougher comp, but maybe if you can talk to that as well? And then I will go ahead with my follow-up. Thanks. Brian McKeon : Sure. And why don\u2019t \u2013 as you know, Jon, we provide full year guidance, not quarterly guidance, so why don\u2019t we focus on kind of what our outlook was and what our outlook is. We \u2013 as you noted, we had a very good Q3 and that is giving us confidence in taking up our organic revenue growth rate to the high end of the range and from where we were currently and our revenue number is aligned without excluding the FX adjustment. In terms of the fourth quarter, we expect that our growth is going to be in line with our full year outlook adjusting for a couple of factors. We are delaying the rapid assay price increase just to align it with our other \u2013 our practices to Jan 1 and we have this expanded SNAP Up The Savings program. Combined, those are probably going to reduce our organic growth rate by about 1 point in the fourth quarter and we do expect some moderating growth in LPD. It was extremely strong in Q3 as well, but basically, the underlying growth is consistent with our full year outlook adjusting for those factors. And we are expecting the same kind of flow-through, the same kind of flow-through on the operating profit margin. As you noted, we had some FX headwinds and had some things like benefits from the accelerated share repurchases, which help to mitigate that. I think relative to where the Street may have been I do believe our revenue number was a healthy beat to what people were expecting for us then I think that was probably the key driver in the quarter. Jon Block - Stifel: Okay, great. Very helpful. And then Jon for you, you had I guess one competitor report in front of you in a way of three competitors reporting behind you, can you just talk to what you are seeing in the field? I mean, you gave a lot of specifics on catalysts, but I guess where I am going with this is I am anticipating that we are going to hear from others their success in moving share and how they are being impactful out in the field and do you want to speak to vet test retention at all and in other words, do you think if they are citing success, it\u2019s more just a function of them placing the boxes instead of Abaxis or are you seeing any higher levels of churn within vet test even though it is only 9% of consumables ex-corporates? Thanks. Jon Ayers : Thank you. So, I think that\u2019s a good question, obviously, 91% of our consumable volumes comes from our 9,000 plus catalyst customers, where we have consistently maintained 99% loyalty that really didn\u2019t change in Q3. All those trends hold steady. By the way, the trends with the vet test, which are typically low 90s retention are \u2013 those trends haven\u2019t changed other than maybe 30 basis points impact on the consumable value of the move of one of our corporate accounts to a competitive analyzer, but that was a pretty low volume account. So, clearly, catalyst technology is very unique. A lot of vet test customers that we have been trying to convince to upgrade for a long number of years with our partners that haven\u2019t upgraded typically are smaller accounts obviously. I think we have 6,000 of them. Some of them are \u2013 let me have another analyzer in their practice too. So, that\u2019s why they are lower volumes. Now, we have Catalyst One. And Catalyst One looks and feels like an instrument that is worth upgrading to that. It\u2019s an easier decision both economically in terms of how it looks on footprint than Catalyst Dx is, but clearly, it\u2019s the \u2013 it\u2019s where we see the lower royalty is in the low volume vet test installed base at 9% of our consumable revenue. So, I think that\u2019s \u2013 I think you probably understand that\u2019s an important factor. Jon Block - Stifel: Thanks for your time guys. Operator : Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James. Your line is open. Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James : Hi, guys. Two quick ones for me. First, on the inventory in the channel in the quarter, it looks like obviously you had a couple of more \u2013 about a full week of more this quarter relative to last quarter and I would have thought that the distributors would want to kind of draw that down in anticipation of the change. So any comments of why you thought the acceleration in 3Q relative to normal trends? Jon Ayers : No, just 3.5 weeks is totally business as usual. Our inventories in the field for the last as long as I have been at IDEXX 12 years that range between 3 to 4 weeks that\u2019s right smack in the middle, I think the two-way it was just a low number happen to be how the days fell at the end of the quarter. I think it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s what the distributors typically need in order to fill their warehouses across the country and serve customers. Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then secondly on the international growth, another very strong quarter there and I am just trying to get a sense of how you thought about Catalyst One internationally and what that could do from maybe a top line perspective over the coming years as you better penetrate the much bigger international opportunity versus the U.S.? Thanks. Jon Ayers : Yes. Catalyst One was as much designed for the international market as was the U.S. market, because it\u2019s really got all the functionality Catalyst Dx, but it\u2019s 40% less cost and a smaller footprint actually has incremental functionality, if you consider VetConnect PLUS and the addition of the T4 tests. So, our international teams we are very, very excited about Catalyst One, but they have been gearing up. That\u2019s why we have increased our investments in our international operations and we were now direct in most European countries in South Africa and Brazil and we geared up our capability in some of the Asia-Pacific country and we are going to be launching Catalyst One in virtually every market in 2015 with the exception of Japan, where there is a regulatory approval required. It takes a little longer in Japan, but we have got a great offering in Japan with Catalyst Dx. And the Japanese really appreciate ProCyte as a hematology analyzer. So, I think we are in a \u2013 just in a phenomenal position to grow the recurring diagnostic revenues internationally for years to come. Obviously, we have got a lot more vet test upgrade and a lot of Greenfield accounts. We have a much more fragmented competitive scenario. It\u2019s kind of country by country and we are growing the lab business. I didn\u2019t mention it, but our lab operations in Europe did very well in the third quarter. The Leipzig lab is really becoming a very effective tool, a twin lab business, because we are able to provide far superior turnaround time next morning which is really unheard of in the markets that we are serving with that lab previous to it\u2019s introduction and that works in conjunction with Catalyst One. These are trying to work together to buildup integrated diagnostic offering much in the same that we have done in the U.S. So we are very, very excited about the global market and it\u2019s not really dependent on economies obviously with 15% organic growth in Q3 in Europe we didn\u2019t get any help from the economy in that regard, but these are attractive markets for us. Nicholas Jansen - Raymond James : Thanks for the color. Nice job guys. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we will go the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess just starting off wanted to ask about the delay in the price increases, Brian I think you made a comment about that, could you give us a little bit more clarity why you decided to lay that price increase and I have got a follow-up on that? Jon Ayers : Thanks for that question. We actually made that decision about a year ago. Our price increase \u2013 last price increase was September of 2013, but the industry standard is January. And what happens is all the suppliers increase their prices to the veterinary practices in January. And what practices do is they go update all of their systems, one. And so when you have a price increase that is not timed with that, it\u2019s an inconvenience to the customer. So what we decided about a year ago is that we would go 15 months without price increase, so we can move it to January which is an industry norm and also the norm for where we had already moved the vet lab consumables. So we would be consistent with ourselves and with industry norm. Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray : And that makes sense. Thanks Jon. And then just could you give us a little bit of color as to what type of increases you typically push through and what this move to the direct sales model and maybe more competitive landscape do you think that changes the pricing power in the industry overall? Jon Ayers : Yes, these are typically a very standard normal price increases of \u2013 in some cases 3% or 4% and in some cases less, but not more and they are just ordinary as we are taking customers through the change through direct model. I think they are totally comfortable. We are able to address any concerns that they might have with regard to pricing. And those are \u2013 we are well facilitized and plan to have those conversations and the conversations that we have been having to-date are universally successful. Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity : Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe could you provide a little bit of color around strong growth in Europe, it looks like probably your strongest quarter I have ever seen and if you could comment on the trajectory of that growth as we paced out into \u201915 and beyond? Jon Ayers : Yes. Thank you. It really was a great quarter. I think we have a great management team there. Michael Williams moved over there two years ago with really broad understanding of the diagnostic business. And we actually have very long tenure country managers but I think we added some supporting personnel. We hired \u2013 we actually hired Head of Abbott Diagnostics European business. Who is now running that business and she joined in June and she has been just a phenomenal addition and we have added other capabilities. But I think the other thing is that the products and services have gotten better. We have \u2013 both our hematology and our chemistry offering they know how to sell them. Of course our lab business is really starting to grow nicely across the major countries. We have that 15% growth obviously is a portfolio of countries some of which are growing higher than that. We had obviously higher growth in the Nordics by the way. We already lapped going direct there and which we did at the beginning of 2013. So this is \u2013 that\u2019s positive. But we had in excess of 20% - 15% growth in Germany and Italy and Spain of all places. So it\u2019s a broad based capability people love their pets in Europe and I think we are particularly well positioned both commercially in terms of our product line. Brian McKeon : And I would just add Mark I think that 15% growth is certainly what we hope we can achieve on a sustainable basis in Europe over time which I think is incredible given the economic backdrop. I would highlight, there were some things in Q3 that benefited us. The prior year was floods in Germany and there were some softer performance that benefited the growth a bit, but it\u2019s\u2026. Jon Ayers : There are always things like, when does the Easter fall or weather good or weather bad in Europe that can affect it. But as Brain said, that\u2019s a good number to go for going forward. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity : Great. And just as a follow-up, you commented on the reference lab, but I think that probably beats most of street models, so can you comment on first of all you didn\u2019t provide revenue guidance by segments. So, at what level do you think the reference lab can grow and if you can comment on the variability through the quarter that would be helpful? Jon Ayers : Yes. We don\u2019t run it by segment, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t comment and give guidance. But we are talking about we believe in growing recurring diagnostic revenues. And when we do that, we actually free ourselves to think about all the opportunities that can grow the whole. So, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t actually give guidance that\u2019s not the way we think about the business anymore it\u2019s an integrated offering. But clearly, lab modality is doing well. I think it\u2019s doing well because of our specialty test portfolio in North America. And combined with the fact that we are calling on our existing customer, this is the change in the business model last year. Prior to last year, we had laboratory diagnostic consultants basically we are only calling on potential customers, not existing customers. Now, we are routinely calling on our existing customers. And when we call on them, they are actually adopting that long list of specialty portfolio that we have launched over several years, but which we didn\u2019t have brought adoption because we just didn\u2019t have that commercial channel. So, that \u2013 and then, we are just, we are investing in labs all around the world and improving the service levels. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the global sales. Brian McKeon : And Mark, I would point out, we did provide guidance on recurring CAG diagnostic revenue growth this year, 9% to 11% and we are trending slightly above the high end of that and that\u2019s giving us the confidence throughout the year to raise our guidance ranges through revenue growth and as well going into 2015, given that\u2019s a very durable revenue stream giving us confidence for the high growth rates we are projecting next year. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity : Great. Jon Ayers : Lab is a significant contributing factor as you know. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity : Yes. Thanks. Nice quarter. Jon Ayers : Thank you. Brian McKeon : Thanks Mark. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Haynor with Feltl and Company. Your line is open. Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company : Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the questions. I was just wondering, how many pent-up Catalyst One placements are to go out in the next week and a half when you start placing those things, are most of those accounts that have committed to it, already having the Catalyst Dx in the practice already or are there some that have committed to that? Jon Ayers : No, our Catalyst One is not \u2013 all of our placements in Catalyst One in Q4 will be the new customers. They won\u2019t be just to upgrading the introductory offer customers who \u2013 that will happen in 2015. So and just a background here, we went to introductory offer at the beginning of 2014 and said well we\u2019ll sell you Catalyst One, but we will loan you Catalyst Dx until for a year until you get to Catalyst One. So, the year doesn\u2019t start until 2015. So, those Catalyst Ones are to customers who have vet tests or competitive analyzers. And, it\u2019s hard to quantify because we weren\u2019t really taking orders for Catalyst One direct placements until this quarter. Ben Haynor - Feltl and Company : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, one other thing is, we are hearing in our survey is that about a quarter of practices are concerned about the volume discounts that they receive from their distributor now that IDEXX has gone direct, is there a plan to address that whether its discounts on consumables or some other promotion or do you just not worry about those people and think they will get over their concern? Jon Ayers : No, we are not surprised that you are hearing that. We absolutely have a plan and it\u2019s in all regards that you say. And the conversations we had with customers when we take them through it, they are absolutely fine. And so, we just need to take customers through it. We have 365 people who can do that. And we are very confident that we had different creative ways including some standard promotions that we are introducing in our direct model for the business that starts program as well as on the Vet Lab side, which I think will \u2013 which are proving to be quite satisfactory to customers as we have those conversations. Brian McKeon : And that\u2019s all factored in our financial outlook. Jon Ayers : All of those our promotions, everything are factored into our financial outlook. As well as contingency, we have recognized that perhaps on the vet test and small base that will have some customers that we don\u2019t reach with Catalyst One and we will make the unfortunate decision to invest in a decade old technology that doesn\u2019t have that capability. And so, we have really \u2013 we have factored all of that into our guidance. We are running a bit over. So, we will take one more and close. Operator : And that will come from the line of Erin Wilson with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Erin Wilson - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks so much. Apologies if I missed this, but as far as incremental invested capital associated with the direct transition goes, the original guidance was $15 million to $20 million, has that number changed at all? And is it all in 2014 or \u201815? And Jon, you continue to mention innovation on the IT front going into 2015, can you give us a sense of what\u2019s the next step there? Is it focused more broadly on expanding Cornerstone utilization or some other sort of capability, any sort of details there would be great? Thank you. Brian McKeon : On your first question, it\u2019s the same estimate, Erin and it will be in 2015. Jon Ayers : Okay. Yes, on the IT innovation, obviously we are continuing to add capability to the ecosystem whether it\u2019s VetConnect PLUS or Pet Health Network Pro, Cornerstone you have mentioned or that\u2019s not our only practice management software, but certainly practice management softwares are core to that ecosystem, plus we have other areas that we are investing in that are all really generated to help grow the practice and increase their relevant pet owners. We find as practices invest and particularly our cloud-based \u2013 newer cloud-based technology such as VetConnect PLUS and Pet Health Network Pro combined with their practice management software in many of the cases it\u2019s IDEXX, but not always. They can grow their practice. They are reaching out to customer before during and after the visit. They are earning into new kinds of business models. And this really is a roadmap I think for the profession, roadmap not only we ourselves, but in conjunction with the American Animal Hospital Association and AVMA, American Veterinary Medical Association really is how practices can effectively operate in the future and have strong growth in the current environment. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments. Jon Ayers - Chief Executive Officer : We just want to thank everybody for being on the call. And again, just a huge note of thanks and gratitude to the IDEXX customers who have really worked hard in many ways, including of course the IDEXX all-direct strategy in the U.S., but around the world to achieve just a phenomenal Q3. I am so proud of everybody and we look forward to updating investors on our results for the full year in January. Thank you. Operator : Thank you.

We do appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue, and if time permits, we will be more than happy to take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Good morning. I am pleased to take you through the solid progress we achieved in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2014 that has us well positioned for continued strong performance in 2015. In reviewing our financial results today, we'll focus on our underlying operating trends excluding transitional impacts in Q3 and Q4, 2014, related to the move towards the all-direct sales and distribution model in the U.S. These impacts reduce full year revenues by $25 million, operating profit by $35 million and EPS by $0.45 consistent with our prior guidance range. With the majority of these effects reflected in the fourth quarter performance.  We had a solid finish in 2014. Highlights included 9% normalized organic growth in Q4 supported by 11.5% normalized CAG recurring growth. We saw continued robust trends in recurring revenue growth globally driven by strong double digit growth in instrument consumables and Reference Lab volume. We finished the year with 10% normalized organic growth supported by overall 11% full year growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. Reported revenue growth was negatively impacted by about 3% in Q4 related to the strengthening of the US dollar. Despite these impacts we delivered strong profit performance. We achieved full year adjusted EPS of $3.99 including $6.50 per share benefit from the extension of the US Federal R&D tax credit. This represents growth of 15% or 18% adjusted for currency impacts. EPS gains reflected accelerated revenue growth, modest operating margin gains and benefits from our accelerated capital allocation towards share repurchases, which resulted in a 6% year-on-year reduction in average share count. Finally, we effectively manage our transition to an all-direct model in the US reducing channel inventory to immaterial levels at yearend. Today, we'll take you through our 2015 outlook. Of note, we are raising our normalized organic growth guidance to 13.5% to 14.5% reflecting strong continued momentum in our business. This benefit will mitigate the significant recent strengthening of the US dollar. The net result is the change to our 2015 EPS guidance to $4.33 to $4.43 per share. As we provide guidance today consistent with our approach last year, we'll focus on our outlook for combined recurring CAG diagnostic revenue growth with more directional information provided for growth by CAG modality. This is aligned with significant steps we have taken to integrate our go to market approach across modalities to support veterinary care and customer development. Let's begin with review of our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results, beginning with an overview of regional performance. We achieved strong organic growth across regions for the fourth quarter, driven by CAG as well as solid continued gains in LPD and Water. This is positioning us well for continued strong growth across global markets in 2015. US revenues were $191 million in the quarter, driven by normalized CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth of 10% supported by 13% volume driven growth in Reference Lab revenues and 14% growth in vet lab consumables. Approximately 1% of recurring CAG diagnostic growth benefit came from accelerated go direct margin capture which offset expected effects from the later timing of the annual rapid SA price increases and our enhanced snap up the savings program. Increases in deferred revenues associated with instrument sales including the final two months of our Catalyst One introductory offer constrained overall US normalized organic revenue growth for the quarter to 7%. These placement and associated deferred revenues will benefit future IDEXX's financial performance as these revenues are realized. IDEXX's performances continue to outpace continued solid US market growth. In Q4, patient visit increased 2% and clinic revenues increased 6.1% compared to the prior year period. Our data is from a broaden dataset of 5,100 clinics. Our comparable customer dataset in Q3 show patient visit and clinic revenue growth of 1.8% and 5.8% respectively. For the full year US revenues were $849 million. We achieved accelerated US CAG normalized organic growth of 9% in 2014 driven by 10% normalized CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains. International revenues in the fourth quarter were $161 million supported by 12% normalized organic growth. Normalized CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 14% in international markets in Q4, reflecting continued strong gains across regions. Full year international revenues reached $637 million, up 11% organically. For 2014, international normalized CAG diagnostic recurring revenues increased 14%, reflecting 13% gains in Europe, 19% gain in Asia Pacific and 24% gains in Latin America. We see accelerated growth in both the US and international in 2014 and we are well positioned to build on our strong global momentum this year. Strong momentum in instrument placements in both U.S. and international markets sets the stage for continued high growth in CAG recurring diagnostic revenues. Global catalyst placements increased 90% year-on-year in Q4 and premium hematology placements increased 23%. For the full year, we placed over 3,100 catalysts and over 3,200 premium Hematology Analyzers globally representing growth of 29% and 22% respectively well ahead of our goals.  Global instrument revenue of $24 million was down 9% organically year-on-year in Q4. Lower recorded revenues reflected mix impacts from high growth and relatively lower average unit price instrument globally and higher levels of deferred revenue deals. In the US, we placed 450 catalysts of 9% year-on-year with an estimated 54% going to competitive and new accounts. This caps full year effort will replace over 1,600 catalysts in the US, up 20% increasing our overall installed base to nearly 10,000. At the same time we placed 489 premium Hematology Analyzers of 18% year-on-year in Q4 and 23% for the full year, demonstrating continued high customer interest and benefiting from the integration of IDEXX's in house solutions.  We also continued achieve impressive placement result in the international markets. Total catalysts in premium hematology placements were up 28% in Q4 and 30% for the full year with total international premium placements exceeding US levels. We are building on this momentum with the launch of Catalysts One in Europe this month and rollout to Asia Pacific and Latin America in Q2. Gains in international markets augmented strong US momentum resulting in a 20% increase in our total catalysts in premium Hematology Analyzer stall base in 2014.  Strong instrument placements are driving continued high growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. Revenues associated with instrument consumables and service rapid assay test kits and labs services were $235 million in the fourth quarter. The transition to the all direct model resulted in a one time impact the CAG diagnostic recurring revenues of $25 million related to the elimination in channel inventory. As noted organic growth normalized for these impacts was 11.5% in Q4 bringing full year gains to over 11%. Overall CAG diagnostic recurring revenues reached $1.05 billion in 2014, or 71% of total IDEXX's revenue.  Looking ahead to 2015, we are targeting global growth and catalysts placements of 20% to $25% supported by the international launch of Catalyst One and premium Hematology placement growth of 10% compared to very strong placement levels in 2014. The continued expansion of our global instrument base and uplift in testing that occurs and customers switch to catalyst, supports our outlook for 15.5% to 16.5% normalized organic growth in global CAG diagnostic recurring revenues in 2015 including about 5% of growth benefit from US margin capture.  Our CAG recurring annuity growth reflects continued strong gains in Reference Lab services and instrument consumables. Our Reference Laboratory consulting services modality with revenues of $119 million grew organically 13% in the fourth quarter. High growth continues to cross all our major regions. In the US, we achieved volume driven 13% organic revenue growth reflecting the benefits of our integrated sales force model, test innovation and continued adoption and increase utilization of VetConnect PLUS. For the full year global Reference Lab laboratory and consulting services grew 12% organically. For 2015, we expect to sustain double digit volume driven organic growth for lab revenues globally as we leverage our expanded commercial capability and benefits from our test menu expansion including SDMA. Instrument consumable revenues were $77 million in Q4, grew 15% organically, and were normalized for changes in US distributor inventory levels. Including less than 2% growth benefit from accelerated US margin capture. Including one time distributor inventory reduction associated with the US go direct implementation, organic revenues declines 3%. Full year normalized organic consumer growth was 15% including less than 1% benefit from accelerated margin capture. Strong continued growth reflects our expanding base of premium instrument placements in the US and international markets and continue to high retention rates. Global growth in our active catalyst customer base which reached over 15,000 analyzers this year is a key driver of our growth momentum. Catalyst customers now account for about 92% of our US chemistry consumable revenue exclusive of corporate accounts. For 2015, we are planning for continued strong double digit volume driven base growth in consumable revenues with an additional $30 million or about 9% of our growth benefit from US margin capture.  We also drove solid momentum in our rapid assay modality this year. For the year rapid assay revenues grew organically 6% adjusted for changes and distributor inventory levels. Our fourth quarter rapid assay revenue was $26 million, reflected normalized organic growth of 2% including about 1% growth benefit associated with accelerated margin capture. As expected Q4 growth was relatively lower reflected delay timing of our annual price increase to align with January industry norm and impacts from our enhanced SNAP Up The Savings royalty program. For 2015, we are targeting low to mid single digit normalized organic revenue growth in rapid assay with an additional $20 million or about 13% growth benefit projected from US margin capture. Our customer information management and digital imaging systems business with revenues of $29 million in Q4 grew organically by 5% in the quarter to year full year growth of 12%.Fourth quarter organic growth was supported by solid growth in practice management revenues and benefits from the continued ramp of Pet Health Network Pro which reached over 1,400 users, a 50% plus increase this year.  Strong digital instrument placement growth in Q4 contributed 13% overall placement growth for 2014. A higher percentage of our digital placement was integrated with multiyear diagnostic volume commitment resulting in higher levels of deferred instrument revenue which constrained Q4 reported revenue gains. We are entering 2015 with a healthy backlog and good commercial momentum and we are projecting about 15% plus organic revenue growth next year for practice management and digital imaging systems. Our livestock, poultry and dairy business revenue grew nearly 10% organically in Q4 to $34 million. Quarterly results benefit from stronger volumes of bovine products globally as well as solid gains across dairy, swine and poultry diagnostics. For the full year our LPD revenues grew 9% organically and 12% overall to $127 million. For 2015, we are planning for relatively flat growth in LPD. We continue to anticipate reduction in BSE and other bovine testing related to the success of eradication programs in Europe. These impacts will be offset by global growth in new products including worldwide growth in dairy pregnancy testing and swine testing in Asia and Eastern Europe. Our water business revenue also grew nearly 10% organically in the fourth quarter to $23 million, driven by new business gains across the US, Europe, Asia and Latin America. For the full year 2014, water business grew 7% organically. We are targeting mid to high single digit revenue growth for water in 2015 supported by our expanded commercial capability. Solid Q4 growth and flow through supported delivery of full year EPS results to the high end of our guidance range. With additional EPS benefits from the lower effective tax rate including extension of the US Federal R&D test credit for 2014. In Q4, we are pleased to have reduced US channel inventory to immaterial levels and advance of our transition to an all direct sales and distribution model. This resulted in a one time revenue reduction of 25% with an associated negative one time operating profit impact of $21 million. We incurred $4.6 million in net operating profit impact in Q4 and $5 million in 2014 associated with the ramp up of sales and operating resources ahead of the expand in 2015 all direct sales and product distribution model in the US. We also incurred about $5 million in non-recurring project management another one time cost in Q4 and $9.5 million in 2014 required to implement the transition to the all direct sales and product distribution strategy in the US. These impacts combined reduced Q4 EPS by $0.41 per share and 2014 EPS by $0.45 in line with our expectations.  The commentary that follows focuses on Q4 and full year profit drivers that exclude these transitional impacts. Gross profit was $182 million in Q4, down 3% on a reported basis. Adjusted for transitional impact associated with the US all direct transition, we estimate gross margin to increase moderately year-over-year reflecting lower product cost and modest net price increases. Operating expenses increased 16% in Q4 or 8% excluding about $10 million in transition impacts driven by increases in global commercial spending in support of accelerated revenue growth. Reported operating profit for Q4 was $35 million, net of above $31 million of transitional impacts. For the full year 2014, operating profit was $260 million. Adjusting for transitional impacts of about $35 million, we estimate that full year 2014 operating margins were about 19.6%, up 20 basis points versus the prior year.  Adjusted EPS was $0.95 for the quarter, up 16% year-on-year and $3.99 for 2014, up 15%. Result benefited in part from favorable impact in our tax rate including $6.50 per share benefit from the extension of the US R&D tax credit, all which was reflected in Q4 adjusted EPS. Reported EPS in 2014 benefited by about $0.04 per share from a non-recurring income tax benefit related to prior years. Including this benefit and transitional impact associated with implementing the all direct US sales strategy, reported EPS was $0.54 in Q4 and $3.58 for 2014. Free cash flow was $191 million for 2014, or 105% of net income. Our strong cash flows have enabled continued allocation of capital to our share repurchases. We repurchased over 1.1 million shares for about $149 million during the quarter on average price of $132 per share. In 2014, we repurchased almost 4.9 million shares or over a 9% of our diluted shares outstanding at the beginning of 2014 for $618 million.  We ended 2014 with about $900 million debt outstanding. At yearend, we had $323 million in cash balances and about $150 million of borrowing capacity available under our expanded $700 million revolving credit facility. Prior to benefits from our plan a $150 million of new term debt issuances to be funded in February. Our leverage ratios as a multiple EBITDA adjusted to exclude transition impacts associated with all direct change were 2.43x gross and 1.56x net of cash balances at yearend. That concludes our review of 2014 financial performance. As we look forward to 2015, we need to adjust our outlook to reflect a significant continuing strengthening of the US dollar we've seen over the last three months. Since we provided preliminary guidance in October earnings call, the US dollar is appreciated about 10% against the major currencies. At the exchange rate shown in our press release, we now estimate that effects from the strengthening of the US dollar will reduce year-on-year growth by about 5% and adjusted EPS by an estimated $0.22 per share. This has the effect of reducing our 2015 revenue outlook by about $55 million and EPS by $0.13 per share, more than we had estimated when we provided preliminary guidance last October. Please note that our 2015 profit outlook benefits from about $21 million in pretax foreign currency hedge gains from previously established contracts which will mitigate the 2015 profit impacts from the stronger dollar. At current rate and timing of hedge contracts we'll lap these benefits in 2016. As a sensitivity a 1% change in the dollar from rates assumed in our press release, would impact 2015 revenues by about $5.3 million and 2015 operating profit by about $900,000 net of hedge positions currently in place.  Adjusting for current FX rates we are now projecting 2015 revenues of $1.64 billion to $1.66 billion or reported revenue growth of 10% to 12%. Our revenue growth outlook reflects raised expectations for 13.5% to 14.5% normalized organic revenue growth including about 3.5% of growth benefit from US margin capture. Our higher revenue growth outlook mitigates the negative impacts from FX changes resulting in a net $0.05 reduction in our 2015 outlook to $4.33 to $4.43 per share. A key driver of our growth plan is our expectation for 15.5% to 16.5% normalized growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues including about 5% growth benefit from margin capture.  For 2015, we estimated that CAG diagnostic recurring revenues will grow to about 72% of the company's total revenues. We expect our recurring revenue gains will continue to be primarily volume driven with expectations for a continued modest 1% net price increase in the US consistent with general levels of inflation. We continue to target flat comparable operating margins in 2015 despite headwinds from foreign currency changes. Moderate gains in gross margin will offset operating expense increases associated with expanded commercial capability including resources added to support the US all direct sales strategy. Our EPS outlook is supported by benefits from share repurchases. Given share repurchase activities to date and expectations for continued future capital allocation towards share repurchases, we expect year-on-year weighted average share count reduction of about 6.5% to 7% in 2015. This is slightly lower than our earlier estimate reflecting recent increases in our stock price. In support of higher share repurchases with increased debt moderately and we will fund $150 million of term debt in Q1. We now project interest cost in 2015 to be about $27 million to $28 million, reflecting low rate achieved in our more recent financing. Our 2015 outlook reflects expected effective tax rate of about 30%. Please note that our 2015 tax rate outlook does not assume the further extension of the US Federal R&D tax credit. While US Federal tax policy for 2015 is an unknown, as an aside, I'd note that the R&D tax credit has been extended for 18 years in a row historically. Free cash flow is projected 90% to 100% of net income for 2015, net of effect related to the addition of about $15 million to $20 million of working capital to support the US all direct strategy. Capital expenditures are estimated at $85 million, up from $65 million in 2014, primarily due to anticipate investment in manufacturing and Reference Lab operations as well as information technology products to enhance infrastructure and business processes.  In terms of our entry rate heading into 2014, we expect Q1 normalized organic growth to be in line with our targeted full growth range. Year-on-year foreign exchange effects will be significant in Q1 resulting in 6% reduction in reported growth and over $4 million of headwinds to operating profits. These impacts combined with the year-on-year effects from the ramping of incremental commercial resources globally in 2014 will result in operating margins about 100 to 150 basis points below prior year Q1 levels and limited year-on-year reported operating profit growth in the quarter. That concludes our financial review. Let me turn the call over to Jon for his comments in our business performance and our areas of focus heading into 2015. Jon Ayers : Thank you, Brian. We finished the year with strong momentum in our business. Our business model is nearly 90% recurring revenue including the contribution of over 70% from CAG diagnostics. These revenues form an enduring profitable growth factor and we are pleased to be able to raise our organic revenue growth guidance adjusted in 2015 building on our success and accelerating growth in 2014. Our performance reflects the key elements of our company's strategy. First, a sustained focused on innovation which transforms the capabilities of our customers. Second, our new greatly expanded commercial model in the US now fully in operation. And third, a strengthened global presence supported by key investments driving strong growth in virtually all regions and lines of business. Let me provide an update on these operating strategies starting with innovation. During Q4 we started shipping our next generation flagship Catalyst One point of chemistry analyzer to the North America market. We now have over 350 of these instruments in a field and the customer feedback has been extremely positive. Catalyst One combines the unique capabilities of catalyst Dx with a smaller and even simpler instrument. And at a 40% lower cost. We are excited to offer a very competitive Catalyst One solution in 2015 to the market of well over 10,000 US veterinary practices that are not yet IDEXX in house customers. The majority of this market consists of practices using outdated competitive instruments that lack menu turnaround time. And advanced software integration that are capable of what Catalyst One. Not to mention VetConnect PLUS results on the smartphone, all at the lowest price per test.  The international market opportunity for Catalyst One is even more than twice as large as US. With the launch of Catalyst One this month in Europe, we expect to build further on the tremendous momentum achieved in 2014 with Catalyst Dx placement in our international market. Catalyst One appeals to a far broader segment of practices in this market. We are also innovating in a big way with test menu. By this summer, we will be offering SDMA, a novel kidney function test in our Reference Lab chemistry panel. This new biomarker provides an early indication of progressive and irreversible loss of kidney function. Current diagnostic method including creatinine Included in most all chemistry panel identify kidney functional loss very late in the process limiting treatment options. Even today with sub optical test parameters, screening for chronic kidney disease or CKD is well adopted by veterinarians and practice. And many pet owners also know about CKD due to the fact that one in three cats and 1 in 10 dogs will in time develop this deadly disease. While SDMA can generally be run on expensive equipment such as mass spectrometry IDEXX's proprietary innovation has been to develop low cost creation that run on standard, high throughput clinical chemistry analyzers that we use in our Reference Lab. With the same fast turnaround time as the rest of the chemistry panel. This proprietary innovation will enable us include SDMA automatically and cost effectively in every chemistry panel. Our veterinary customers are thrilled to hear that we will automatically include SDMA in all IDEXX Reference Lab chemistry panel at no incremental charge starting this summer. We will also provide a Reference Lab SDMA result without incremental charge for all of our in-house customers when they run a patient sample on their catalysts as long as they use IDEXX as their primary outside lab provider. Our ability to offer proprietary and innovative test as part of comprehensive chemistry profile with the performed in practice or at the Reference Lab creates a compelling and differentiated value proposition.  SDMA is one of the most important new diagnostic at test innovations to come to veterinary medicine half a century. Of all the reasons to run prevented care a wellness chemistry in Hematology testing, veterinarians routinely put screening for chronic kidney disease at the of the list. With SDMA we will now enable practitioners to diagnose CKD early enough to do something to slow the progression through a therapeutic diet, a drug regimen or both, keeping pets clinically healthy and adding months or years to their lives. As such we believe the adoption of SDMA will be promoted by many industry players who sell therapeutic diets and drugs for CKD. As SDMA will be a huge boost to their volumes in this already important category. We believe our strategy of automating inclusion in the chemistry panel, a move applauded by our customers at last weeks' North American Veterinary Conference will also accelerate SDMA's broad recognition as the standard of care. Note the importance of chemistry testing and the Reference Lab modality, more than half the requisitions that come to IDEXX's Reference Lab in North America include a chemistry panel and virtually all customers who use IDEXX as their primarily reference level routinely request chemistry panels.  We have yet another important IDEXX Reference Lab menu introduction to discuss today. IDEXX will introduce this spring two more exciting and proprietary innovations in an intestinal parasites screening for dogs and cats. We will be introducing new hookworm and roundworm antigen test to all fecal panels that already include the whipworm antigen test. Like whipworm antigen testing, these novel tests will find the presence of intestinal worms that current methods miss and find them earlier in the infection cycle, enabling earlier disease to diagnosis and treatment intervention. We begin -- expect to begin field trials in February for this new test and to rollout this offering across the US in the first part of Q2. Screening for intestinal parasite including whip round and hookworm is a well established part of routine preventive care. And with an addition of a low cost fecal antigen test, we will have unique offering for customers. Parasites screening with fecal testing is commonly conducted manually within the veterinary practice today using difficult and less accurate sample prep procedures combined with microscopy. We estimate that 80% of the $40 million tests conducted in the US are conducted with the microscope in practice. Assuming we can covert a quarter of the $40 million to this novel and competitively priced fecal offering over time, we can grow our Reference Lab fecal testing business over four fold to $100 million annually. We are also continuing to innovate in information technology. We continue advanced the capability and the utilization of the VetConnect PLUS globally. With the Catalyst One launched internationally, we have recently introduced VetConnect PLUS in 13 countries in Europe beyond the UK. We now stand at 17,500 activations globally with 13,200 in the US. Speaking of information technology, we were pleased last quarter to have added through acquisition a leading SaaS based practice management software and suite solution in Europe called Animana. Now like the US with cornerstone, we can offer 10 solutions to our European customers. And on an advanced SaaS platform. We are also introducing in the US a SaaS based software solution called Petley Plans that enables practices to more easily adopt monthly preventive care plan. Preventive care plan have proven to be a client centric way to expand diagnostic testing adoption with pet owners. Between VetConnect PLUS, Animana, Petley Plans and Pet Health Network Pro, our client communication offering, we now have four advanced SaaS offerings for customers to managing grow their practice. Other than VetConnect PLUS, all these offerings are subscription based. You will see over the course of 2015 a continued build up of a highly capable and uniquely integrated SaaS eco system leveraging the already broad adoption of VetConnect PLUS. This IT eco system is designed to grow the profession and in turn our recurring revenue streams in the companion animal business.  Let me provide an update on our fully direct commercial model now in operation in the US. We exit 2014 with four capabilities including the launch of our e-commerce site in December that is already receiving over 30% of our customer order value, a testament to its instant success. We've hired and trained our expanded organization service customers in 174 veterinary diagnostic consultants or VDC territory. We believe that b expanding the number of territories serving the US companion animal market and the shrinking the size of each territory, we will be able to grow our presence in veterinary practices from 25,000 sales that's realized in Q4 to at least 45,000 visits quarterly in 2015. And 84% sequential quarterly increase. We know that when we call on customers they grow faster. In fact, customers we call on in 2014 grew 13% faster than customers we did not reach for at least one in person visit. Overall, our field base front line professionals and phone base sales serving the US companion animal market is the largest in the profession at over 400. Let me give an example of how we expand the market with our direct customer present. Our US Reference Lab modality grew 13% in Q4 of 2014. Almost all of that was volume growth as price contributed less than 1%. Same customer volume that is volume from customers, who use IDEXX Reference Labs in both current quarter and the same quarter prior year, generated almost 8% of the overall volume growth for the quarter. This same customer volume growth occurred in part through the customer adoption of our advanced testing portfolio. Same customer volume growth has accelerated every quarter over the last two years since the transition of our account management model in 2013. And at the beginning it was basically nothing, so it is gone from 0% to 8% acceleration. Also during the fourth quarter we have a strong number of catalyst placements to new and competitive accounts in the US. At 54% total placement, this amounted to 250 of our 460 placements and these were to generally higher volume accounts. The rest was at test upgrade placement where typically achieve a 25% uplift in consumable revenue. We also achieved a precedent level of hematology placements that build customer loyalty and diagnostic utilization.  So even with the more limited 125 US VDC territories in Q4, we grew the active and installed based of catalyst customers. The growth in the instrument installed based in what help drive 14% growth in our vet lab consumables in Q4 net of distributor margin capture. As to our rapid assay business, we've successfully placed 8,400 snap pro mobile instruments with 6,100 customers in 2014. These customers along with snap shot the ex instrument customers now account for little over 50% of our rapid assay volume in North America. Thus we have transformed a little more than half of rapid assay business to an installed base instrument business model and with only 10 months of snap pro placement. In addition, since October of last year, we have enrolled a record 13,700 customers in the 2015 SNAP Up The Savings program or SUTS. A dramatic increase of 6,700 accounts over the prior year program. SUTS is a membership discount program which we have offers with variations in design every year for over a decade and is a recognized brand with customers. The 2015 program design provides both upfront and ends of the year discounts off list price, the latter which are earned when customers achieve a minimum purchase volume of canine and separately feline kits. Moving to our international business. It is notable that the veterinary market in developed countries have a standard of diagnostic usage is approximately a third of the US, even though pet owners lover their pets just as much. Thus we believe the growth potential internationally is even stronger than US which is why have been rapidly expanding our commercial capability in virtually all global markets. As we move into 2015, we are supported internationally with the launch of Catalyst One and VetConnect PLUS and an expanding Reference Lab network and SDMA. In addition to the investment we made to advance service level and improved cost structure of our Reference Lab internationally, we've also completed three lab acquisitions in Europe in 2014 to expand our geographic presence including Switzerland, Spain and Finland. The combination of innovation and opportunities for growth globally is showing in the numbers. In 2014 both our US and international CAG diagnostic recurring growth normalized accelerated by a little over 2% to 14% internationally and 10% in the US. We see doubling the international CAG diagnostic recurring revenues over the next five years. In summary, we enter 2015 with strong momentum and an ever expanding set of product innovations which benefits from roughly 85% of identifiable industry investment and R&D in new products in the diagnostic category. And a transformed commercial capability to bring these innovations to the veterinary practice. Underlying our outlook for strong enduring growth of our recurring revenue stream is the insight that the pet owners still today significantly underserved by the profession. Pet health care could expand by as much as three to four folds in the US alone based on standard of care and compliance level at the best and class practices are achieving with the pet loving population. And of course our menu innovations in 2015 including SDMA and fecal antigen are bringing powerful new tools to empower the veterinarians to be heroes in diagnosing disease early and providing effective treatment plans that allow pets to live longer happier life. As we conclude this report of our 2014 results, I want to express my deep appreciation for our 6000 Idexxers for their continued passion. I cannot think of a better way to have celebrated our 30 year anniversary than with such a great year.  With that we will open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Please go ahead Ryan Daniels : Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess my first one the one number that really stands out is a Reference Lab same client volume growth and how rapidly that accelerated. Do you guys have any more details or color on what's driving that? If it is -- your clients moving more their test to you, more overall testing or they are doing more of your proprietary testing. Just kind of what is that and how sustainable do you think that big organic uplift is? Jon Ayers : Yes, Ryan, thank you for the question. We believe the primary driver for that is the adoption of our unique advanced test menu that we've launched over the last virtually a decade combined with the new customer account model where our sales reps are calling existing Reference Lab customers. We believe that is clearly sustainable. It has the opportunity for upside because we had actually expanded not only the number of specialized tests in our Reference Lab of course with big launch of SDMA and now that the new fecal antigen tests but of course we are expanding the number of calls that we are going to be making on our Reference Lab customers. I will know is an important observation because the Reference Lab modality is the number one contributor to our recurring diagnostic revenues. Ryan Daniels : Okay appreciate that. Then maybe just a follow- up there as well. If we think about your R&D pipeline and what it is yield and specifically in the Reference Lab was SDMA on the way with extended fecal test, is those become I think as you mentioned kind of industry standards, do you think that will start to kind of need IDEXX laboratories from a Reference Lab standpoint because there will be demand from patients are within the communities for these and in fact you are the only one they can get them from? Jon Ayers : We believe absolutely that it is important to expand the standard of care. Let's just take SDMA. The reason why we are offering it at no additional charge in all of our reference panel is because you really shouldn't be running chemistry with creatinine and without SDMA and creatinine is in virtually every chemistry panel. So we believe this will create uplift in the standard of care that will be well appreciated by pet owners. If you talk to any multi cat owner, they probably had a cat that passed away of chronic kidney disease. So it is well appreciated and we would expect that over time pet owners will demand high standard of care. Operator : Thank you. With that we will go to the next question from Erin Wilson with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Erin Wilson : Great, thanks for taking my question. Have you seen I guess any meaningful shift in overall kind of retention rate across consumables and equipment, and surely there were some customers that were really loyal to the distributors but could you talk, speak to some of the dynamics and the feedback you are getting on the go direct strategy so far? Jon Ayers : Yes. We've seen no meaningful shift. We are pleased to have continued to expand our catalyst and install base, our active installed base in Q4. We measure the active installed base. Of course the record number of Hematology placement also continues to expand and now we are really moving into 2015 with Catalyst One which is a very competitive priced and highly capable, really uniquely capable instrument. And so I think as we move to 84% sequential growth in the number of calls that we are making on customers from Q4 to Q1 in 2015, we will see the continued business benefit of the direct model play out. Erin Wilson : Okay, great. And then thinking about VCA how much I guess of an impact towards that over the past year and I guess will be lapping that to some extent but in --I guess this brings an important point on like the quality of customers and thinking about the way you look at your book of business, book of customers here, do you have metrics around like quality of customer in terms of consumable utilization that might be an interesting metric to sort of track in light of all these shift? Jon Ayers : We do track that. We find that the larger the customer the more they appreciate our technology and all of the benefits that it brings. With regard to your question on VCA, that was really an immaterial impact and the reason is that VCA is primarily drives their diagnostic volume to the Reference Lab as you can imagine. And thus each of VCA practice is we have found a very small user of the in-house chemistry analyzer. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open. Jon Block : Thanks and good morning. Two questions. First one Jon, we had done some work, it seems like you are increasing your utilization with your current customers by your go direct strategy, seems to be resonating but maybe if you can help tease out for us, where you guys having the most impact? Are you seeing the biggest lift on explaining these specialty test at the Reference Lab, is it left in clinical consumables, is it VetConnect PLUS, where you are seeing that approach resonate across your different modalities? Jon Ayers : Thank you for the question, John. Of course we have been direct with Reference Lab modality from the beginning, I think when we move to the account manager model, we were calling on existing Reference Lab customers, and we began to see the acceleration in the same store utilization that I referenced. We have now only move to a direct model calling on our customers directly for the in-house consumable. So we are really at the beginning of that utilization trend in 2015 and we have a number of tests whether they are menu on the in-house instrument suite such as fructosamine or phenobarbital [ph] are coming shortly a T4 or snap test that are not well adopted yet by customers. They have the same adoption and utilization potential that we have seen in the Reference Lab. And so we really do see that as one of the avenues same store utilization growth and expanding the market and expanding the standard of care that will be driven by this model. As I mentioned the pet owner is really not well served yet. And I think veterinarians want to learn how to better close that gap of three to four times. And that's what our diagnostic subject matter experts, the only ones in the profession who are regularly calling on veterinary practices and help them with since diagnostic is such a key component of the practice quick care equation. Jon Block : Okay, very helpful. And the other question maybe the biggest is, I am really not kind of start a war words here but they were very big numbers from your primary competitor last night and I guess I have two questions to that. You also had big chemistry numbers, why are there so many chemistry boxes going out the door in what is largely a saturated chemistry market where 88%, 89% or 90% according to our work of the clinics out there do have an in clinic analyzer, that sort of question number one. And question number two is based on some of those numbers last night they actually place more chemistry analyzers to end users than you guys in the fourth quarter. So what are you seeing within your customer base? In other words, are you seeing some of the guys who had VetTest and just never ran volume on it or very little volume on it over the past 6 or 12 or 18 months? Are you conceding those accounts and you are willing to do that just because they might be your Reference Lab customers they were never committed to in clinic. Can you parse through some of that Jon? Thank you. Jon Ayers : Well, we believe that there are well over 10,000 accounts that are really using technology that was launched a decade ago. And if you think about what happen with IDEXX over the last decade, we launched Catalyst One, we launched ProCyte, we launched Catalyst Dx, we launched VetConnect PLUS, we've expanded the venue on catalyst platform. And so we see a great opportunity to upgrade those accounts that have outdated technology and of course to continue upgrade our vet test install base as Brian mentioned 92% of our chemistry volumes exclusive corporate account is coming from the catalyst and installed base already. That's only 8% that does represent many thousand vet test customers. So it is very large number of customers but a very small amount of our volume. What we see is the greater opportunity is the 10,000 customers out there that do not have the real time care, the advanced menu, the flexibility and the lower cost per test, let alone the connection into a full diagnostic solution that is at the current standard of care that we will establish to 2015 that include SDMA, I will mention that for accounts that use catalysts and use us as their primary Reference Lab, we will be ensuring that they can practice the current standard of care that include SDMA even when they are running their chemistry panel in-house because they will be able to include that Reference Lab SDMA at no incremental charge. So we see a very significant opportunity and that's our framework, that's our outlook for the market. We are pleased with the 14% growth that we had adjusted even for margin capture. And the instrument consumable modality and we think that's a very good number. And we expect to continue to grow the instrument modality. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Kevin Ellich : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Jon, just kind of following up on SDMA. Could you give us some color as to kind of the work you guys did to see what type adoption you should see out of the vet clinics in the market? I guess where is the demand? And then combined with your new fecal test that you talked about that will be out later, how much do you think that will boost your Reference Lab growth? Jon Ayers : Well, we expect that both those menu items will be beneficial to all of our recurring revenues even though they are both Reference Lab modalities because they are part of integrated diagnostic solution. Just to give you a little bit background. Basically the current way that you screen for chronic kidney disease, the primary parameter is creatinine The problem is that when creatinine goes up that's basically means that the kidney ran out of capacity and it is being overwhelmed by the bodies and creation of creatinine which is a metabolic waste product. So basically it is too late. 75% of the kidney is gone. So what SDMA does is it catches this progress of this disease far earlier, 40% or even 25% when the pet is clinically totally healthy. You can donate one of your kidneys if you are healthy and still live on one kidney. So 50% loss of kidney function is not a problem, but it is a problem if progresses to 75%. And then there are a number of treatments. This is a big category in the therapeutic diet area for kidney diets that preserve a kidney function. So we suspect that there going to be others that are going to be jumping on board and promoting SDMA because there will be a market which will demonstrate the need for their diets or in other cases for therapies, for drug therapies. Chronic kidney disease, there isn't any ambiguity about chronic kidney disease in the practice. You talk to any veterinarian they are going to see I see it all the time in my practice. This is a major category. We expect this will be the standard of care, that's why we decided to exclude SDMA automatically in the chemistry panel; of course we can do so with our innovation because we felt that running a panel without SDMA was really incomplete and this has been extraordinarily well accepted. Immediately, instantaneously as we informed customers of what we are doing here. There is just no-- it is all good. It actually expands the reason to do preventive care testing because they can get to it, now they are more -- they are with the higher energy to recommend preventive care testing to pet owners. Kevin Ellich : Thanks. Then my follow is with changes in the competitive landscape as Jon was talking about, how should we think about your catalyst retention rate, can you guys breakout the mix between Cat One and Dx and how will this impact your consumable revenue stream and margins going forward? Thanks. Jon Ayers : Yes. It is the practice owned to Catalyst Dx, they have all the capability of Catalyst One. So Catalyst One is really targeted at any practice that doesn't currently enjoy the benefits of catalyst technology. And so we see Catalyst One as a very competitive way to grow the catalyst and installed base. And as we've mentioned we've really seen an immaterial impact on our catalyst retention rates which is what gives confidence for continued double digit growth in this modality. Brian McKeon : Yes. I just want to reinforce that. Today, we raised our outlook for CAG recurring diagnostic revenue growth and make clear that we are expecting continued strong double digit growth in consumable revenues in 2015. So we are maintaining the very strong momentum -- accelerated momentum that we achieved this year. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will go to line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Mark Massaro : Hey, guys. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Your customer retention rates have always been quite good in the high 90s. Overall, has there been any change to the -- I think it is for 96% to 99% retention rate that you have decided? Jon Ayers : No. Mark Massaro : Okay, great. And then with respect to US catalyst placement, perhaps to competitive account, can you maybe walk us through where you see that metric going in the next couple of quarters? I know I think you have been reporting roughly 60% going to competitive account and the number came in I think around 54% this quarter, so how should we think about that metric going forward? Thank you. Jon Ayers : I think if you look at the last four quarter we had between 50% and 60% in competitive placement I saw obviously we saw big jump in the absolute number placement in Q4 and 54% is pretty solid and there is obviously as the number of vet test accounts diminishes that are out there and you got well over 10,000 competitive account, we are going to see that is attractive opportunity for the continue placement of Catalyst One. And its unique capabilities and price point. Operator : Next we will go to line of Ben Haynor with Feltl and Company. Your line is open. Ben Haynor : Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of numbers questions for you. On the tax rate I did see the $6.50 called out in the press release, but I was wondering what else alter the tax rate there. I recall the guidance on the Q3 call been for 29% tax rate for 2014 excluding the $0.04 benefit in Q3. I think that would have implied 28%, 29% in Q4. So how would you categorize the remainder of the benefit relative to the 30% rate that you have reported? Brian McKeon : We literally had five things that are smaller in nature, are all moving in the right direction in the quarter. And it is not one specific thing, they created a little bit of an upside there and get the benefit of some of those were related to planning initiatives and that's one of the reasons why lowered our outlook for the 2015 tax rate to 30%, the prior guidance has been 30.5% Ben Haynor : Okay, thanks for that. And then with your plans for share repurchases and the financial outlook, it seems you're going to continue to take on debt to repurchase shares, by my math kind of back of the envelop that would put your book value at maybe negative $5 a share existing 2015 which would be a pretty similar decline to the $7.50 a share we saw during 2014. Am I in the ballpark here and I guess at what point would you consider slowing down taking on debt to conduct share buyback? Brian McKeon : Well, we are very comfortable with the path we've been on in terms of our capital structure. As I mentioned, we are ending the year at little over 2.4x EBITDA in terms of our leverage ratios adjusted for the transitional impacts. We are very comfortable with leveraged range in the 2.5 to 3 range. We said that consistently and in terms of our capital allocation strategy we want to ensure that we are maximizing value for shareholders. And as long as we are comfortable with our business outlook which today we reinforced and raised our operating outlook. Our confidence will help us to assess how we look at allocating capital to share repurchase and we would anticipate continue to allocate capital because we feel great about our strategic plan and the deposit momentum we are driving. Jon Ayers : I also just might mention, of course that we have a pretty strong cash flow coming out of the operation of the business. And it is one of the benefits of our business model which allows us to have capital to allocate to share repurchase. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Kevin Ellich : Thanks for the follow up. Brian, just a quick question. I know there is a number of moving parts but free cash flow was only 20% of GAAP net income or$9 million this quarter just wondering what's going on there and I guess what's your outlook for free cash flow in 2015? Thanks. Brian McKeon : I would have to look at more closely; I would assume that's related to the transitional impacts. So I wouldn't look at the quarters indicative can be related to timing of capital spending and things like that. We did share that our outlook for free cash flow in 2015, it was 90% to 100% of net income and keep in mind that we got-- and we've signal this earlier we are going to add about $15 million to $20 million of working capital primarily receivables related to the go direct change which is 7% or 10% or so of net income. So it is effectively the same range that we've been around a 100% of net income or better normalized for those impacts. Jon Ayers : Thank you very much for the calls. And for joining the conference call. I just want to wrap again by really expressing my appreciation to IDEXX. We celebrated our 30th anniversary over the last 12 months, 30 years of innovation. And I just extraordinarily grateful for what we've accomplished both on the innovation front and on the global commercial front, which positions us so well for the next many years to serve our customers and to continue to transform their capabilities to achieve their objectives and in the case of, of course the companion animal business to serve the pet owner. We believe there is just very significant opportunity to both grow their capabilities to provide high standard of care. And to expand the level of standard of care that is provided both in the US and even more so in the international market. And the accomplishments that we've achieved in the 2014 have just positioned us very, very well to do that. And therefore to continue to see sustained growth in the attractive and profitable growth factor of our recurring revenue. And with that we will conclude the call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, today's conferece call will be available after 10.30 AM today until midnight February 6.

I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Good morning, everyone. Today I'll take you through our first quarter results and spend some time reviewing our updated financial outlook for the full year. Jon will follow with his comments and observations. We had a solid start to the year in Q1. In terms of highlight our first-quarter revenues were $382 million, up 6% on a reported basis. Foreign exchange was a significant headwind in Q1 resulting in a 6% year-on-year reduction in reporter growth. These changes reduced year-on-year operating profit by over $5 million or about $0.01 per share more than originally projected. Despite these impacts, we delivered EPS results of $0.98 per share on Q1, reflecting 18% year-on-year gains on a constant currency basis. Results were supported by strong organic growth and better than expected operating margins. Normalized organic revenue growth in Q1 was 11.4% and recurring CAG diagnostic gains were nearly 14%, supported by continuous strong growth in VetLab consumables and reference lab services across our U.S. and international markets. Instrument placements were very strong in the quarter. Worldwide premium placements increased 24%, reflecting 35% growth in Catalyst instruments and 13% growth in premium hematology. Globally, we achieved 925 Catalyst placements, including 425 in North America, with a significant backlog heading into Q2. While we posted high organic growth results in Q1, revenue gains fell below our raised growth expectations. Overall growth was constrained by tough weather conditions across much of the U.S. in the quarter. While consumable and reference lab sales remained strong, rapid assay results were below expectations reflecting lower sales of first-generation lines, that is, feline and single test canine products. Lower than expected revenues in our digital imaging business also moderated overall growth. Looking forward, we're recalibrating our 2015 financial outlook to reflect the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which we estimate will reduce revenue by an additional $15 million and EPS by $0.05 per share in 2015 compared to rates used to calculate our original 2015 guidance shared on our January earnings call. We're also revising our full year organic revenue growth outlook by 1.5% to 12% to 13% to reflect Q1 results, expectations for moderate organic declines before margin capture benefits in our rapid assay business and revenue impacts from a transition in our Information Management business towards an increased focus on cloud-based services. Along with FX impacts, this revised outlook will lower our 2015 EPS outlook to $4.14 to $4.24 per share this year. We'll walk through our updated guidance in more detail later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our Q1 performance. We achieved solid organic growth across our major business segments in Q1. Global CAG revenues were $325 million, reflecting 13% normalized organic growth or 9% growth excluding benefits from U.S. go-direct margin capture, driven by continued strong gains in instrument consumable and reference lab sales. Our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy business revenue grew 3% organically to $31 million, benefiting from growth in new products and overall gains in Asia-Pacific, which offset an expected moderate decline in European bovine sales. Our Water business also continued its solid gains, growing 6% organically to $22 million, reflecting continued new business inroads across major regions. Overall, U.S. revenues were $235 million in the quarter, up 13% organically, or 8% excluding margin capture benefits. U.S. gains were supported by normalized CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth of 15%, or 8% growth excluding margin capture benefits, reflecting continued high growth in instrument consumable and reference lab sales, which offset lower practice level sales and rapid assay. IDEXX's performance continues to outpace solid continued U.S. market growth, reflected in our broadened data set of 5,100 clinics. In Q1, patient visits increased 3.4% and clinic revenues increased 6.7% compared to the soft overall market results in Q1 of 2014. International revenues in the first quarter were $147 million, supported by 9% normalized organic growth. Normalized CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 11% in international markets in Q1, reflecting continued strong gains across major regions. As noted, global instrument placements were excellent in the quarter, driving 19% organic growth in instrument revenues to $20 million. U.S. premium instrument replacements increased 15% with an estimated 59% of Catalyst placements going to competitive and greenfield accounts. International premium instrument placements increased 32% supported by the European launch of Catalyst One. We also placed 291 VetTest Chemistry Analyzers in international markets, expanding our foothold in smaller clinics. Strong placement gains set a foundation for continued strong growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. Global CAG diagnostic recurring revenues were $279 million in Q1, up 14% organically, or about 9% excluding benefits from go-direct margin capture. By modality, instrument consumable revenues of $98 million grew 22% normalized in Q1 or 13% excluding margin capture benefits. We saw continued strong gains across regions. In the U.S., we're expanding our penetration of premium analyzers, including solid continued growth in our Catalyst installed base, which now drives 93% of our consumable revenues exclusive of corporate accounts. This supported continued strong growth in consumable revenues well ahead of U.S. market growth rates. Our reference laboratory and consulting services modality with revenues of $123 million grew organically 12% in the first quarter. High growth continued across all our major regions including double-digit volume driven gains in the U.S. despite weather challenges. We expect strong continued growth in lab revenues going forward as we leverage our expanded commercial capability and benefits from our test menu expansion including SDMA. Continued high growth in consumable and lab revenues help to offset softer than expected performance on a couple of fronts in Q1. Rapid assay revenues increased 6% normalized in Q1 to $44 million. Excluding benefits from U.S. margin capture, rapid assay revenues declined about 3% in the quarter. In addition to impacts from tough weather conditions in the U.S., we experienced greater revenue declines than expected in our first-generation SNAP products. These impacts offset solid volume gains in our core canine SNAP 4Dx Plus and specialty test products, which make up the majority of our rapid assay revenues. Based on our Q1 results and our assessment of these trends, we're lowering our full year 2015 outlook for rapid assay revenues by about $15 million, below our earlier projections for low to mid-single digit growth before benefits from margin capture, to reflect expectations for mid-single digit declines in rapid assay sales this year, before an estimated 11% growth benefit from margin capture. Jon will talk more about dynamics in this area in his comments. Our digital business also fell short of growth goals in Q1 as a result of both increased levels of deferred revenue deals associated with bundled business commitments and the impact of new territory alignments with our expanded diagnostic sales reps. These impacts limited overall Information Management and Digital Imaging System revenues to $26 million in the quarter, or 3% organic growth, despite solid gains in Information Systems. We're also recalibrating our full year growth outlook to reflect expectations for more moderate revenue gains in Digital Imaging this year, as well as to reflect revenue impacts related to an accelerated transition towards a subscription-based software-as-a-service model in Information Management. We expect this will result in reported IM and Digital revenue growth of 5% to 10% this year, below our earlier estimates of 15%-plus gains. Despite these pressures and additional FX headwinds, we delivered strong financial performance in the quarter. Operating profit was $73 million, up 4%. Excluding currency impacts, operating profits increased 12%. Operating margins of 19% were better than expected, primarily reflecting timing and management of operating expenses in the quarter. Gross profit was $216 million in Q1, up 7% on a reported basis. Gross profit margins increased modestly, benefited from lower product costs. Foreign exchange hedge gains reporting gross profit were $4.5 million, or $0.07 per share in Q1. Operating expenses increased 8% in Q1 reflecting planned increases in capabilities supporting the U.S. go-direct strategy and global increases in commercial spending, in part reflecting stepped-up investments advanced in the second half of 2014. EPS was $0.98 per share, up 10% on a reported basis and 18% adjusting for higher than expected currency impacts. EPS growth benefited from share repurchases advanced over the last year, which reduced average share count year-on-year by nearly 9%. In Q1, we repurchased over 859,000 shares for $134 million. We ended Q1 with $1.05 billion in debt outstanding, including $150 million of new term debt issuance funded in February. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of EBITDA adjusted to exclude transition impacts associated with the all-direct change, were 2.8 times gross and 2.0 times net of $320 million in cash and investment balances at quarter-end, in line with our long-term target range. Looking ahead, we're updating our full-year guidance today. We're adjusting our 2015 revenue guidance range to $1.60 to $1.62 billion to reflect an additional $15 million of currency headwind at current rates, and our revised outlook for 12% to 13% normalized organic revenue growth. This outlook reflects expectations for 14% to 15% normalized growth in CAG recurring diagnostic revenues. At the exchange rates shown in our press release, we now estimate that effects from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar will reduce year-on-year revenue growth by about 6% and adjusted EPS by an estimated $0.27 per share, or about $0.05 per share more than estimated at the time of our January earnings call. Please note that our 2015 profit outlook benefits from about $22 million in pre-tax foreign currency hedge gains for previously established contracts, which mitigate the 2015 profit impacts from the stronger dollar. This equates to about $0.33 per share in after-tax EPS benefit. At current rates and timing of hedge contracts, we will not have the benefit of these hedge gains in 2016. We're adjusting the 2015 EPS outlook to $4.14 to $4.24 to reflect the incremental FX impacts and the net flow-through effects of our revised organic growth outlook. On a constant currency basis, this equates to 11% to 13% growth, but above 2014 adjusted EPS levels, which included $.065 per share benefit from the extension of the R&D tax credit. With our updated outlook for FX impacts, we now expect modest year-on-year declines in full year 2015 operating margins compared to 2014 levels adjusted for transition impacts. Other elements of our FX profit outlook are basically consistent with our prior guidance, including expectations for an effective tax rate of about 30%. Please note that our 2015 tax rate outlook does not assume the further extension of the R&D tax credit. We're also updating our free cash flow outlook to 80% to 90% of net income to reflect expectations for relatively higher capital spending levels of about $100 million this year, driven in part by a capacity expansion in our labs business and in our manufacturing operations in support of business growth. For Q2, we expect reported and normalized organic revenue growth to be relatively consistent with Q1, with operating margins down 50 to 100 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting timing of spending and FX impacts. We expect our organic revenue growth rates to improve as we work through the year, reflecting the benefit of the maturation of our expanded direct commercial organization in the U.S. and the rollout of new product introductions, including our T4 addition to our Catalyst profile and the additions of SDMA and fecal antigen to our reference lab offering in the second half. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the discussion over to Jon for his comments. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay, thank you, Brian. In the first quarter of the year, we achieved strong performance across broad areas of the IDEXX portfolio. We're seeing strong market validation that our Catalyst One is the global blockbuster that we had hoped. In addition, we expect that an important group of true diagnostic innovations that have been years in the making \u2013 SDMA, T4, expanded fecal antigens and a new urine analyzer \u2013 will be introduced to the market in the next 12 months. However, we also face some new competitive headwinds this quarter in the U.S. rapid assay market that has impacted us at a time when we are perfecting our new direct sales model. Our products compete favorably with these new products in terms of test accuracy and integration; however, it is proving to take time to demonstrate these differences and reach veterinary practices with this message. I'll speak more about this later. Despite these impacts in one part of our rapid assay business, we remain on track for strong normalized organic growth of 12% to 13%, including 14% to 15% CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues growth. We had \u2013 we are well-positioned for strong sustained organic growth in quarters and years ahead. So let's talk about areas of progress supporting this momentum, starting with Catalyst One. Our 35% growth in Catalyst placements globally were helped by our international operations which achieved 66% increase in Catalyst chemistry analyzer placements. Europe placements grew over 100%. We benefited from both the launch of Catalyst One in Europe and very strong commercial performance in almost every international country. In Italy, for example, we placed an incredible 81 Catalyst analyzers in three months. And we have yet to launch Catalyst One in Asia-Pacific and Latin America geographies which will take place in Q2 and Q3. Catalyst One is proving to be the winning product for all geographies globally. We now have over 1,200 Catalyst One's in the field since the launch in Q4 and the performance of this product is virtually flawless, reflecting our deep experience in instrument development. We now have a direct in-country commercial presence for our CAG business in all major international country markets. The practice, education and reach accomplished by our well-trained and medically sophisticated sales professionals is showing signs of paying off with these outstanding early results. In the North America CAG market, we completed the transition to the expanded sales structure and new territory mapping in the U.S. Note that this involved adding 50 new sales professionals as we expanded from 125 to 175 sales territories. With these territory design changes, 9,000 out of 23,000 covered customers have a different veterinary diagnostic consultant representative than they did in Q4. While we expect these new relationships will take time to mature, we still achieved excellent gains in instrument placements and consumable growth in the U.S. while we're in the early stages of our new model. We also saw 59% of our instrument placements come from competitive and greenfield accounts in Q1, very close to a record. I expect this competitive and greenfield placement level to continue to be impressive in future quarters as new and competitive customers come to appreciate that Catalyst One is cost-effective next-generation analyzer that leapfrogs their practices, medical capabilities and economic success. We also saw strong continued reference lab growth in U.S. The expanded sales team is timely and effective in discussing the benefits of our reference lab, including our recently announced reference lab innovations \u2013 SDMA and fecal antigen \u2013 topics of keen interest to veterinarians. We also note from experience that after a realignment of territories, the field sales organization deepens relationships in their new territories and the new reps that are added to the company move through the learning curve. Our sales performance thus accelerates each quarter. Our experience with our salesforce transformation that was put in place in Q3 of 2013, saw a progression of increased performance each quarter thereafter. With a strong base of performance already in Q1 of 2015 in the first quarter of the expansion in territory alignment, we fully expect this same dynamic going forward. While overall organic growth continues to be strong, we are recalibrating our growth outlook for the rapid assay modality. As Brian mentioned, certain first-generation product lines within our rapid assay diagnostic modality faced new competition in 2015 that is impacting the overall revenue growth of this modality. These first-generation IDEXX products made up of our feline retrovirus SNAPs, canine heartworm single-line analyte SNAPs and certain smaller volume single analyte canine products have a level of differentiation, be it accuracy or integration, that is more subtle and thus a greater competitive risk as we refine our new sales model. In addition, these lines are also purchased by the vast majority of veterinary practices in the U.S., including customers where these are the only IDEXX products that they buy. Thus, we require different ways of marketing and we are learning to communicate more effectively to this broad group of customers by augmenting our field sales organization with other channels such as our inside sales professionals. Nonetheless, we are now estimating that with the new guidance that Brian gave, these first-generation products in the U.S. will now contribute approximately only $50 million to our 2015 revenues or 3% of the company total. Of course, many of our customers do appreciate the superiority of these lines, including those that have adopted SNAP Pro and its productivity and integration benefits. We believe we have correctly estimated the impact of the new competition, as the assumptions in the competitor trends for the full year 2015 are somewhat greater than the competitive impact we saw in Q1, even as we continue to refine our strategies with our new direct model. The rest of our rapid assay business remains highly differentiated and showed in the first quarter the growth we expected in volumes, revenues or both. These lines are made up of our fourth-generation canine SNAP 4Dx Plus, certain unique specialty SNAPs, and of course, our businesses outside the U.S. Note that unlike the U.S., we face competitive offerings in our international markets that are similar to the competitive offerings being introduced in the U.S. this year. While this adjustment to our growth as noted \u2013 with this adjustment \u2013 we've maintained our outlook of 12% to 13% organic growth for the year driven by broad based gains in the portfolio. This growth is supported by continuing set of important product launches, in addition to Catalyst One, coming out of our investments and innovation in R&D. So let me review with you five significant new competitive offerings that are expected to come to the market in the next 12 months. First is SDMA. As I mentioned in our January call, our next generation chemistry marker, SDMA, is the most important test innovation we have brought to the veterinary profession in the history of IDEXX, as a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease earlier in the progression of this irreversible condition than traditional parameters. Early diagnosis allows for earlier treatment. The launch of SDMA in our reference labs is now underway with the results already being provided to a couple hundred customers as part of our rollout process. The automatic inclusion into the chemistry panel for IDEXX reference lab customers in North America, well over 10,000, is now scheduled for the beginning of July. SDMA is proving to be of keen interest to veterinarians and its introduction is giving our expanded sales force of 175 U.S. veterinary diagnostic consultants, as well as those that we have in Canada, virtually unlimited access to veterinarians and decision makers. Our market research shows that perhaps 20% to 25% of reference lab costumers will consider switching labs just to gain access to SDMA and the chemistry profiles. And those that don't can still send us samples for SDMA testing at a price of $19.95 per sample. SDMA will augment IDEXX's reference lab growth and indeed our overall growth of the CAG recurring diagnostic revenues through new customer acquisition, strong retention and greater utilization. Second is fecal antigen. Next week, we will complete the launch of our expanded fecal antigen panels in our North American reference labs. Our new hookworm and roundworm antigen tests will be added to our already highly differentiated whipworm antigen offering. Our unique antigen panels catch the presence of adult worms earlier in the infection cycle than current egg detection methods, enabling faster diagnosis and treatment for pets. This innovation in fecal test will also continue to drive good growth in our reference lab mortality. Third is the T4 slide on Catalyst Dx. At the end of June, we'll be launching our already highly popular T4 slide available on Catalyst One since February, to our large Catalyst Dx installed base in North America. T4 is an important test for canines and felines and is already included by customers in over 60% of the panels that are sent to the reference lab. The T4 slide can be run conveniently with the rest of the chemistry panel on the Catalyst platform, a unique capability in in-house chemistry. Fourth is our advanced software-as-a-service practice management software. Later in Q3, we'll be launching a highly innovative SaaS-based practice information management offering in North America. We've launched a similar offering in Europe in Q4 and growth since launch has exceeded our already high expectations. We will also be launching a SaaS-based digital imaging software in Q3. A SaaS-based IT ecosystem for our customers, which of course, many are already using with VetConnect PLUS, adds a profitable subscription-based revenue stream, but importantly, supports increasing diagnostic utilization, customer retention and acquisition. Fifth, is a new analyzer, a urine sediment analyzer. In early 2016, we expect to launch a urine sediment point-of-care analyzer that is an extension to the IDEXX VetLabs suite of in-house analyzers. Virtually every practice performs urinalysis manually as part of the basic workup or the minimum \u2013 what we call the minimum database of chemistry hematology and urinalysis. This instrument system introduces an entirely novel way to perform a urine sediment review with unparalleled accuracy, staff productivity and turnaround time. We estimate that we will generate between $150 million and $200 million in profitable cumulative revenue over five years after launch and that's (26:10) between instruments and consumable revenues. The availability of this novel analyzer reinforces the value of the IDEXX integrated diagnostic offering. With SDMA, fecal antigen, T4 and Catalyst, new software-as-a-service offerings in 2015 and the new analyzer in early 2016, our innovation strategy remains in high gear. Our commercial organization, both in the U.S. and internationally, is in place and growing in capability with each passing quarter. The combination of a highly differentiated diagnostics and information technology offering and a highly effective direct global commercial organization that is representing our solutions effectively to veterinary practices gives us confidence of strong organic growth for years to come in the highly attractive market for animal health. With these comments, Brian and I are now willing to open the call up for questions. Operator : We'll go to the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Please go ahead. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and for all the information. Let may ask another one on the rapid assays. I'm curious with the first-generation products there, are you seeing actual market share losses to the volume of those products or is it just increased price competition such that you're lowering your prices to match competitors and that's impacting the growth outlook? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, it's \u2013 obviously we're responding with selective pricing strategies \u2013 and it is also impacting the volume. So really what we saw in Q1 \u2013 and just a reminder \u2013 what we've calibrated for the year is a little bit greater than what we saw in Q1 is a combination of both of those. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And you mentioned there's about $50 million in first-gen products, I'm curious how much of that is currently sold, if you have the number, outside of what you would refer to as the larger IDEXX customer. So, again, those that just use those first-gen products and no other IDEXX which may be more susceptible, if you will, to share loss? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, obviously some of our customers, larger customers, have adopted SNAP Pro. We generally have a better position with larger customers. Obviously, we're calling on the larger customers more frequently and of course, larger customers buy more diagnostic. So certainly the majority is, with the large customers, but of course there's a long tail of small-cap customers that makes up the minority of that revenue. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, one quick follow-up on the salesforce and I'll hop off, just how many quarters have you seen it in the past take to ramp to what you would consider kind of a normal run rate performance when the reps start seeing new accounts? Is that a one to two quarter phenomenon or does it last longer? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think if you go back to when we reconfigured our salesforce in 2013 and the third quarter was really the first quarter that we had that fully in place. That was, what I would call \u2013 and you can go back and look through your notes too \u2013 a good but not great quarter. The fourth quarter was a very good quarter. And then the first quarter of 2014 was an even better quarter. So, we're pleased with the base that we established with this new territory configuration and expanded sales reps in the first quarter of 2015, and we expect that every quarter, as their relationships with their calling patterns and the customers deepen, and of course our product offering continues to have new things to impress and talk about that \u2013 the productivity of that salesforce will increase like it did when we made that change in 2013. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open. Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks and good morning. I guess, I've got a follow-up on the rapid assay and then just sort of more of an overall P&L question. But to follow up on rapid assay, Jon I think you said, $50 million of the $65 million in the first generation sort of remains, that would imply that about 25% of the first generation is being lowered. But it seems like a really big number, especially when I believe the $65 million would be worldwide, so I guess what I'm trying to tease out, can you just talk to us about your confidence in call it your 4Dx or 4Dx plus business? What are you seeing there? Are you seeing any signs of churn in that particular business? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So first of all, the $50 million is just the U.S.; it doesn't include any international revenues, so just to clarify on that, on that one point. We saw good volume gains in 4Dx in the first quarter and so 4Dx remains highly differentiated. Obviously, it's got six tests. Its accuracy is unparalleled. Its convenience is unparalleled. Many of those customers are integrated with SNAP Pro. It's a little bit more concentrated customer set, a little bit more concentrated geographies. They're the ones that our reps call on. We'll be, of course, augmenting our capability there as we expand. One element of our field sales strategy which is really being put in place in second quarter, is our professional service veterinarians, the 12 regionally-based professional service veterinarians. And we've hired almost all of them now; they generally come from other animal health companies. So they know exactly what the job is \u2013 they just need to learn our part of veterinary medicine. And they're very effective in communicating the importance of vector-borne disease testing. So we \u2013 of course, we have competition across all of our products \u2013 but we think we're better positioned with a highly differentiated product line and a little bit more concentrated customer set. Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. And then I'll ask a second question. I'll try to make it into two parts. I guess the first one, you beat our estimate by a penny, but you fell pretty well far below in CAG, EBIT, the unallocated was meaningfully ahead. Brian, is that a function of some of the FX hedges that you mentioned? I guess I'm just trying to sort of tie out why the \u2013 the EBIT missed and CAG and came so far ahead in unallocated. And then Jon, part B of that is to shift gears. At a high level, can you just share with us any other surprises? I mean, you're six to nine months into this transition, I'm guessing call it the first-gen rapid churn is a surprise on the negative side. Anything else you want to call out negative or positive at this point? Thanks, guys. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Look, I think our profit performance reflected better than expected operating expense performance in the quarter which was largely just driven by timing of costs. We saw some pressure there but relatively less than we anticipated and that helped us to deliver solid results in the quarter. The unallocated segment includes things like capitalized variance benefits on product cost that we, for simplicity, kind of capture that centrally. And so that's a true benefit to the company; it's just where we reflect in in terms of our segment reporting. It is a lower product cost benefit that helps us support better margins. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And Jon, to answer your questions, I think the ones were on surprises in the quarter. I would call out two. First of all, our European organization really took the Catalyst One launch and delivered over 100% growth in Catalyst platform placements. Not all of them are Catalyst One's, but they have really demonstrated the potential of Catalyst One in our international markets and that's just an extraordinary performance. And of course, they had very strong growth in the hematology platform, too. And we have a very good set of direct sales organizations in Europe. We have it internationally; we haven't launched it fully internationally yet but that was very impressive performance. And their momentum, I might say, our instrument placement momentum in the second quarter, both internationally and the U.S., the order rates continue to be extending from the momentum we had out of Q1. So that was very, very impressive. The second thing is SDMA. We knew SDMA was going to be a really innovative test, but we have been surprised that what SDMA has done to allow us to gain access to veterinarians that would normally screen out sales reps. They want to hear about it. And the reason why they want to hear about SDMA is because every week, they suffer the pain of diagnosing too late a chronic kidney patient; and typically these only have months to live and there's not a lot they can do. There's short term things to do, but it's a very frustrating thing for a veterinarian to diagnose something too late. And SDMA gives them a lot more time to have a lot more opportunity to slow the progression of this irreversible disease. And they want to hear about it and it is well researched with a number of patients \u2013 dozens of papers and abstracts including one that just got launched \u2013 published yesterday. So well documented, they want to hear about it. Our reps are fully able to talk to them about it. Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks for your time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wilson with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. On sort of the retention rate in rapid assay platform, when a clinic switches over, how would you characterize those types of practices? Is it high-volume rapid users? Are they still using 4Dx? Are they experiencing lots of fluctuations on the equipment side of the business, the reference laboratory testing? If you could characterize that dynamic, that would be great. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Right. As we \u2013 as I mentioned \u2013 it's really a tale of two parts of the rapid assay business. We saw good volume gains in the first quarter for our highly differentiated products including SNAP 4Dx and some of our specialized rapid assay, but we saw volume declines and some prices we responded in the first generation. The first generation products like the feline combo product and heartworm, they were launched in the early 1990s, so they have been around a while. So it's really a different behavior between the two \u2013 this is \u2013 the thing about rapid assay is you can \u2013 a customer can switch back and forth. Sometimes they try something and they realize it wasn't what they thought it was or wasn't what it was built to be or didn't have the accuracy. It's very painful to miss a positive, which is really important because we're diagnosing deadly infectious diseases here. And when they miss a positive \u2013 one positive that they miss because perhaps the platform they were using and the product they were using is not as accurate \u2013 can be very painful. So, we saw that's when our competitor in the reference lab business launched \u2013 reference lab competitor of 4Dx \u2013 people tried it but they came back. And many of them came back, so we expect to see a little bit of that kind of churn. But we think we have \u2013 we think we have the outlook calibrated. Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And in light of the noted competition, it seems like it's a little bit greater than what you initially thought. Do you see the need to step up investment or expand your salesforce over the next six to 12 months or is this something that you're going to reassess at a later date? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. No, I think what \u2013 our plans that were already in place are underway. And as I mentioned, we are adding the professional service veterinarians. We always planned to add that in the second quarter; that's on track. Most of those are already hired and on board. And so that's an expansion that's already underway. But I think it's more that we're gaining both relationships and experience in the new model \u2013 as we have demonstrated \u2013 happens when we made the first change in 2013. Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. We'll go to the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. I guess, starting off with Brian. Could you give us some color on your free cash flow? Turned negative on the operating cash side and there's a big change in working capital, I'm just wondering, what's causing that and how should we think about that going forward? Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : A lot of that is just driven by the transition of the go-direct model and stepping up the \u2013 our internal receivables levels and inventory. We had projected before $15 million to $20 million increase this year in working capital related to that change and I think that's basically all you're seeing there. And our full year outlook is largely the same. We are growing very quickly in the lab business and doing more self-manufacturing and we have increased some investment in those areas and that was what was noted in the free cash flow outlook. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great, that's helpful. And then, Jon, just going back to some of the new competitive offerings starting with SDMA. I think you guys said that's going to be included in all panels. And it's obviously great that it will help vets diagnose for earlier treatment options, but just wondering how you're thinking about the revenue generation expectations and how can you participate in some of these earlier treatment options to benefit IDEXX? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Well, we are not \u2013 that's a great question. Okay. So we're not in the treatment business, we're in the diagnostic business, but I will tell you that those who are in the treatment business are very interested in promoting SDMA because it expands their treatment options. I mean, obviously, if you can catch it in one case, 19 months earlier or six to 12 months earlier and slow the progression through whatever treatments that there are out there, that's good for their business. So that's kind of a positive tailwind in our business. From our perspective, it really drives our overall recurring revenues. Veterinarians appreciate highly that we are adding it at no incremental cost to the chemistry panel. What this will do, Kevin, is instantly change the standard of care in veterinary practice. And so, that's going to aid in customer retention, customer acquisition. It makes a stronger case to do preventative care testing, because if you can catch things earlier in a preventative care scenario that's \u2013 that pets live longer. And then also, we'll have a revenue stream from those who just want to send us their samples for SDMA only, as I mentioned into my comments. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. And actually I just had one quick follow-up there. On the urine sediment analyzer, I think you said it was going to be $150 million to $200 million in revenue over five years. Is that all incremental or how should we think about cannibalization away from like some in-clinic and reference lab testing? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I greatly appreciate that question. First of all, it doesn't cannibalize anything internally because what it is replacing is manual microscopy, right. So this is a are brand-new category. This isn't an incremental, a better, faster, cheaper version of something that we already offer. This is a totally new category, so it's all incremental to in-house. We have found that testing begets testing. When it's easier to do a urine sediment, you're going to do more of them. Most \u2013 we think that there are roughly a little bit more than half of urine sediments are run in-house \u2013 some are sent out to the reference lab. This could make the case to run it more in-house, but we've seen really time and again, when you run more testing, it generates more reflex testing at the reference lab. And this was the question that we got when we launched our very innovative \u2013 I remember we got this question a lot \u2013 when we launched LaserCyte over a decade ago. Is that going to take away from reference lab business? And you've seen, of course, the reference lab business grow and the market grow significantly over that period of time. So the nice thing is it's all \u2013 this is a whole new category of testing for us and reinforces really the value of having an integrated IDEXX suite of analyzers because they all work together with one patient. It's fully integrated into the software, and of course, instant results through VetConnect Plus. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Sounds good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. You were able to accelerate competitive account wins to 59% from 54% on Catalyst. Is the 59% a global number and would you attribute the acceleration largely to Italy and other parts of Europe? And then maybe the second part, Jon, given the lower price point of Catalyst One, I'm curious what your degree of confidence is to accelerate competitive wins into the 60%'s? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, that is a U.S. number or North American number. That is not \u2013 the 59% \u2013 is not a global number. So it's a little harder to track globally. Obviously, when you had 66% growth in Catalyst placements internationally, it's coming from a lot of places. So obviously, international was a good number but I really wanted to focus on the North America. We believe there are over 10,000 accounts that have the opportunity for us to convert to a Catalyst One. Catalyst One is a very effective price point and it is \u2013 brings far more capability to the practice in terms of menu, in terms of time to resolve, in terms of ease of use, in terms of workflow, of course, integration with VetConnect PLUS. I mean, the list goes on. So \u2013 and at a very competitive price point \u2013 so we expect that number is, as I've mentioned, again North American number, we expect that number to stay strong and perhaps grow over time as our salesforce gains in their capacity and their relationships with all the customers in their territory. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : I'd just add, we get a lot of questions as you know, on the chemistry dynamics in the U.S., our Catalyst space expanded in the quarter and our consumable revenues continued to grow well ahead of market growth rates. So we're expanding our presence. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, that's \u2013 and acquisitions net of Perfection (45:27). So, and of course, the consumable growth is what it's all about and that's growing, as Brian mentioned, higher than \u2013 at very attractively and higher at-market rate. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. And then maybe my follow-up question, with the Catalyst One launching in Asia-Pacific and Latin America, I think you said it might roll into Q3. I'm curious if there's any modest delay there and maybe can you help us frame what your expectations are in some of these, what I might call, emerging markets? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, well, no, there's no delay. This is \u2013 this was \u2013 it is totally \u2013 these smaller country operations are \u2013 they have \u2013 we have limited \u2013 we have, of course, direct capability, but they're limited, they've got a lot going on. So the Q2 and Q3 are really very consistent with our plans. No delay in launching, as I mentioned, the instrument is performing really fabulously and that of course makes it easier to launch in these smaller country operations. I might mention, for example, when we say Asia-Pacific, we're talking about Australia. I wouldn't call that an emerging market. That's a very attractive market for us; but of course we've got the Asian countries. The only market we're not going to be able to launch it in this year is Japan, because that has regulatory approval associated with it. We're also very excited about our presence in Latin America, but for Venezuela, which is basically gone off the map. We've got a great organization in Brazil and Mexico and some of the other South American countries. As you know, we acquired our distributor in Brazil and they've really gotten off to a great start. And so \u2013 this analyzer is just very, very well suited to the kinds of practices that are \u2013 smaller practices, these are typically international but also in the U.S. that didn't buy the Catalyst DX, it was too much analyzer for them, maybe a little bit higher price point. Catalyst One brings all capability of DX at a lower price point. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go to the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James. Your line is open. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. A lot of topics have been addressed, but just two ones for me. Regarding the hedging gains, Brian, that you've talked about, I think, several times in the release, I think it was $0.33 to earnings and that's offsetting some of the FX headwind. How should we be thinking about that for 2016 in terms of the modeling? Is that a baseline of take our 2015 number, $0.33 lower and grow, or just maybe help us sort of better understand the economics or math behind the hedging gains for 2016? Thanks. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Sure. Yeah, no, we obviously haven't given any indications for 2016 at this point, but I do think it's important to note that we will not have the benefit of those gains next year. So that will be something that we'll need to lap and will be a headwind for us heading into next year, which is why we're trying to disclose it and be clear on that. As you know, hedges are effectively something that delay impacts; they don't eliminate things so the prior hedges we put in place kind of protect our profit this year, but as those roll off the net impact of the substantial strengthening of the dollar will be reflected in our operations. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the color there. And then on the \u2013 going back to the rapid assay, not trying to beat a dead horse here \u2013 but thinking about the timing of some of the competitive announcements. Baxter's, I think, had some inter-quarter new placement \u2013 or new approvals \u2013 and considering, I think, Jon, you mentioned that you're expecting more of a headwind in the back half of the year relative to what you witnessed in 1Q regarding this first-generation devices. Is that the reason from a \u2013 because you're a little bit worried about competition or is there something I'm missing there? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Again, my comments were focused on the first-generation of products. And I think it's just a calibration as we look at all the factors involved. The competitive products are out there. They were out there in the first quarter. That affect these first-generation of products. So I think it's just basic \u2013 we wanted to make sure that we calibrated it correctly \u2013 as best we could using our judgment. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Haynor with Feltl & Company. Your line is open. Ben C. Haynor - Feltl & Co.: Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the questions. First of all, on the urine analyzer, you project a launch early in 2016. On the $150 million over five years, do you mean cumulative revenue over five years or looking at $150 million annually in kind of 2020 or 2021? Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : No, that was a cumulative \u2013 it was to just kind of give you a ballpark understanding \u2013 but it was a cumulative over the first five years. Obviously, we're going to sell it beyond the five years; it has a consumable stream. We think that virtually every practice is a candidate to buy this analyzer because virtually every practice does a manual urine sediment review as part of the work-up. But it's a cumulative number. Ben C. Haynor - Feltl & Co.: Okay, thank you. And then on the rapid assays \u2013 excuse me \u2013 have you changed or do you expect to change the 4Dx pricing as a result of the pressure on the first-generation single test products? Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : No, I think, we're always fine tuning our pricing strategy. One of the things we have is a program called SNAP Up the Savings; that's worked for us historically. We are always fine tuning that. But I think the trends that we saw in Q1 with \u2013 where we had good volume \u2013 very, very good volume means that really \u2013 not in the 4Dx, not a lot of pricing gains. It was real \u2013 good volume would be the expectation that we have, generally speaking, for the balance of the year. Ben C. Haynor - Feltl & Co.: Okay, great. That's all I had. Thank you, gentlemen. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open. Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. It's actually funny, I thought I took myself out of the queue but while I've got you I might as well ask it. Just at a high level, Jon, I mean, again going back to the rapids, the $65 million to $50 million, can you just talk about where we go from here? In other words, I'm just trying to figure out, do you believe that continues to bleed lower? And I guess what I'm trying to ask another way is, when we get beyond 2015 where things just went pretty south pretty quickly in that direction if you sort of strip out the margin capture, you're looking down according to our numbers, I think, down 3% to 4%. Can you restage growth in rapids in 2016? Thanks, guys. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We haven't really given a guidance for 2016, but what I will mention is, we do have superior products and this is the first quarter within our new sales model. And so, we're really ramping up our relationships and in case of infectious disease, which of course the majority of rapid assays are infectious disease, our professional service veterinarians are important. And our marketing strategies to this broad base of customers, both not just field, but of course, phone-based (52:49) and other marketing strategies. So, we think we've correctly calibrated the reset here for the introduction of new competition. Obviously, what's really driving growth in IDEXX is the continued innovation across the diagnostic portfolio and we think that's \u2013 again these products, in many cases, were launched over 20 years ago \u2013 but we think it's really the innovations that are going to be driving our growth going forward. And we do \u2013 we're refining our strategies to keep the entire customer relationship in all the product lines and certainly when we're calling on customers \u2013 when we call on customers we do a very good job of talking about the level of differentiation. It's just that we can't always get to all customers with our direct field organization early on with the new competitive entrants. Operator : And with that, you can go ahead with any closing remarks. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So I want to thank everybody for being on the call. And I really also would take this time to congratulate the IDEXX organization. This was a major transformation that we undertook in 2015 with our U.S. direct strategy. Our international operations just had an extraordinary performance. I think it sets us up well for the year globally. And certainly our product and innovation teams, as I've mentioned, our innovation is in high gear with a variety of product launches that start from next week and extend over the course of the year \u2013 balanced toward the first part of this upcoming 12 months \u2013 and then the urinalysis analyzer \u2013 a whole new analyzer. So, we've got the field organizations to sell the product and our innovation is on track. So with those closing comments, I'll conclude the call and thank you, everybody. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, today's conference call will be available for replay after 10 :30 AM today until midnight May 5.

We do appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back in the queue and if time permits, we'll be more than happy to take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll take you through our second quarter results and discuss our outlook for full-year performance and Jon will follow with his comments and observations. We had solid results in Q2 supported by consistent organic revenue gains in line with our expectations. In terms of highlights, our second quarter revenues were $413 million, up 6% on a reported basis. Foreign exchange changes over last year resulted in a 7% year-on-year reduction in reported growth and lower operating profits by $7 million or about $0.05 per share, net of hedge benefits. Despite these impacts, we delivered EPS results of $0.60 per share in Q2, up 9% on a reported basis or 18% year-on-year adjusting for FX changes. Results were supported by consistent 11% normalized organic revenue growth and better-than-expected operating margins. Instrument placements were very strong in the quarter. Worldwide premium placements increased 37% reflecting 44% growth in Catalyst instruments and 30% growth in premium hematology. Overall, we placed approximately 2,400 chemistry and hematology instruments in total in the quarter and we are on track to significantly exceed our global placement goals for this year. John will talk more about this progress in his comments. Recurring CAG Diagnostic revenues grew 14% organically in the second quarter or 13% when normalized for prior year changes in distributor inventories. These results were in line with our expectations supported by continued strong growth in reference lab and VetLab consumable revenues in U.S. and international markets. Based on our Q2 performance, we are maintaining a consistent financial outlook for the full year. We will walk through our full-year guidance in more detail later in my comments. In discussing our results and outlook today, we will focusing on our overall revenue growth including margin capture benefits associated with our transition to a fully direct sales model in the U.S. Our original estimates of incremental annual revenue from this change were in the range of $50 million to $55 million for 2015. We now estimate these benefits will be approximately $45 million, factoring in our updated revenue growth projections and estimated net impacts from a range of customer service enhancements we've implemented along with the all-direct change, including free next day shipping and a new return policy for expired product. Given that this change is now fully integrated to our business operations and reporting, we will no longer be estimating the discrete impact of margin capture on specific growth rates. Let's begin with a review of our Q2 performance by segment and region. Organic growth in Q2 continued to be driven by strong global CAG gains. Global CAG revenues were $352 million, reflecting 13% normalized organic growth. Our Water business also continued its solid revenue gains, increasing 8% organically to $25 million, reflecting strong existing and new business growth across major regions. Our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy business revenue was $32 million, down modestly as solid gains in Europe, North America and China were offset by tough comparisons to high prior year growth in Australian livestock and poultry testing. Overall, U.S. revenues were $254 million in the growth, up 13 % organically. U.S. gains were supported by strong instrument revenues and 12% normalized CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth reflecting continued strong growth in reference lab and instrument consumable sales. IDEXX performance continues to outpace solid U.S. market growth, reflected in our broadened market growth data set from approximately 5,200 clinics. In Q2, this market level data showed patient visits increased 3.7% and clinic revenues increased 6.5%, in line with improved Q1 market growth. International revenues in the second quarter were $159 million, up 12% on a constant currency basis. International normalized organic growth was over 11% supported by 13% normalized organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting continued strong gains across major regions. As noted, global instrument placements were outstanding in the quarter, driving 38% organic growth in instrument revenues to $24 million, including approximately 16% of growth benefit from recognition of deferred revenue related to Catalyst One introductory offers. Strong global placement gains set a foundation for continued strong growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Global CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues were $300 million in Q2, up 14% organically or 13% normalized. Instrument consumable revenues of $101 million grew 19% normalized in Q2, supported by strong global volume gains and net benefits from U.S. margin capture. Continued strong premium instrument placements and high penetration of competitive and greenfield accounts are supporting a continued expansion of our instrument base in U.S. and international markets. In the U.S., our growing Catalyst installed base now drives approximately 95% of our consumable revenues exclusive of corporate accounts. Our reference laboratory and consulting services modality with revenues of $133 million grew organically 12% in the second quarter, supported by strong double-digit volume-driven gains in the U.S. We expect continued strong growth in lab revenues going forward as we leverage our expanded commercial capability and capture benefits from our significantly enhanced and highly differentiated test menu, including recently introduced SDMA and fecal antigen panels. Rapid assay revenues increased 3% normalized in Q2 to $52 million, consistent with our expectations. Benefits from margin capture and continued strong growth in specialty test offset expected declines in first-generation products and anticipated carryover impacts from first quarter stocking programs. Overall, volumes for 4Dx Test increased year to date as strong growth in lab tests more than offset slight volume declines in clinic. Jon will talk more talk about dynamics in this area in his comments. Overall Information Management and Digital Imaging System revenues increased 5% supported by 2% organic gains and benefits from recent acquisitions. Information System's revenues increased slightly reflecting growing recurring revenues from an expanded installed base including growth in Pet Health Network Pro. We successfully advanced our transition towards a subscription-based software-as-a-service model and practice management. As noted in our last call, this transition will moderate near-term revenue growth reflecting the evolution from a license sale driven revenue model to a subscription based model that will provide a powerful foundation for accelerated, highly profitable growth moving forward. Information Management gains were offset by declines in digital business revenues in the quarter impacted by increased levels at deferred revenue deals associated with bundled business commitments and near-term impacts associated with the alignment of new territory sales accountabilities. Turning to our P&L review, we delivered strong financial performance in the quarter despite continued FX headwinds. Operating profit was 88 million, up 6%. Excluding currency impacts operating profits increased 13%. Operating margins of 21% were in line with prior year levels and better than expected, primarily reflected timing and management of operating expenses in the quarter. Gross profit was $233 million in Q2, up 7% on a reported basis. Gross profit margins increased modestly benefiting from lower product and royalty costs as well as net favorable margin impacts from foreign exchange reflecting benefits from hedge gains. Foreign exchange hedge gains reported in gross profit were $5 million or $0.04 per share in Q2. Operating expenses increased 7% in Q2 reflecting planned increases in global commercial capability including resources added in support of the U.S. all-direct sales model. Reported operating expense growth was moderated by impacts from foreign exchange. As noted, EPS was $0.60 per share, up 9% on a reported basis and 18% adjusted for currency impacts. EPS growth benefited from share repurchases advanced over the last year which reduced average share account year-on-year by 9%. In Q2, repurchased 1,415,000 shares adjusted for our recent two-for-one stock split for $92 million. We ended Q2 with approximately 1.1 billion in debt outstanding including a new \u20ac90 million10-year fixed 1.785% debt issuance funded in June. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of EBITDA adjusted to exclude transition impacts associated with the all-direct change were 2.9 times gross and 2.0 times net of $344 million and cash and investment balances at quarter end, in line with our long-term target leverage range. Looking ahead, we're maintaining our full-year outlook which includes expectations for higher second half revenue growth supported by our innovation pipeline. We're maintaining our 2015 revenue guidance range at $1.60 billion to $1.62 billion reflecting our outlook for 12% to 13% normalized organic revenue growth. This reflects expectations for higher expected revenue growth in the second half associated with benefits from our recently launched SDMA and fecal antigen tests in reference labs, our Total T4 slide for Catalyst Dx and a new SNAP test for leptospirosis. We also expect growth benefits from relatively more favorable comparisons in the second half in select areas including lapping of Q4 2014 programs in support of the U.S. direct transition. At the exchange rate shown in our press release, we estimate that effects in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar will reduce full-year revenue growth by about 6% and adjusted EPS by an estimated $0.13 per share. Please note that our 2015 profit outlook benefits from about $21 million in pre-tax foreign currency hedge gains from previously established contracts which mitigate the 2015 profit impacts from the stronger dollar. This equates to about $0.16 per share in after-tax EPS benefit. At current rates and timing of hedge contracts, we will not have the benefit of these hedge gains in 2016. Our 2015 EPS outlook is $2.07 to $2.12, which is consistent with our prior outlook adjusted for a recent two-for-one stock split. On a constant currency basis, this equates to 11% to 13% growth over 2014 adjusted EPS levels which included about $0.03 per share benefit from the extension of the R&D tax credit. Other elements of our full-year profit outlook are basically consistent with our prior guidance including expectations for an effective tax rate of about 30%. Please note that our 2015 tax rate outlook does not assume the further extension of the R&D tax credit, which has been renewed every year since 1997. Assuming renewal, we would expect an incremental EPS benefit of approximately $0.04 per share this year. We're also maintaining our free cash flow outlook at 80% to 90% of net income, incorporating higher working capital levels associated with the U.S. all-direct transition and consistent expectations for capital spending levels of about $100 million this year, driven in part by capacity expansion in our labs business and in our manufacturing operations in support of business growth. For Q3, we expect a 1% to 2% improvement in our normalized organic growth rate, reflecting benefits from new product introductions and a favorable expected normalization benefit related to prior-year distributor inventory changes. At FX rates assumed in our press release, this should correspond to Q3 revenue in the $405 million to $410 million range. We expect Q3 operating margins will be 18.5% to 19%. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the discussion over to Jon for his comments. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Brian. As Brian indicated, we reported solid results for the second quarter, in line with our expectations. We are well-positioned for accelerating organic revenue growth in the second half of the year, given our unprecedented level of recently announced innovations and an enhanced global commercial capability. Our instrument placement performance in the second quarter was strong. Overall, we placed about 2,400 chemistry and hematology instruments in the quarter, nearly matching our record fourth quarter 2014. These 2,400 placements were up 29% year-over-year and 21% over the excellent Q1 results. The placements were composed of 1,132 Catalyst Chemistry Analyzers up 44% year-over-year; 318 VetTest Chemistry units; and 949 premium hematology placements, up 30% year-over-year and 27% over the first quarter. The premium hematology placements were driven by the higher end ProCyte analyzer, which was up 44% versus the prior year. Our international performance was truly outstanding where Catalyst placements of 683 units were up 137% from a respectable Q2 2014 and hematology placements were up 55%. In Q2, we continued the global rollout of Catalyst One with launches in Australia and Brazil and will complete our Catalyst One launches in non-Japan Asia and the rest of Latin America in Q3. North America had a solid premium instrument placement quarter of 909 units, accelerating 15% over Q1. Of the 449 Catalyst placements in North America, 61% were to new and competitive accounts, a high-water mark matched only once before. We have a strong pipeline of orders in North America entering Q3 with good sales momentum as our expanded sales organization is deepening their relationships in their geographically more concentrated territories. The smaller territories allowing for greater customer intimacy, our goal, as we \u2013 as our sales expansion has now been in place six months. Our sales professionals are also continuing to advance as subject matter experts and diagnostics in the unique value of our offerings. Globally, Catalyst One has been an unrivalled success in every country in which it has been introduced. In fact, we are on track to place well over 9,000 chemistry and hematology units globally in 2015. This includes a forecast of over 4,500 Catalyst Chemistry placements for the year, up 45% from 2014. This outlook bodes well for sustained double-digit instrument consumable growth for years to come. Other news in our VetLab modality includes the full launch of Total T4 slide in North America, including to our large installed base of Catalyst Dx customers. The availability of this important component of the chemistry profile and its ability to be included with any chemistry panel with up to 22 other chemistries in one sample run with quick turnaround time is unique to the IDEXX Catalyst platform and brings a new differentiated value to our Catalyst Dx install base, augmenting the already high installed base royalty. The new Total T4 slide also contributes to the increasing recurring diagnostic revenue growth in the second half of the year. Note that the T4 slide has already been available to Catalyst One customers since February, where we already had an over 60% adoption rate. Our global reference lab modality continues to see strong double-digit growth of 12%, with a couple of points' higher growth in the U.S. A few comments on SDMA. The full launch of SDMA in the U.S. is underway in July as we indicated in a press release earlier this week. Numbers are accumulating quickly. As mentioned in the earnings release this morning, we now have over 9,000 accounts that have received over 140,000 patient SDMA results. Mostly as part of their routine send-out chemistry panels but also including standalone SDMA submissions. An interesting fact, these numbers include submissions from over 1,000 accounts who use a competitive reference lab as their primary lab. With this overall volume utilization at our customers, you can see why we expect SDMA will transition in a relatively short period of time from an exciting novel assay to an indispensable element of our customers' routine protocol for preventative and sick animal testing. In this way, the inclusion of an SDMA result will become the new standard of care in chemistry testing, diagnosing and managing chronic kidney disease, one of the most common feline and canine medical conditions. In addition, we're offering a send-out SDMA result at no incremental charge for customers who use both our in-house chemistry instrument and our reference lab services, when they run a patient sample on their Catalyst Chemistry Analyzer in-house. This bundled profile offering further builds the value of using IDEXX for both in-house and reference lab diagnostics, increasing loyalty and supporting cross-selling of reference lab services and in-house equipment. We expect Canada will start the full SDM launch \u2013 SDMA launch next week and our other international labs will roll out the full launch over the first half of 2016. We were excited this week that the International Renal Interest Society, or IRIS, has endorsed SDMA by recognizing that SDMA is a new biomarket for renal dysfunction that can allow for earlier detection of chronic kidney disease. According to IRIS, \"SDMA has the potential to expand diagnostic insight and therapeutic opportunities for veterinarians caring for pets with this critical disease.\" In fact, IRIS announced in a press release this morning that SDMA is now included as a component of their well-known IRIS chronic kidney staging guidelines. For investor background, IRIS is a board of 15 world-renowned independent veterinarians, with a particular expertise in nephrology, from 10 different countries. The endorsement of SDMA by IRIS is a capstone to the credibility of 27 peer-reviewed abstracts and publications already available on SDMA in the cat and the dog. In addition to the T4 slide in SDMA, we had a third important customer product announcement this month. We're excited to have begun shipping our SNAP Lepto rapid assay in July. This highly valued point-of-care test is very much appreciated by our customers. Early adopters and key opinion leaders indicate that every practice should have a SNAP Lepto Test kit available in practice to use when a dog is presented with the common symptoms of leptospirosis and when it's on the differential list so as to rule out or aid in the diagnosis of this disease. Note that leptospirosis is contagious and highly dangerous to pets and humans alike. We expect SNAP Lepto will contribute $1 million to $2 million in rapid assays in the second half of this year and continue to contribute to the rapid assay growth for years to come. As Brian indicated, our rapid assay modality revenues met our expectations in Q2. During the quarter, we completed several direct head-to-head studies including one that was peer-reviewed by key opinion leaders and experts, which compare recently available competitive rapid assays test to the high standard of our SNAP ELISA platform assays. These studies demonstrate that our assays, including our feline kits and our SNAP 4Dx, have superior sensitivity, that is, the ability to detect the presence of certain diseases, as compared to the more recent offerings and assays for these same diseases that use a lateral flow platform based on the types of positive patients typically seen in practice. As an example, the peer-reviewed study shows a comparison of sensitivity of SNAP 4Dx versus a competitive offering for ehrlichia ewingii on lateral flow. In this case IDEXX 4Dx had 92% sensitivity versus 60% for the lateral flow test. The head-to-head differences in test sensitivity are quite meaningful. Veterinarians rate test accuracy is by far the most important criteria in choosing a diagnostic test kit, as well they should, when the sole purpose of such test kits is to accurately determine which patients have contracted an infectious disease to enable prompt follow-on care. Positive patients that are missed because the test has inferior sensitivity can not only result in the incorrect diagnosis but also lost income from missed follow-on diagnostics, treatments, and monitoring. We are well-positioned to bring this clinical data to our SNAP customers with our U.S. direct sales organization, including our 181 veterinary diagnostic consultants and 14 professional service veterinarians. It will take time to reach the entire market and the long-tail customers who rely on SNAP accuracy, and to address the incorrect assumption that competitive lateral flow tests are of equivalent accuracy. However, we are confident in our unique ability to do so with our fully direct sales model and to continue to support the profession with a strong rapid assay franchise in 2015 and years to come. We continue to be on track with the development of our urine sediment analyzer called SEDIVUE for launch in early 2016. This novel point-of-care technology provides an entirely new automated and highly accurate way to conduct an in-house urine analysis which is currently a manual bench-top process requiring time-consuming sample prep and microscopic examination, conducted by virtually all veterinary practices and usually several times a day. With this new instrument, the entire market is a greenfield opportunity. Each instrument placement will generate a new stream of consumable revenues without any cannibalization to further differentiate our entire in-house lab solution. On a concluding note, and before we open the call to Q&A, please note that we will be broadcasting our Annual Investor Day next Wednesday and Thursday. During that presentation, we will be detailing several of our novel innovations and key technologies, and dimensioning the size of the global market opportunity and their role in driving long-term double-digit organic revenue growth. Five of these include, first, the long-term opportunity for Catalyst One placements and the continuing impact on recurring instrument consumable growth; second, SDMA and the impact this revolutionary advancement in the core chemistry panel will have on our recurring revenues; third, the greenfield opportunity for SEDIVUE instrument and consumable stream in the automation of in- house urinalysis; fourth, our fecal antigen franchise, another greenfield opportunity, including the recently launched reference lab offering and our fecal product roadmap; fifth, finally, the role that our proprietary bovine pregnancy testing offering will have to grow our livestock and poultry diagnostic business on a global basis. In addition, we will discuss our long-term goals to expand margins, enabled by our innovations and organic revenue growth. With that, I open the call to your questions. Operator : Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Jon, let me start with one for you regarding to head-to-head studies. I've seen several of them recently on your website. I guess my curiosity is how quickly do you think you can get that message of the superior sensitivity into the market? And then when that has been presented to veterinarians, have you seen that actually resonate quickly and then switching back to your assays once they understand the sensitivity? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Ryan, thank you for the question. We just had a \u2013 I was with the \u2013 our U.S. sales organization all week last week and I'm really impressed. These reps have over 10 years of sales experience. Of course many of them are new to IDEXX, hired last fall. But they're coming up to speed quickly. We talked about the head-to-head studies, including the new peer-reviewed study that I mentioned for ehrlichia, and I think they're going to be quite good at that. The experience we have, even before the peer-reviewed, is that when customers appreciate the differences in sensitivity, they do switch back. Of course, there are a lot of customers to reach. We have a long tail of customers particularly for our feline products, but of course a smaller number but a significant number on our SNAP 4Dx, a fabulous franchise. And so I suspect that we'll be quite effective. But as I mentioned, it will probably take time to reach that group with our normal calling patterns over the next quarter or two. When we do, we're very effective in switching customers back on the ones that have decided to try the newer lateral flow assays; of course most are loyal to IDEXX. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, that's helpful color. And then, one follow-up on SDMA and I'll hop back in the queue, I think you mentioned a 1,000 clinics that use another lab as their primary lab provider. Do you have a feel for many of them you actually had been working with prior to the SDMA launch? So is it \u2013 they're sending them to you but you've already had relations, are a lot of these novel relationships? And then can you remind me the price of that for them versus the price of a full chemistry profile? Thank you. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, thank you. So, the 1,000 accounts that are not \u2013 do not use IDEXX as their primary lab, typically they use us at a very low, or if any, volume. The SDMA that they're sending us sometimes it's their entire chemistry panel because they want the SDMA result with the chemistry panel, other times it's just the SDMA result. In fact probably more often than not it's the entire chemistry panel. And that's a mix of customers who have done business with us. Obviously we have a (30:50 \u2013 30:52) testing portfolio and customers that haven't done business with us. But I will say, I'm pretty surprised that just in a few short weeks we have a 1,000 accounts that aren't our primary lab customers who have adopted this new test and are using it. I've just never seen anything like that in terms of adoption of a new specialized test. In this case of course it's really now a component, critical component of the core chemistry panel. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wilson with Bank of America. Your line is open. Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. You mentioned the change in disclosure on the margin capture and the lower contribution relative to your initial view. So, on a net basis at this point, what are you gaining in the way of economics this year from the direct transition? Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : The \u2013 as you mentioned the revenue number, we modified down a bit from the $50 million to $55 million range to the $45 million range. I think on a \u2013 it's fully (31:57 \u2013 31:59) with our business now, so it's a little tougher to parse but I think that net flow-through is probably more in the breakeven level to modestly accretive versus the $5 million to $8 million benefit that we had anticipated. Going back in time, we didn't do this for $5 million to $8 million of profitability, obviously this was intended to be a significant step-up in our commercial capability, allow us to fund that, and to position us well for accelerated long-term growth and we feel very good about the progress we're making on that front. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Erin, I would comment, really building on Brian's comments that if you think for example the SDMA launch, that was a virtually false launch but we couldn't have reached 90% of veterinarians including more than half that learned about it from their representative in the first six months without a direct sales model. And so \u2013 and that was a just very, very successful launch. It's an example of what our direct sales organization allows us to do that we haven't been able to do previously. And just a follow-up on Ryan's question, I realize I didn't answer the last part. For customers who send in a full chemistry panel, the average price is, for a chemistry panel, might be $30 to $40, but for an SDMA-only result we offer that for $19.95, so it gives you a sense of the revenue contribution depending on how they submit their sample. Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Thanks. And there has been a lot of noise out there and I would just like you to comment I guess or characterize the pricing trends across your business relative to the volume contribution, particularly in the consumable side of the business I guess as well as in instruments? Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : We are a volume-driven business, always have been, but our pricing trends are positive. As we noted in our results, we had actually an improvement in our gross margins in the quarter and our underlying recurring CAG Diagnostic margins also improved. So net-net we are very much focused on growing the volume in our business consistent with our business strategy but we've seen effectively kind of consistent impacts of net pricing changes and we're able to improve our margins as we grow. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, and just a follow-up on that Erin, with regard to the instruments in particular, we have a variety of different types of programs. There really was no change in those programs from prior quarters. Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We will go the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open. Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, thanks, and good morning. I'll try to fit into two questions, maybe the first one will have two parts so just stay with me for a second. Jon, you maintain the guidance for the company but clearly your cornerstone data and our checks show that the industry has really picked up over the past six months. So can you talk about what that means for your implied market share losses so far this year? And as a function of that sort of do you think you are through the noise? I mean, again, I believe you lost share over the past six to nine months. I think that was a cost-sensitive crowd. You put out huge instruments numbers today to be fair. So, what's your conviction that there is sort of \u2013 you are through the noise, there is not a broader cost-sensitive crowd out storm to come? That's part one. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : A couple of comments, I believe that our recurring revenue growth was in excess of the market growth in the U.S. and of course we're a global company and then we have pretty strong performance in other businesses like the water business with 8% organic growth. So I'm very pleased with our performance in the U.S. As I mentioned our U.S. lab businesses was higher than our total global lab growth of 12% by a couple points. So, we're very pleased with where we are in the growth of the recurring diagnostic revenues in the U.S. and on a global basis. In addition, I think our \u2013 I think we've correctly gauged where we are in the new competitive environment and our guidance and our tracking is consistent with the guidance that we gave three months ago. Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, I will push you offline I guess, but to shift gears, according to our work, or looking at the P&L, the unallocated again seems to have accounted for the EPS upside. And Brian, I know there is always fluctuations but it looks like there is actually like a contra expense item in there for both 1Q and 2Q 2015 because EBIT's higher than gross profit, I went back, that's never happened in any of the other 36 quarters in my model going back to 2005. So, can you at a high level, and we don't need to get into all of the nuances of accounting, but can you just sort of walk through that, what's going on in unallocated that's leading to that event? Thanks. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : It's lower product costs for companion animal and LPD products. We record the segment results at a standard cost and the capitalized variances which are favorable for us, meaning that we had lower product costs than standard flowing through the unallocated portion. So, it is a net lower product cost for the company that just happens to be reflected in that segment. Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And so it happened in the past six months and never in the prior nine years, I'm just curious, so is that a function of going direct or something else in terms of the timing of that? Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : It just \u2013 I can't speak to the past... Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think it is a function... Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Last nine years but I think this is \u2013 we had benefits from lower product costs that got capitalized into inventory and now they're flowing through, that just reflect our... Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Good cost performance on the product side. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Good operations management and... Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And any change between expensing versus capitalizing or no? Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : No. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : No, it's just where it is recorded, Jon, that's all. Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, okay guys. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : We record at standard in the segments and we capitalize the variance and have that flowing through in unallocated, it's not an unusual practice. Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Fair enough, all right, thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. I just want to get a better sense of CAG gross margins. This is the second consecutive quarter where we've had CAG gross margins down year-over-year and considering that you are seeing double-digit recurring revenue, I would have assumed that we might have seen maybe a bit of improvement there particularly with the margin recapture, just \u2013 so I wanted to better understand kind of what's going on in CAG gross margins. Thanks. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Yeah, it builds up the question that we just answered which is we have lower product costs flowing through the unallocated segment and if you put that into the CAG picture, they would be actually improved. And the \u2013 actually the \u2013 keep in mind that as we have very strong instrument placements and the recognition of deferred revenue that has a bit of a negative mix impact on CAG. The underlying CAG recurring margins are improving. So I think the reported segment margin was only down 40 basis points and net-net the underlying CAG recurring margins including the product cost benefits have improved. So we actually see a positive trend on CAG recurring margins. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful color. And then secondly on the implied 2H organic revenue growth expectations, I think your normalized first half of the year is roughly 11.2%, 11.3% and in the full year it's 12% to 13%. So is there any buckets specifically that you could call out in terms of we expect SNAP Lepto to be a 50-basis-point improvement, we expect SDMA to be this, just wanted to get better comfort because I think there is a lot of concern surrounding the implied acceleration, so any incremental color there would be helpful. Thank you. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thank you. It's actually \u2013 first of all we have \u2013 we do have several new product launches that we've talked about in the last few weeks, all of which will benefit the second half as we've mentioned the T4 slide to our Dx installed base, the SNAP Lepto and the full launch of SDMA in our reference labs. In addition, we have some favorable compares in the second half with regard to some Q4 marketing programs that we had in the U.S. in 2014 associated with our go-direct and a little bit more favorable compare in our livestock and poultry business. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey guys. Thanks for the questions. So your rapid test business came in pretty stable and I was wondering if you could maybe talk about some of the competitive dynamics that you are seeing with the competition and lower-priced assays. Jon, can you comment on the 4Dx and your confidence in continuing to \u2013 or just clarification that you do not expect to lose share in that segment and really what is driving that? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. So our rapid assay modality overall tracked our expectations obviously of 4Dx which is by far the largest product in that category (41:32 \u2013 41:34) is \u2013 has to be a contributing factor there. Our volume actually in the first half of the year on 4Dx has grown. Sometimes customers use the 4Dx in the lab and sometimes they use it in clinic, sometimes they switch. And so when we look at the volumes across the two modalities, we've seen growth. And I think we've made a lot of progress in understanding the relative performance of our assays in the critical dimension of sensitivity, which of course is the dimension. That's the reason why customers purchase these rapid assay tests, is to determine whether a patient is \u2013 has contracted the infectious disease. We've seen some customers in some regions such as those that are more ehrlichia endemic temporarily switch to a competitive offering for ehrlichia. But when they are informed of the difference in \u2013 of the pretty dramatic difference in sensitivity, we get them back. And so that's a constant process. There are a lot of customers out there that we've got to talk to. And we've got new assets that are available to us as a result of the work we've done over the last quarter that is now in the hands of our sales organization. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. And my second question is we're hearing some rather aggressive commercial tactics from some of your competition and can you maybe just characterize maybe some of the instruments that other providers are throwing in to win business. You've been in this business a long time, so how would you characterize this type of activity? Do you foresee it occurring in many additional quarters? And how do you think you can continue to hold ground given this shift? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thanks for the question. It's always been a competitive market and we sell on really what is a lower cost system solution, when you take all factors into consideration. Our sales force, which was greatly expanded before the beginning of the year, is getting better and better at not only the customer relationships but being able to have that conversation. We are pleased with the premium instrument placement growth we saw in the U.S. in the second quarter over the first quarter. Of course that doesn't even speak to the extraordinary performance we had on a global basis on instrument placements. And there is really \u2013 if there is no difference in the economics of our programs as was asked by \u2013 in a previous question, and we've got the most complete product line when you look at our full instrument product line and of course our reference labs and when we can do a multimodal profile as we talked about on our in-house chemistry, with our send-out SDMA result. And the T4 is a wonderful addition not only to \u2013 of course we had it on Catalyst One but for the Dx which builds further differentiated value. We believe we continue to be unique in the ability to do two-way integration with the vast majority of practice management software that is in practice because it was built into that practice management software over many years. And the performance of our analyzers is uniquely designed for real-time care with quick turnaround time and minimum tech involvement. And so that with continued advancements in VetConnect PLUS for example where we had, I think, 100% growth in utilization VetConnect PLUS year-over-year in the U.S. market, really combined \u2013 that combined and a maturing commercial capability with a unprecedented product line really, we feel quite comfortable in this competitive environment Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : I would also just build on Jon's comments just to highlight that, of course we noted that we had a very strong premium instrument placement quarter in the U.S. with a high-water mark for the percentage going into competitive and greenfield accounts. And of note, we are expanding, and noted in our comments that we're expanding our instrument base in chemistry and hematology in the U.S. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Each quarter. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : So, it is expanding. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And that's net of customers who stopped using us, so it's a net expansion. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go to the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, I wanted to go back to one of the \u2013 I think Nick's question on the CAG gross margins, Brian. Could you help explain with the lower product cost that helped drive the unallocated amount, I guess, why would that be in unallocated versus CAG? Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : It's just a methodology we use for where we record it in segment recording for simplicity. For internal management, we use a standard cost for the business areas in terms of how they record their profit performance and if there is variances to performance then they get capitalized into inventory before they get recognized through the P&L. We capture that in the unallocated portion just to \u2013 as a way to kind of limit some of the noise on the internal management of the business. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, our internal management responsibility accounting is based on standard costs as you would expect and then our global worldwide operations folks are the ones who are doing quite a good job beating those standard costs. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : And so it's \u2013 the numbers were beneficial and that's what you see flowing through and they're somewhat larger than they had been in the past but it's reflective of good underlying business performance and strong volumes. And so that is a \u2013 it's a real benefit in that it's supporting improved CAG recurring diagnostic gross margins. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great, that's helpful. And then, so you provided some \u2013 an update on the distribution margin capture which you've revised a little bit lower. Just wondering why you've decided to stop disclosing kind of what the breakup or the benefit was on \u2013 for each of your segments, is this how you are going to report going forward? Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Yeah, we're obviously trying to give you an overall calibration so the net benefit is about 3% on growth versus the original 3.5% overall. When you get down at the modality level, we really have this fully integrated in our business now and so trying to parse the discrete impacts of adjustments we might be making across modalities related to the change, it's not how we are measuring the business. We're obviously measuring ourselves on our current revenues and it is becoming just harder to kind of estimate that with precision. So, we've given directional indications in the past on the benefit by modality and those are directionally consistent and obviously we've updated the overall number, but we're trying to move to a zone where we're talking about the revenues that we're measuring ourselves on and the revenues that drive our profitability performance and that's why we're moving away from this with and without calculation. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. Thank you. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. And next we'll go to a follow-up from Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open. Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, thanks, and thanks for taking the follow-up. Just two real quick ones, Jon, you gave us a little bit more color on U.S. lab noise out there as well but we certainly haven't thought you were losing share and I think you proved that today. You mentioned a couple of hundred basis points higher than the 12% worldwide, is that still predominantly volume? In the past, you've given us some color that in the U.S. it was vast, vast majority volume. Again broadly speaking, is that mostly a volume driven 14% or so? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes that is correct. It's predominantly volume-led. Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then the flipside, just I want to make sure I've got my arms around the rapid because maybe it's just myself being a curmudgeon but I don't view it as that strong. You print 8.5% organic but 5.9% is from some of the inventory fluctuations. So that gets you I believe to that 3% you sort of detail in the press release. And I know you are not giving the margin capture anymore but if it was anywhere close to last quarter of 9%, that would make the true organic down 6% and the D cell from last quarter is down 3%. So one most importantly, am I thinking it through correctly, and two can you just siphon through the noise and give us what you think is really going on in the trends in your rapid assay business? Thanks guys. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, thank you for the \u2013 I think that's \u2013 for the question, Jon. I think that's directionally direct and also consistent with the \u2013 our calibration of the business last quarter and the expectations that we set. So I think it's entirely in line with expectations. What we are pleased about is the new assets, an appreciation we have for the differences in our products in the critical area of test sensitivity. And we now have those \u2013 recently, obviously this is all very recently, have those resources in the field to be able to have those conversations. So that's I think a positive development from a marketing perspective but with regard to volumes, they are \u2013 the volumes were consistent with the expectations that we had them set in our April call. Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Perfect. Thanks Jon. Operator : Thank you and we have a follow-up from Nick Jansen with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, one, just quick numbers questions. Brian, I think you said earlier that you thought third quarter organic revenue growth would be up 1 to 2 points relative to the first half. Was that \u2013 did I hear that correctly? I just want to confirm that and if that is correct, does that imply kind of 13% to 14% or so in the fourth quarter based on the full-year guide? Thanks. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : It's 1% to 2% improvement in the normalized organic growth rate. Keep in mind we will have a favorable normalization benefit related to prior-year distributed inventory changes that get factored into that, but it is an improvement and we do to expect improvement in fourth quarter as well kind of building momentum as we are rolling out the new product introductions and that's built into the full-year growth outlook. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. I just wanted to make sure I heard that correctly. Thanks. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : You did. Operator : Thank you. We have a follow-up from Mark Massaro with Canaccord. Please go ahead. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, guys. I think you've done a nice job with the SDMA in the early goings here especially with competitive accounts. Jon, maybe could you try to quantify the uplift you think SDMA can hit your topline even directionally at roughly $20 per test for those that are not using your full panel. And then can you comment on (53:04 \u2013 53:06) patients of taking share or folks that migrate to your entire reference lab? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Mark, thank you for the question. Really as a result of years of work, including with the key opinion leaders and six months of preparing the market since we announced SDMA would be part of the core chemistry panel, we concluded a flawless launch earlier this month. And of course it's all in Q3, it's not reflected in our Q2 numbers. And really the excitement and the adoption rate is just quite gratifying. The SDMA will drive our growth on a number of dimensions. Higher loyalty with our current reference lab customers, greater utilization in preventive care, the ability to have greater price realization when we're faced with \u2013 a loyal customer who's faced with a competitive offering \u2013 a competitive offer that does not include SDMA. Of course, winning new accounts who want to instead of just sending us their \u2013 splitting their samples and sending their core to someone else and their SDMA to us and increasing their costs significantly, as a result just sending the entire chemistry panel to us. We have customers who routinely split their business between us and someone else who will, as they understand quickly and adopt SDMA, will be predisposed to seeing their chemistry panels to us if they haven't before. And then, finally, incremental revenue from the 1995 SDMA-only results. To your question about dimensionalizing that, we look forward to doing that next week at our analyst meeting, that is our intent. And I think we'll be able to fully satisfy your question in that regard at that time. Operator : Thank you. And with that, Mr. Ayers, I'd like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. I want to thank everybody who's been on the call. I know we also have a number of IDEXXers who are on the call or who will subsequently listen in. And I just want to congratulate our organization here for some extraordinary accomplishments in Q2. It really was an extraordinary quarter for the instrument business on a global basis. Sometimes we have to remind ourselves and everybody else that we are a global organization and Catalyst One is really just a blockbuster instrument. The flawless SDMA launch which we had in Q3, a wave of innovations that we're bringing to the market beyond those two products in terms of T4 on a slide, SDMA, we just introduced images for histo and cyto pathologies that are available on VetConnect PLUS, which is a wonderful advancement in the VetConnect PLUS form of receiving results and unique to IDEXX, and I think we have some great success in getting a better appreciation for the differentiation of our infectious disease assays and an organization globally that is really quite engaged. So my gratitude to everyone at IDEXX who helps deliver these results and we look forward to the Analyst Day next week. We will be broadcasting that in our Reg FD forum for all investors to hear and look forward to detailing the long-term organic growth, double digit that we think will come out of our innovation and our comments on margin expansion over the long term and then going into some detail in some of our strategies. So, with that, we will conclude the call. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, today's conference call will be available for replay after 10 :30 AM today until midnight August 6. You may access the AT&T teleconference replay system by dialing 800-475-6701 and entering the access code of 363893. International participants may dial 320-365-3844.

We do appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we'll be more than happy to take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Good morning, and thanks to everyone for joining us in our call. Today, I'll take you through our Q3 results and outlook for the full year, and I'll also provide an overview of our preliminary guidance for 2016. Jon will follow with his comments. In terms of highlights, we delivered 12% normalized organic revenue growth in the third quarter, supported by very strong instrument placements and continued strong growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Our profit results were solid in Q3, adjusted EPS was $0.54 per share, up 9% on a comparable constant currency basis. Please note that our adjusted EPS results exclude impacts from a capitalized software impairment charge. As part of our evolved information management strategy, we decided to refine our approach to developing our Practice Intelligence business, and our IDEXX Neo cloud-based information management software offering. Reprioritization of efforts in this area resulted in a non-cash charge of $8 million or about $0.06 per share in Q3. We'll talk more about the evolution of our information management approach, which is supporting strong revenue gains, later in the call. As we look forward, we're updating our full year 2015 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance today to reflect our growth current trends as well as some select impacts from foreign exchange changes and updated effective tax rate estimates. From an operating perspective, while our growth remains strong, we're tracking towards the lower-end of our earlier revenue guidance range for 2015, which had targeted a greater acceleration of growth in the second half. This outlook has been impacted recently by moderated market growth in Europe and effects from more challenging macroeconomic trends, including currency changes, constrained targeted emerging market gains. Consisting with this revenue outlook, we're refining our adjusted EPS guidance range for 2015 to $2.04 to $2.07 per share, including approximately $0.03 per share of headwind combined related to recent foreign currency rate changes in emerging markets as well as a 50-basis point higher estimate for our 2015 effective tax rate, reflecting updated regional profit mix projections also impacted by currency effects. Our 2015 reported EPS outlook will also incorporate the $0.06 per share impact from the software impairment charge. As noted, we'll be reviewing our preliminary guidance for 2016 today, which reflects targeted revenue of $1.715 billion to $1.735 billion and EPS of $2.09 to $2.16 per share. This outlook reflects expectations for continued solid operating performance, including normalized organic revenue growth of 8% to 9% and constant dollar operating margin improvement of 50 basis points, supporting 13% to 16% constant currency adjusted EPS growth. As noted in earlier reviews, meaningful FX headwinds will constrain reported financial gains in 2016. 2016 foreign exchange impacts include the lapping of $20 million in 2015 hedge gains, year-on-year effects from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar on revenue and profit growth and an additional 50-basis point increase in our effective tax rate driven by unfavorable profit mix impacts related to currency changes. Combined, these currency-related effects will lower reported operating margins and reduce 2016 EPS by about $0.21 per share. We'll discuss these impacts more detail as we review our 2016 preliminary guidance. Let's begin with the review of our Q3 performance by segment and region. Organic growth in Q3 continued to be driven by strong global CAG gains. Global CAG revenues were $344 million, reflecting 14% normalized organic growth. Our Water business also continued its solid revenue gains, increasing 7% organically to $26 million, reflecting solid existing and new business growth across major regions. Our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy business revenue was $30 million, up 6%, supported by gains in bovine, poultry and swine testing in Europe and emerging markets, including benefits from our new dairy pregnancy testing products. Overall, U.S. revenues were $252 million in the quarter, up 13% organically. U.S. gains were supported by very strong instrument revenues and 12% normalized CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth, reflecting continued strong growth in reference lab and instrument consumable sales as well as improved growth in rapid assay. IDEXX's performance continues to outpace solid U.S. veterinary practice market growth as reflected in our dataset from approximately 5,200 clinics. In Q3, this market level data showed patient visits increased 2% and clinic revenues increased 5.2%, each down about 1.5 points from strong H1 market growth trends. International revenues in the third quarter were $154 million, up 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong CAG growth, including the benefits of recent acquisitions. International CAG normalized organic growth was 14%, supported by very strong instrument placements and 9% normalized organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. Recurring CAG growth in Europe moderated in Q3, reflecting relatively softer patient traffic trends, impacted by the economy and unusually hot weather trends this summer. As noted, global instrument revenues were outstanding again this quarter, driving 54% organic growth in instrument revenues to $26 million. When the approximately $3 million benefit from recognition of differed revenue related to Catalyst One introductory offers is excluded, instrument revenues had Q3 organic growth of 37%. Strong premium instrument placement trends, including sustained high placement levels at competitive accounts in the U.S., are supporting continued growth of our instrument base globally. Of note, our U.S. premium instrument base continued to expand solidly this quarter, supporting 18% growth in our Catalyst installed base, net of estimated customer defections, in the U.S. over the last year. Jon will review our strong momentum in expanding our instrument base in more detail in his comments. Strong global placement gains set a foundation for continued solid gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. In Q3, global CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues were $290 million, up 11% organically. Instrument consumable revenues of $99 million grew 16% normalized in Q3 supported by a strong global volume gains and net benefits from U.S. margin capture. Consumable growth moderated somewhat from Q2, impacted by relatively lower growth in Europe compared to very strong Q2 levels. We also saw relatively moderated consumable growth in Q3, reflecting carryover impacts from heightened competitor placement activity in our U.S. customer base in Q4 of 2014 and the first half of 2015, which partially offset benefits from strong new customer placement gains and consistently solid same-store growth trends. While these effects from earlier competitor instrument placements will carryover and constrain consumable growth somewhat in Q4, our progress in driving continued strong competitive chemistry placements, while improving retention rates at existing Catalyst accounts, will allow us to continue to expand our installed base and position us for improved reported consumable growth dynamics through 2016. Our reference laboratory and consulting services modality, with revenues of $130 million, grew organically 10% in the second quarter (sic) [third quarter] (10:22), supported by 13% growth in the U.S., which offset moderated lab growth in Europe impacted by unfavorable weather trends, which constrained patient visits. We're targeting continued strong growth in lab revenues going forward, benefiting from a recently introduced SDMA test and fecal antigen panels. Rapid assay revenues increased 7% normalized in Q3 to $48 million, reflecting volume gains in SNAP 4Dx kits in the U.S., stabilized trends in first-generation products and benefits from U.S. margin capture. Jon will talk more about dynamics in this area in his comments. Combined information management and digital imaging system revenues increased 13% on a constant currency basis, supported by 9% organic gains and benefits from recent acquisitions. Our digital business posted modest reported gains despite solid growth in new placements, reflecting increased deferred revenues associated with bundled business commitments. We achieved 19% constant currency growth in information system revenues, reflecting benefits from our recent cloud-based PIMS acquisitions as well as strong organic growth supported by increased services being adopted by Cornerstone customers, including the expansion of Pet Health Network Pro, as well as new business gains in our Practice Intelligence business. Looking to build on this strong momentum, we refined elements of our information management strategy to support our enhanced cloud-based offerings and to streamline our approach in expanding our Practice Intelligence business. We're prioritizing investments in our strategy with the greatest return and have decided to discontinue certain development efforts for future commercialization, which were capitalized but not yet amortized in our P&L. This resulted in an $8 million pre-tax write-down of capitalized software assets. The prioritization we've advanced in our strategy will position us for accelerated revenue and profit in our information management business. In terms of P&L performance, we delivered solid results in the quarter despite continued FX headwinds, reflecting benefits from strong organic revenue growth and operating expense controls. Operating profit was $80 million, excluding the asset impairment. On a comparable basis, excluding this charge, currency changes and prior-year transition impacts associated with the implementation of the U.S. all-direct strategy, operating profits increased 10%. Operating margins were 19.7%, excluding the impairment charge, better than expected, reflecting benefits from cost management in the quarter. By segment, reported operating profit gains were driven by our CAG and Water businesses. Our Unallocated segment benefited from lower than budgeted spending in our corporate functions consistent with our cost management focus, as well as benefits from previously capitalized favorable variances, which reflected lower production costs. Gross profit was $224 million in Q3, up 5% on a reported basis. Gross profit margins were down modestly, primarily reflecting business mix impacts from very strong instrument sales, which offset benefits from lower product costs. Foreign exchange hedge gains reported in gross profit were $5 million or $0.04 per share in Q3. Operating expenses increased 6% in Q3, excluding the software impairment charge, reflecting increases in global commercial capability, including resources added in support of the U.S. all-direct sales model. Reported operating expense growth was moderated by impacts from foreign exchange. As noted, adjusted EPS, which excludes 2016 impairment charges of $0.06 per share, was $0.54 per share, up 2% from prior-year adjusted EPS or 9% adjusting for currency impacts. Prior-year adjusted EPS reflected adjustments for all-direct non-recurring transition costs of $0.03 per share and $0.02 per share non-recurring income tax benefit. Adjusted EPS growth benefited from share repurchases advanced over the last year, which reduced average share count year-on-year by about 8%. In Q3, we repurchased 1.2 million shares for $86 million. We ended the quarter with $1.14 billion in debt outstanding. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of EBITDA, adjusted to exclude transition impacts associated with the all-direct change and the impairment charge, were 2.92 times gross and 2.03 times net of $350 million in cash and investment balances at quarter-end; in line with our long-term target range. Looking ahead, we're refining our full year 2015 revenue and adjusted EPS outlook as noted to reflect revenue trends at the lower-end of our targeted guidance range as well as to corporate updated estimates for currency impacts in our 2015 effective tax rate. Our revised 2015 revenue guidance range is $1.595 billion to $1.605 billion; reflecting an outlook for approximately 11% normalized organic revenue growth. We expect continued solid organic revenue growth in Q4, supported by benefits from recent new test introductions, including our recently launched SDMA and fecal antigen tests in reference labs. At the exchange rates noted in our press release, we estimate the effects from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar will reduce 2015 revenue growth by approximately 6% and adjusted EPS by approximately $0.16 per share. The projected negative impact from FX changes in 2015 is relatively higher than our previous outlook, reflecting recent erosion in emerging market currencies relative to the dollar. Our 2015 profit outlook benefits from approximately $20 million in pre-tax foreign currency hedge gains from previously established contracts, which mitigate the 2015 profit impacts from the stronger dollar. This equates to approximately $0.15 per share after-tax EPS benefit. Our refined 2015 adjusted EPS outlook is $2.04 to $2.07, including a combined $0.03 per share impact from additional FX headwinds since the Q2 call and a higher estimated tax rate of approximately 30.5% for 2015. On a constant currency basis, the 2015 adjusted EPS outlook equates to 11% to 12% growth above 2014 adjusted EPS levels, which included approximately $0.03 per share benefit from the 2014 extension of the R&D tax credit. Reported EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.98 to $2.01, including the $8 million software impairment charge recorded in Q3. Aside from our updated effective tax rate estimate, other elements of our full year profit outlook for 2015 are basically consistent with our prior guidance. Please note that our 2015 tax rate and EPS outlook does not assume the further extension of the R&D tax credit, which has been renewed every year since 1997. Assuming renewal, we would expect an incremental EPS benefit of approximately $0.04 per share this year. We're maintaining our free cash flow outlook at 80% to 90% of net income, incorporating higher working capital levels associated with the U.S. all-direct transition and expectations for capital spending levels of approximately $100 million this year. As we finished 2015, we have solid growth momentum and a strong innovation pipeline that position us well to deliver continued strong operating performance as we move forward. Today, we're providing preliminary financial guidance for 2016. Our preliminary outlook is for revenue of $1.715 billion to $1.735 billion, reflecting targeted normalized organic revenue growth of 8% to 9%. Consistent with our strategic plan outlook, we're targeting 50 basis points of operating margin improvement on a constant currency basis in 2016, driven primarily by operating expense leverage. Please note that this outlook adjusts 2015 for the impairment charge. Strong cash flow generation will support continued capital allocation toward share repurchases, resulting in an estimated reduction of approximately 3.5% in our shares outstanding in 2016. We expect to maintain gross leverage levels of approximately 3 times EBITDA gross, and expect annual interest expense in the range of $31.5 million to $32.5 million in 2016. These drivers are reflected in our 2016 EPS outlook of $2.09 to $2.16 per share, which equates to 13% to 16% growth in adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. Foreign exchange impacts related to the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar will be a key variable impacting our financial outlook in 2016, given that 25% of IDEXX revenues are related to products manufactured in the U.S. for export. At the exchange rates outlined in the press release, foreign exchange rate changes will reduce reported year-on-year revenue growth in 2016 by approximately 1% and EPS by approximately $0.04 per share. As noted, the expiration of previously established hedging contracts, which benefited 2015 results through the recognition of hedge gains that mitigated near-term profit impacts will have the effect of increasing reported cost of goods sold in 2016 by approximately $20 million or about $0.15 per share. These FX impacts combined create approximately 150 basis points of operating margin pressure, which will offset our targeted 50 basis points in targeted constant currency operating margin improvement in 2016, resulting in a reported reduction in operating margins of approximately 100 basis points next year. Please note that these comparisons exclude margin impacts related to the impairment charge recorded in Q3. FX changes will also contribute to an increase in our effective tax rate to approximately 31%, net of benefits from ongoing tax planning initiatives, reflecting relatively lower profit mix in international regions with lower effective tax rates. Combined, we estimate that FX impacts will create approximately $0.21 of EPS headwind in 2016, reducing benefits from our targeted 13% to 16% constant currency growth in adjusted EPS next year. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the discussion over to Jon for his comments. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you, Brian, a little color commentary. We're pleased with the 12% normalized organic growth reported in Q3. The commercial teams around the world just did a stellar job with instrument placements. Total premium instrument placements globally were up 54% compared to Q3 2014, driven by 98% growth in Catalyst platform placements. In total, we placed 2,424 chemistry and hematology instruments, comprised of 1,325 Catalyst chemistry analyzers, 234 VetTest Chemistry units and 865 premium hematology placements. The premium hematology placement growth of 15% was driven entirely by the higher-end ProCyte analyzer, up 36% year-over-year. This past quarter was the highest premium instrument placement quarter for IDEXX globally on record, notably exceeding any prior fourth quarter, typically the strongest of the year. North America had an exceptional placement quarter of 1,026 chemistry and hematology units, accelerating 28% year-over-year and up 11% over Q2, which itself was up 15% over Q1. Of the 569 Catalyst placements in North America, 268 were to new or competitive accounts, up 16% year-over-year. Placement numbers were supported by customers augmenting their in-house lab capacity with a second Catalyst, as well as our continuing upgrades of our VetTest customers. International placements of Catalyst and hematology analyzers continue to set record numbers supported by highly successful launches in several Asian markets. International Catalyst placements at 756 instruments were up an amazing 169% over Q3 last year. Globally, competitive and new customer Catalyst placements were up 53% year-over-year versus Q3 2014. Obviously, it was an exceptional quarter for Catalyst One around the world. Our rapid assay performance was also very solid in Q3 with normalized revenue growth of 7%, including 6% in the U.S. We saw good growth in our all important U.S. canine vector-borne disease category in Q3 during the fall tick season, as U.S. SNAP 4DX kit volume growth, that's for in-clinic use, was 6% above last year's third quarter, bringing the volume growth to SNAP 4Dx kits positive year-to-date. Obviously, the revenues were much higher because of the price realization. Our 4Dx offering in the reference lab has also been growing, actually much faster, but on a smaller base. Our first-generation SNAP volume decline stabilized in Q2 and held steady in Q3 and continued to meet our expectation. We are now winning back as many feline SNAP customers as we are losing, a tribute to our superior accuracy in detecting infectious diseases and our U.S. commercial organization's ability to spread this important message and compete aggressively in the 2015 environment. We also continue to benefit from higher retention of rapid assay customers with SNAP Pro and SNAPshot Dx instruments. These customers contribute 61% of our U.S. rapid assay revenue base. Our U.S. lab business also continues to expand at a strong 13%, even though up against the tougher compare in Q3 of 2014, supported by our launch of SDMA. We now have three months of experience with the vertical adoption curve of SDMA in North America. In U.S. alone, we've provided results on about 1 million patient samples from over 12,000 accounts. This includes 1,600 accounts in the month of September that do not use IDEXX as their primary reference lab. With North American labs online with SDMA, we are proceeding with the rollout in our international labs, having begun to offer the test with full rollout of the automatic inclusion of SDMA in all chemistry panels to incur in early-2016 in most non-North American labs. As Brian mentioned, we achieved 19% constant currency growth in information management revenues. The revenue profile has now grown to 64% recurring revenues, up from 56% a year ago. These recurring revenues, which have high gross margin drop through, include software-as-a-service subscriptions, software maintenance fees and other recurring service and product revenues sold into the information management customer base. Profitability in the information management business is improving over time as a result. We continue to advance our Cornerstone practice information management software offering, which has a growing installed base of roughly 6,000 practices. A new version of Cornerstone fully launched in September and under development for more than a year provides further advances in usability, functionality and integration with IDEXX diagnostic solutions. Our portfolio of cloud-based software offerings continues to expand with the launch in September of Neo for the U.S. Neo is a highly innovative practice management system that follows a SaaS or software-as-a-service business model. We've been advancing Neo for a year, built off a cloud-based offering we acquired in Q4 of 2014. Neo has acclaimed ease-of-use and core functionality, all in an attractive monthly subscription price and little to no upfront cost to the customer. As a result, Neo becomes a highly effective cost-effective option for new and smaller practices looking to move to current cloud technology software and not needing the more advanced workflow functionality of Cornerstone. As to cloud-based technology, note that we have a clear lead in experience and scale as we have over 3,000 paying customer subscriptions of one of our five software-as-a-service offerings, a number that has more than doubled over the past year. And we continue to expect robust growth in customer subscriptions supported by the U.S. expansion of Neo and growing customer base for all of our cloud-based offerings. As to the product pipeline, we continue to track on the launch \u2013 with the launch of SediVue, our novel urine sediment analyzer in early-2016. This instrument and single-use consumable system provides an entirely new automated and highly accurate way to automate the in-house process of examining urine under a microscope. We expect an average unit price for the instrument in North America of around the high-teens in thousands of dollars and to place over a thousand analyzers in this market in 2016, although some placements will come through deferred revenue deals. Each instrument is expected to generate a new stream of consumable revenues averaging $3,000 to $6,000 (28:18) per year for IDEXX. We also expect the novel SediVue instrument to attract customers with competitive in-house lab equipment to IDEXX's integrated in-house lab, including Catalyst One Chemistry Analyzer. Our fecal SNAP product development continues to track nicely on schedule for a second half 2017 product launch. So, really, in summary, we have solid business trends, and we're now in the position to fully leverage our significantly enhanced U.S. and international direct sales capability and strong innovation pipeline to deliver continued strong performance, including the solid 8% to 9% normalized organic revenue growth in 2016 that Brian laid out. With this, we'll open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll go to the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Please go ahead. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Let me start with one on the 2016 growth outlook as it relates to your organic revenue growth. I guess I'm curious, number one : it looks like your competitive position is clearly improving, but maybe macro headwinds are increasing a bit more and offsetting some of that, so, anyway that you can talk about growth expectations in the U.S. and O-U.S. as we look at 2016? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I'd say, Ryan, thank you for the question. Our outlook is probably similar to where we are right now. We saw a 2% clinic patient visit growth in the U.S. We saw moderating patient clinic growth in Europe in Q3, some of that was weather, some of that was economy. So, that's kind of nothing special, but steady as you go macro market trends. Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : I think, Ryan, a couple of factors heading into next year to keep in mind. I think we'll \u2013 the trends that we're seeing in areas like rapid assay and (30:39), we feel great about. We will still be working through some anniversarying of effects of earlier inroads that will carry a bit into next year. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : In the U.S. Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : In the U.S., and I think that combined with some of the moderated trends that we've seen in places \u2013 international, some of that's currency driven, oil-based economy driven, I think combined lead us to have an outlook that's more consistent with our current growth rate, knowing that we will be kind of working through that. But I think our underlying operational foundation, we feel very good about the trajectory and the progress that we're making and, particularly, some of the innovation that we'll be bringing to market next year. So, we'll be looking to build on those growth rates. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then the follow-up would be, I guess, Brian, to your comment right there and you mentioned it in the prepared comments. I think you said your premium placements on a net basis are up 18%, but you're also indicating that the competitive displacements earlier are hitting you. So, can you go into a little bit more on that dynamic? Is it just a timing issue where the gains have been more recent? So, you've got to lap through that. I guess, still with the 18% improvement in the net base, it seems like a pretty strong growth outlook. Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah, just to clarify that. That is the estimated installed base for Catalyst in the U.S. net of changes. And so, we've actually \u2013 I know there has been a lot of questions around this, but we have year-over-year expanded the Catalyst base by 18% and, in fact, quarter-to-quarter we had a solid growth rate consistent with that trend. So, that's been an upward trajectory. I think the net effect, and Jon can enhance on this, is if you think about the growth rate in the business, things like consumables, we still have great new placements and we're growing the base and we have good same-store sales, but, obviously, there were earlier impacts for some competitor inroads that are slowing. And the net impact of that is in an annuity business that kind of plays in and kind of constrains your growth rate for a period of time, until you kind of work through the anniversarying effect. So net-net, we're expanding, we're growing at very good rates. Some of those impacts constrained our growth. We'll work through that and anniversary that, and we'll be positioned for improving growth as we move forward. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Ryan, as you know, the consumable growth in any quarter is the cumulative impact of your acquisitions, net of any customer losses for the prior four quarters. And we've had obviously very strong and, in fact, improving customer acquisitions as we laid out in the U.S. in this call. And we believe we've seen a moderating rate of defections, but that's on a kind of quarterly sequential basis. I think what's really happened here from IDEXX's perspective is that our new U.S. commercial organization, when you \u2013 which is about 300 professionals when you include the different types of field-based reps that are responsible for supporting the customer with diagnostics. That has really been seed \u2013 in seed now, in territory, they've gained those relationships, they've gained the experience. We expected that productivity of that group to improve over time. And I think you're seeing it with a growing number of instrument placements, really an extraordinary third quarter, and in improving customer retention levels as those relationships deepen in territory. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Sure. Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go to the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead. Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. And I want this question to be sort of polite, but maybe I just feel like I'm listening to little bit of a different call than when we were a couple of months ago. And I understand at the Analyst Day, there was a bigger emphasis on long-term and near-term. But still, you look at where we are today, you're bringing down numbers, you're bringing down numbers for maybe the second time in six or nine months. So, can you just take a step back and maybe walk us through, Jon, how 2015 has progressed and maybe what has changed versus internal expectations, where we were a couple of quarters ago and then, even more specifically to August, what's changed over those past eight weeks where there was a lot of go, go, go, we're on offensive not defensive and that seems to have taken a step back as of this morning. Thank you. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, thank you. I think, operationally, operational performance is consistent with where we believe we were. I don't think there's really any change. I think what's happened in the last couple of months has been further deterioration of currencies, particularly in emerging markets and those are markets where we don't hedge. It's not practical to hedge. And there has been a little bit of a macroeconomic slowdown, as we mentioned, with visits in Europe. But it's really the currency and the tax impact of the currency, which are the adjustments that we're talking about in 2015. And Jon, as you know, but I would remind everybody else, this call, the third quarter call in October of the year is when we typically provide guidance for 2016 for the first time. So, our guidance for the 2016 operation, I think, is entirely consistent with the long-term goals that we set. But I think now what we're providing to investors is an understanding of how currency and tax rate translates into the bottom line. Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And maybe just to follow-up a little bit there, can you talk to the lab \u2013 I know the 10.5% organic was off of a difficult comp, but it is the weakest number that we've seen in seven quarters. That's on the heels of SDMA, which you laid out as the biggest launch in the company's history. And we've done a lot of work there, I get it, nothing changes overnight. But can you talk to, was it in line with your expectations and then tie that back to the 2016 revenue growth, it is 200 \u2013 the midpoint of 8.5% is 250 bps below the midpoint of your long-term guidance. I'm a little surprised by the magnitude of that delta, considering SDMA going into 2016. Thanks guys. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, thank you. Now, the lab growth in the U.S. market was a very solid 13% off of even a strong compare of 2014. So, that was a very solid number. And, of course, it's really U.S. and Canada we've launched SDMA in July. We haven't yet launched SDMA internationally and, really, the number \u2013 our global lab numbers was brought down by the labs outside the U.S. and the labs were affected by the slower patient traffic and the weather trends in Europe, which brings that number down. But we continue to be \u2013 get absolutely positive feedback. I think the people who \u2013 the customers who are using SDMA are finding that it is extraordinarily valuable in the management \u2013 the diagnosis and management of their patients. And we have strong key opinion leader support globally for that. So, we continue to believe that's going to be a significant differentiator and driver for growth for us as we go forward. But, of course, we've got to launch it in the international markets and, I said, that won't happen until early-2016. Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. We will go to the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Jon, I guess, just going back to SDMA, you cited in your prepared remarks, I think, 15,000 customers in September that don't use IDEXX, wondering if you actually... Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Just 1,600. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): 1,600, sorry. Thanks for the clarification. Are you seeing any of these guys switching over and are you seeing \u2013 you do believe you're gaining some market share in the reference lab market? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I believe the 13% organic growth in the third quarter is indicative of the cumulative success that we're having in the reference lab modality. I think that's higher than the market growth. And if your growth is higher than the market growth for lab modality, then by definition you're gaining share. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Well, can you break that 13% out between volume or \u2013 volume and price? Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : It's primarily volume. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Volume? Thanks, Brian. And then... Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : As it has been, it's \u2013 a vast majority of it is volume and that's been consistent with the trends throughout the year. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Sure. And then just going to your competitive placements for Catalyst, I think you said it was 268 new competitive account, just wondering how that's tracking relative to your internal expectations. And can you talk a little bit and give us color on the overall competitive environment? Are vet practices more willing to swap out to Catalyst One and, of your placements, I guess, how many were Cat One versus other instruments? And I guess, what's your general outlook and feel for the market at this point? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it's always been and I think it will always be a very competitive market. I think our Catalyst One as demonstrated by a success around the world is a \u2013 it's a blockbuster product. It's a very cost-effective way to gain chemistry and it has really \u2013 it has capability that no competitive analyzer has in terms of menu, speed, and, of course, supported by information management integration uniquely two-way into the Practice Management software and VetConnect PLUS. And so, really, what we're seeing, I think, is our sales organization is improving in their ability to tell that story to competitive accounts. And that's why we've seen a tick-up every quarter over the course of these three quarters of 2015 with the new sales organization placed in competitive placement and an extraordinary number of total placements in the North American market. In addition, I think that the retention rates that we're seeing in our Catalyst installed base are improving. I also know, Kevin. that we really \u2013 that we entered Q4 with a very good backlog, larger than average, and an excellent order momentum early in the quarter, which are all generally \u2013 I think it's generally continuing to show signs that our sales organization and our innovation together will \u2013 is coming together nicely as per plan. I will also mention that as we launch SediVue, the level of excitement in the customer base on SediVue is off the charts, because it really addresses a need that customers have. And we believe that SediVue will help us continue with \u2013 not only provide a nice revenue stream in and of itself, but can help us continue to inspire customers to upgrade to more advanced technology that we offer with the Catalyst One and the in-house lab. And that would, of course, happen in 2016 \u2013 early \u2013 starting in early-2016 with the launch of SediVue. Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. First on organic growth guidance for 2016, the 8% to 9%, I just want to kind of get what you view normalized 2015 levels. I know there's a lot of puts and takes in 2015 with the margin recapture and the IDEXX deferral, IDEXX \u2013 excuse me \u2013 Catalyst One deferral adding about 50 bps. So, if you look at your 11% normalized organic growth in 2015, is that a \u2013 when you adjust for all those moving parts, is the 8% to 9% for 2016 an acceleration, in line, a deceleration? Just want to get better views of how you're looking at the end market for next year. Thanks. Brian P. McKeon - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer : Yeah, that's a great question. We stopped \u2013 the margin capture effects got so integrated with our business, Nick, we stopped breaking that out. But, roughly, it's probably about a 3% benefit this year, a bit below. I think we originally had about 3.5%, and I think that reflects the rapid assay grew a little slower than this year than we originally planned. So, I think, 3%, if you reduce the 11% that gets you to 8%. And then, if you're \u2013 we've got a 0.5-point benefit from the referral this year, so that would equate to roughly 7.5%. And so this would be an acceleration \u2013 a moderate acceleration, and I think that's reflective of some of the improving trends that we're seeing as well as the benefits from the innovation that we outlined at Analyst Day. And I just want to reinforce that we are going to be working through some of the anniversarying of some earlier impacts. And I think as we get through that, we will see the benefit of that in terms of the improved retention and how that helps our overall growth rate. So, we remain confident on our ability to drive towards higher growth and feel like we'll be on that trajectory as we work through next year. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Very helpful, Brian. And then, secondly, on emerging markets, I know you guys have some exposure in Brazil, and I think you got some stuff in Asia-Pacific, but maybe just if you wanted to call out one or two or three markets where you're seeing maybe more volatility than what you had anticipated? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, you've mentioned Brazil. Actually, our Brazilian team is doing a great job, but the real has just fallen out of bed and we don't hedge that. So, that's a case in point. We're also strong in certain Asian markets that had some currency, Russia is an example. And on the margin, these are just areas that are \u2013 that had some changes over the last three months that constrain our outlook for the year, although, we actually did pretty well in Q3 top line and bottom line considering. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's it for me. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. We'll go to the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. So, the first one is on the Catalyst placement to new accounts. I think the number in Q1 was 59% of Catalyst went to new accounts, I think in Q2 it was 61% \u2013 excuse me \u2013 Q1 59%, Q2 61%, and if I'm doing the simple math correctly, I think the number is 47% to new accounts for Catalyst in Q3. At face value, if you could just confirm those numbers are right, it would suggest to me that something might have changed competitively in North America this quarter. And can you just kind of walk me through if my math is right and what might've changed? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thank you. I believe the 47% is right, but I will also note that the number of competitive placements in Q3 over Q2 grew 15%, the absolute number. And so, you ask, well, how can the absolute number grow and the percentage went down, well, that's because we did a great job placing Catalyst. In addition to the 15% growth in new and competitive accounts, we placed Catalyst with our \u2013 the remaining VetTest installed base, well, that's certainly getting smaller and smaller. And we also had customers desire a second Catalyst; many of our larger customers who are growing their in-clinic volumes. And the nice thing about when we place a second Catalyst, we re-up that customer for a new five-year lease, which supports our retention. So, I think it's a good news story all the way around on an absolute basis, growth in competitive placements and on an absolute basis, an extraordinary growth in total placements. Meanwhile, the hematology platform continues to tick along with really good growth too. As I said, it was an extraordinary instrument placement quarter. And those are just the U.S. numbers. The international numbers with that 168% growth in Catalyst placements is really quite a strong number in terms of placement growth. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. And your competitor, last night, talked about two contracts in particular being up for contracts, one in the U.S., one outside the U.S., consisting of multiple hundreds of units of analyzers. I assume that those are your accounts today. Can you just comment perhaps on some of the moving parts that would go into a deal like this, and could you help us frame what type of impact we might see in out quarters? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We're very close to our major accounts. We're not aware of any accounts being in jeopardy of where we have the accounts and where we have the business. So, I think that's what important from investors' point of view. We have solid relationships with the corporate accounts that are embedded in our installed base. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay, great. And then, last question for me. On the new products, clearly, some of my checks came back positive on the contribution from new products with veterinarians in 2015, but \u2013 and I appreciate some of the color you provided on SediVue. Is there any way you could help us frame maybe a dollar impact? Some of my initial thoughts were maybe up to $40 million for SDMA and $20 million for SediVue. But can you maybe help us think about how the dollar amounts might trickle in and what you've embedded internally in your guidance for 2016? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, a couple of things on the instrument side. Obviously, we're going to be anniversarying very, very strong placements with Catalyst in 2016. So, Catalyst growth won't be contributing to instrument revenue growth in the same way in 2016 as it has in particular this quarter. But on the other hand, we'll be selling a new instrument SediVue and just to give you a little color of that flavor, we expect to place, certainly, over a thousand analyzers in the North American market in 2016 and the average unit price we expect to be in the high-teens of thousands of dollars. And then, as those instruments are placed, each instrument over time \u2013 once they're placed, we expect to generate $3,000 to $5,000 a year in consumable revenue, so you can run the numbers on. That's North America. Internationally, the launch will be a little later in the year and we'll update you in January when we got better feel for it. But, obviously, the material number is the North America launch. And as your research, I think, validated similar to ours the response to SediVue is really quite strong and every single customer is a greenfield customer for SediVue because we're replacing a manual method. On SDMA, again, the SDMA is a differentiator, a strong differentiator for the reference lab over time. As you know, but to remind others, we don't charge incrementally for SDMA in and of itself unless they're just getting it as an individual assay. We have automatically included in the reference lab panel. So, what we expect SDMA to do will to contribute to stronger \u2013 even stronger retention in our reference lab business and new customer acquisition, as well as some modest growth in utilization, because many customers are now telling us they have much stronger case to run, preventative care chemistry on their senior paths, because kidney disease is highly prevalent. In time one in three cats and one in 10 dogs succumb to the chronic kidney disease, and we've actually demonstrated that with our data of over a million data points now. If you look at it by age, it's tracking this very, very interesting data about how the prevalence of chronic kidney disease progresses with age. That's very compelling information. But any growth in utilization in the veterinary profession takes time. It's kind of a slow, but long-term growth factor for us. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We have now further questions in queue. I'll turn the conference back to Mr. Ayers for closing remarks. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : All right. Well, I want to thank everybody for joining the call and I know we have a number of employees on the call too. I just want to congratulate everybody on the advancements in our business that the team has delivered, the extraordinary rate of innovation that we're bringing, plus what is also in the pipeline. And big kudos, I don't know who to congratulate more, our U.S. commercial organization or our international commercial teams. They both had really, really strong performance. I think we're really seeing these teams seeded in territory now and really strengthening the relationship. And when you are direct \u2013 and we are direct in not only in North America, but in most developed international countries. There are things that you can do. You've got more control over your destiny and more opportunity to drive growth then when you don't have that advantage and we're really seeing that mature now in the performance in Q3 and we look forward to continuing have a dialog with investors about how that would translate into financials, which will translate into continuous growth in the shareholder value creation. Operator : Thank you. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : With that, we're concluding the call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, and ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for replay after 10 A.M. Eastern Time today until November 4 at midnight. You may access the AT&T playback service at any time by calling 1-800-475-6701 and entering the access code 369419. International participants may dial 1-320-365-3844.

We do appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back in the queue and if time permits, we'll be more than happy to take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Thanks, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our fourth-quarter and full-year 2015 results and provide an update on our financial outlook for 2016. We had a solid finish to 2015. We achieved 11% normalized organic growth in Q4 supported by 12.5% normalized growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues and continued strong gains in instrument placements. Recurring CAG growth improved from Q3 levels supported by gains in US rapid assay revenues and higher consumable growth rates in Europe. Our full-year normalized organic growth was 11.3% slightly above our expectations reflecting solid year-end performance. Full-year results were supported by 13% normalized organic growth in total CAG revenues, reflecting strong double-digit gains in both US and international markets. Full-year adjusted EPS was $2.11, above about the high end of our guidance range reflecting solid operating performance and $0.03 per share benefit from the permanent extension of the R&D tax credit. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS grew 14% in 2015. Our operating trend positions well to deliver strong constant currency revenue and EPS growth in 2016. Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results beginning with an overview of regional performance. In reviewing our results today, please note that we will be normalizing down year-on-year growth rates to adjust for transitional impacts related to our move to an all direct sales and distribution model in the US in the fourth quarter of 2014. This included a reduction in revenues of $25 million in Q4 2014 related to the elimination of product inventories held at distributors as well as cost associated with ramping of sales resources and one-time cost associated with the transition. We achieved solid organic growth in US and international regions in the fourth quarter, driven by improved CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains and strong growth in our water business. US revenues were $239 million, up 12% on an normalized organic basis. Gains were supported by 13% normalized organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Note that in the fourth quarter of 2014 we started selling some of our US kits and consumables direct in parallel with the year-end reduction of US distributor inventories. This resulted in approximately 1% of prior year growth benefit in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues from this accelerated margin capture, which we have not normalized for us. So our underlying Q4 2015 growth rate in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues improved solidly from Q3 levels. Recurring revenue gains were supported by continued strong double-digit growth in reference labs and consumable revenues as expected and solid gains in rapid assay sales. IDEXX performance outpaced strong US market growth in Q4 reflected in our dataset from approximately 5,200 clinics. In Q4, patient visits increased 3.7% and clinic revenues increased 7.1% compared to the prior-year period benefiting from strong growth trends in November and December. For the full year, our US revenues were $980 million. We achieved US normalized organic growth of 12% in 2015, driven by 13% normalized organic CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains. International revenues in the fourth quarter were $167 million reflecting 10% normalized organic growth. International results were supported by 12% normalized organic gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, reflecting strong and improved growth in consumable sales across major regions including Europe benefiting from record levels of new instrument placements. Full-year international revenues reached $622 million or 39% of total IDEXX revenues. Normalized organic growth of 10% and benefit from acquisitions were offset by foreign exchange rate changes resulting in a 2% reduction in reported international revenues for 2015. For the full year, international normalized CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues increased 11%, reflecting 9% growth in Europe, 15% gains in Asia-Pacific and 44% growth in Latin America. Turning to segment performance, our Q4 results benefited from very strong instrument placements. Global premium instrument placements increased 35% in Q4 supported by 61% growth in catalyst placements. Global instrument revenue of $29 million was up 28% organically year-on-year in Q4, including a modest 1% growth benefit from deferred revenue related to Catalyst One introductory offers. For the full year we placed 4,944 catalysts and 3,744 premium hematology analyzers globally representing growth of 59% and 17%, respectively, well ahead of our goals. Including VetTest placements in international markets, we placed 9,771 chemistry and hematology instruments in 2015, demonstrating significant benefits for our investments in our expanded global commercial capability. Strong premium instrument placement trends including continued high placement levels at competitive accounts in the U.S. in both chemistry and hematology are supporting continued expansion of our premium instrument base. We ended 2015 with an active installed base of approximate 20,000 catalysts and 21,500 premium hematology analyzers globally. Our U.S. premium instrument base expanded approximately 3% this quarter sequentially supporting 16% year-on-year growth in our Catalyst installed base net of estimated customer losses in the U.S. over the last year. Catalyst customers now account for 97% of our U.S. consumable revenue exclusive of corporate accounts.  Our hematology installed base also expanded solidly in the U.S. this year driven by 30% growth in ProCyte. Strong global placement gains set a foundation for continued solid gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. In Q4, global CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues were $277 million, up 12.5% normalized. Overall, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues reached $1.15 billion in 2015 or 72% of IDEXX revenue. CAG recurring annuity growth reflected solid gains across modalities. Reference laboratory and consulting services with revenues of $125 million grew 11% organically in the fourth quarter. Gains were supported by 13% volume-driven revenue growth in the U.S. compared to strong prior year growth rates and 7% gains in international markets. Instrument consumables revenue of $98 million in Q4 grew 16% organically when normalized for the prior year reduction in U.S. distributor inventories associated with the go direct transition. Please note that in Q4 2014 global consumer growth benefited by approximately 2% from accelerated U.S. margin capture associated with the go direct change. With this factored in, comparable growth in consumables increased by about 2% in the quarter from Q3 growth rates, reflecting continued solid growth in the U.S. and accelerated gains in international markets. As expected, U.S. consumer gains were moderated by carryover impacts from heightened competitor placement activity in our U.S. customer base in Q4 of 2014 and the first half of 2015 which partially offset benefits from new customer placement gains in 2015 and solid same-store growth trends. Rapid Assay revenues increased 9% normalized in Q4 to $39 million. Note that Q4 2014 Rapid Assay growth results also benefited by approximately 2% from accelerated margin capture reinforcing the solid underlying performance in the quarter. Q4 Rapid Assay performance was supported by volume gains in SNAP 4Dx kits in the U.S. continued stabilized trends in first generation products, and benefits from U.S. margin capture. Our results demonstrate our maturing commercial capability to support this segment and increased customer understanding of our superior test accuracy. As we look ahead to Q1, we expect Rapid Assay revenues overall to be relatively flat as we anniversary growth benefits from U.S. margin capture and work through relatively tougher comparisons early in 2016. Combined information management and digital imaging system revenues increased 6% on a constant currency basis supported by 5% organic gains and benefits from acquisitions. For the full year, combined information management and digital revenues reached $111 million supported by continued expansion of our cloud-based platforms and increased penetration of our information management service offerings. In Q4, information management revenues increased double-digits. We also continued to drive solid digital imaging system placements supported by our highly differentiated cloud-based platform. Consistent with recent quarters increased digital imaging system placements that were integrated with multi-year diagnostic business commitments which result in deferred revenues constrained overall Q4 growth. Our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy business revenue grew 2% organically in Q4 to $33 million as benefits from our expanded pregnancy testing and strong poultry and swine sales in emerging markets offset year-on-year declines in livestock services revenue in Australia. For the full year, our LPD revenues were $127 million down 10% on a reported basis as 2% organic growth was offset by negative impacts of foreign exchange rate changes.  Our water business revenues grew 10% organically in the fourth quarter reflecting worldwide increases in core product sales and benefits from the launch of our Quanti-Tray Sealer PLUS product. Q4 capped a strong year of performance in water reflecting solid underwriting market dynamics and benefits from commercial investments that drove new business gains across major regions.  For the full-year 2015, water business revenue reached \u2013 increased to $97 million, up 2% on a reported basis, supported by 8% organic growth, which offset foreign exchange rate pressures.  Turning to the P&L, gross profit was $218 million in Q4, up 20% on a reported basis reflecting comparisons to prior-year results impacted by the reduction of inventory held by distributors in advance of our transition to all direct sales and distribution model. This resulted in a one-time revenue reduction of $25 million with an associated negative one-time gross profit impact of $21 million. Adjusting for this impact, gross margins increased moderately year-on-year as lower product costs and benefits from moderate net price increases offset mix impacts from very strong instrument sales. Foreign exchange hedge gains reported in gross profit were $6 million or $0.05 per share in Q4. Operating profit in Q4 was $67 million. On a comparable basis, Q4 operating margins were down modestly compared to prior-year levels as expected reflecting year-on-year growth in global commercial expenses. For the full year, operating profit was $300 million or $308 million adjusted for the one-time software impairment charge reported in Q3. This reflects an operating margin of 19.2% including approximately 130 basis point of benefit from $20 million -- $21 million 2015 foreign exchange hedge gains. EPS in Q4 was $0.48 per share, up normally compared to prior-year adjusted EPS and up 9% adjusted for currency impacts. The permanent extension of the R&D tax credit added a $0.03 per share to EPS results, consistent with Q4 2014. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $2.11 and 2015 foreign exchange rate changes reduced revenue growth by 6%, operating profit by $21 million, net of $21 million in hedge gains and EPS by $0.16 per share. Despite these impacts, we delivered 6% growth in adjusted EPS or 14% growth in EPS on a constant currency basis, reflecting solid underlying operating performance and disciplined and substantial investment in the US fully direct model. Free cash flow was a $145 million for 2015 or 75% of net income. This equates to approximately 86% of net income adjusting for net working capital changes associated with the US go-direct change. Free cash flow was slightly lower than our expectations reflecting timing of year-end net tax payments, growth in volume commitment rental programs in international markets and relatively higher levels of inventory in support of new instrument and test platform launches. We\u2019re targeting free cash flow at 95% to 100% of net income in 2016.  Our strong cash flows have enabled continued allocation of capital towards share repurchases. We repurchased 1.3 million shares for $93 million during the quarter. In 2015, we repurchased nearly 5.7 million shares or about 6% of our diluted shares outstanding at the beginning of 2015 for $406 million.  We ended 2015 with $1.17 billion in debt outstanding. At year-end, we had $343 million in cash and investment balances and $276 million of borrowing capacity available under our recently expanded $850 million revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios is a multiple of EBITDA adjusted to exclude the impairment change with 2.95 times gross and 2.09 times net of cash and investment balances at year-end in line with our long-term target range.  Our solid finish to 2015 positions us well to deliver continued strong constant currency revenue and profit growth in 2016. Today, we are reinforcing our outlook for organic revenue growth and increasing our EPS outlook by $0.01 per share reflecting benefit from the permanent extension of the R&D tax credit and operational upsides, which more than offset additional headwinds related to the continued strengthening of the US dollar.  Foreign exchange impacts related to the significant strengthening of the US dollar will be key variable impacting our reported financial performance in 2016, given that approximately 25% of IDEXX\u2019s revenues are related to products manufactured in the US and sold in local and international currencies. We have updated our financial outlook to reflect more recent rate --exchange rates, which have weakened relative to the dollar since we issued our preliminary guidance. At the updated exchange rates outlined in our press release, we estimate that foreign exchange rate changes will reduce reported year-on-year revenue growth in 2016 by approximately 2.5% and EPS by approximately $0.26 per share, including impacts from the tapping of 21 million in 2015 hedge gains and a 50 basis point increase to our tax rate due to profit mix impacts.  In terms of revenue, our updated outlook is for reported 2016 revenue of 1.69 billion to 1.71 billion, 25 million lower than our preliminary guidance, driven entirely by the continued strengthening of the US dollar over the last three months. This outlook reflects consistent goals for 8% to 9% organic growth in 2016. Note that 2015 revenue growth benefited by about 0.5% from the recognition of deferred instrument revenues associated with our Catalyst One launch in the US. So our underlying targeted organic growth in 2016 equates to 8.5% to 9.5%, adjusted for this impact.  Growth will continue to be driven by our CAG business supported by targeted full-year growth of 8.5% to 9.5% in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. This reflects goals for sustained double-digit global reference lab gains, strong above market growth in consumable revenue, supported by our expanded instrument installed base and modest growth in rapid assay. We expect to see improvement in our CAG recurring revenue growth rates in the second half of 2016, as we work to carryover impacts from prior year competitive impacts and consumable and rapid assay revenues in the first half of the year and as we benefit from annualization of higher customer retention rates that we achieved in the second half of 2015.  While we\u2019re up against some challenging comparisons to very strong instrument placements in 2015, we are targeting solid gains in CAG instrument revenues as well, supported by the launch of SediVue and premium chemistry and hematology placements consistent with the record levels achieved in 2015.  In the US, our focus in 2016 will be on placements at new and competitive counts. As noted, lapping of deferred revenue benefits in 2015 will moderate reported instrument revenue gains for the year. For 2016, we\u2019re targeting sustained mid-to-high single digit revenue growth in our water business and mid-single digit gains in LPD, supported by continued expansion of our pregnancy franchise and growth in emerging markets. In terms of P&L metrics, consistent with our preliminary outlook, we\u2019re targeting approximately 50 basis points of operating margin improvement on a constant currency basis in 2016, supported by operating expense leverage. Please note that this outlook adjusts 2015 for the software impairment charge recorded in Q3.  Reported operating margins will be lower than prior year, driven entirely by foreign exchange impacts, including the lapping of hedge gains which will lower reported gross margins. Net of these impacts, we expect that operating margins for the full year 2016 will be 18% to 18.5%. As noted, free cash flow is projected at 95% to 100% of net income for 2016, consistent with our strategic plan outlook. Capital expenditures are estimated at approximately 90 million.  Strong cash flow generation will support continued capital allocation towards share repurchases, resulting in estimated reduction of approximately 3.5% to 4% in our shares outstanding. We expect to maintain gross leverage levels of approximately 3 times EBITDA and expect annual interest expense of 32 million in 2016.  Our full-year outlook reflects a projected effective tax rate of 30% to 30.5%, including benefits from the R&D tax credit. These drivers support a 2016 EPS outlook of $2.10 to $2.17 per share, which equates to 12% to 15% growth in adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. In terms of our entry rate heading into 2016, we expect Q1 normalized organic growth to be 8% to 9%. Note that Q1 includes an extra day due to leap year, which we estimate will -- helps Q1 growth by about 1%. Year-on-year foreign exchange changes, including the lapping of 4.5 million in prior hedge gains will be significant in Q1, resulting in a 3% reduction of reported revenue growth and nearly 8 million of headwind to operating profits.  These impacts as well as the lapping of the ramping of incremental commercial resources globally in 2015 will result in reported operating margins of approximately 250 basis points below prior year Q1 levels resulting in lower year-on-year reported operating profit and EPS levels in the quarter.  That concludes the financial overview. Let me turn the call over to Jon for his comments on our business performance and our areas of focus heading into 2016. Jon Ayers : Okay, thank you Brain. We were pleased with the continued progression of our growth globally in Q4 of 2015 as well as the progress in bringing first and only innovations to our market. Coming out of 2015 and all investments we have made, we are well positioned to achieve our financial goals in 2016. Certainly a highlight of our Q4 2015 performance was our record level of instrument placements globally that Brain reviewed including the 61% growth in catalyst placements in Q4 and 59% for the year. Another way to look at it, in 2015, globally we replaced more than twice as many catalysts as we placed in 2013. Q4 was the highest premium instrument placement quarter for IDEXX globally on record exceeding the quarter we just established in Q3. In the North American companion animal market, we achieved impressive results on a number of important metrics that we track. First, catalyst placements were at record levels of 694 units. Importantly, placements in new and competitive accounts grew to 395 units; up 37% over Q4 of 2014, which itself was a quarterly record. Hematology placements were strong too at 582 units, driven by ProCyte our higher-end platform. Second, early indications from an analysis of our US installed base shows that customer chemistry retention rates continued at their strong levels of Q3 of at least 97% annualized, if not slight further improvement. Third, the growth of the reference lab modality in the US continued at a strong 13% and was primarily volume led with about 2% attributed to price. Fourth, our rapid assay business in the US delivered strong results, our all-important SNAP 4Dx unit volumes continued to be up for the quarter and for the year. On top of that, we had a very strong double-digit growth in 4Dx in the lab for the year, which now is about 10% of volume of the SNAP test kits. First-generation rapid assay generation revenues and volumes continued in Q4 their trends from Q3 of volume and revenue stabilization. And in accordance with our expectation set early in the year. Fifth, the reach and frequency of customer visits by our veterinary diagnostic consultants reached record levels in Q4 of 2015 at over 48,000 visits, a quarterly total which is grown an average of 10% every quarter this year as we perfect the new sales model and territory management. Note that the 48,000 visits does not include customer visits from the other 123 field-based professionals that support our diagnostic recurring revenue in the US, including our instrument specialists and professional service veterinarians. Sixth, we saw record high percentage of our instrument kits and consumables purchased through our e-commerce channel at 57%. This is a world-class level for the US veterinary practice market when compared to other companies that sell direct, which is actually pretty amazing given we've only been at this for 13 months. When customers go online instead of calling us to submit their orders, this frees up our 75 inside sales professionals to focus their efforts on out bound calls and demand generation. In fact, our outbound call line increased nearly 20% from Q3 to Q4 when factor driving our continued good rapid assay performance. So this array of metrics provides objective evidence that our US fully direct sales organization including over 300 field-based diagnostic specialists, our phone-based employees and the use of other marketing channels including digital marketing are having greater and greater impact on growth of our diagnostic recurring revenues in the US. Given the highly profitable and durable nature of the CAG recurring annuity, this CAG recurring annuity, higher growth of these revenues from our expanded commercial capabilities yields a high incremental return on our investments. We are clearly maturing the fully direct organization with growing productivity and a presence that builds on customer relationship with every passing quarter. In international markets, we achieved a nice rebound in the growth of CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. In Europe, in Q4, specifically after a slow Q3, CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues were up 10% bringing the full-year to up 9%. As an interesting aside, our Brazilian business achieved 112% growth in the CAG in local currencies. Too bad it\u2019s such a small contributor to global performance. This shows that even in a tough macroeconomic, emerging markets like Brazil and China can show strong local currency growth when we have a capable local team and attractive pet healthcare market that is early in the adoption of the diagnostics. Regarding our SDMA roll-out, we now have over 13,000 US customers receiving results on 1.6 million tests run through the end of 2015. As of this month, we have launched SDMA in our reference lab chemistry profiles in more than ten countries globally including all of the major markets, positioning us for continued strong growth in global lab revenues for years to come. In the US, the number of accounts ordering SDMA that don\u2019t use us as their primary lab grew 34% year-over-year in December and the volume of their submissions grew 80%. Clearly the professional as a whole is beginning to appreciate how important a parameter SDMA is as a screening test for kidney disease. One final comment on SediVue before we open the call to Q&A. We were tremendously pleased with the customer reception we have received to-date regarding SediVue, our novel first and only urine sediment analyzer for use in the veterinary practice at the point of care. We are finding that SediVue intuitively appeals to a wide range of veterinary practices. And interestingly, customer interest level show little to no correlation to their current level of IDEXX diagnostic use in-house or reference lab. For this reason, we believe SediVue will not only provide an attractive revenue stream from instrument sales and patient runs, this novel point of care solution will also allows to introduce IDEXX's entire diagnostic offering to customers using competitive instruments and/or reference lab services. As we have indicated in the past, our 2016 guidance assumes we place 1,000 SediVue analyzers at an average unit price of $16,000 to $18,000 per instrument. Each placement will generate an annualized stream of recurring revenues using our innovative new pay-per-run pricing model of between $3,000 and $6,000. This month we began to build taking orders and building a backlog including at the North American Veterinary Conference last week, where the novel analyzer garnered a lot of attention. We are targeting customer revenue shipments against this backlog in April and do not expect to be capacity constrained in serving the market over the course of the year. In summary, key innovations such as Catalyst One, SDMA and SediVue are examples of how we are generating an attractive return on our R&D investment and commercial growth around the world. So with that, Cynthia, we\u2019ll open the call to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan Daniels : Yeah, good morning and thanks for all the color. Jon, maybe a quick question for you just on catalyst as we look towards 2016. I know you mentioned it got approved in Japan, so I guess two specific questions on that. One, when will that actually start shipping? And then number two, I know Japan is a pretty receptive market for new technology. So what kind of market opportunity is that as we look to kind of \u201816 and \u201817 in instrument placement? Jon Ayers : Yes, Japan is a diagnostic market that really is oriented towards in-house point of care real-time care and it\u2019s a market with significant opportunity because we probably have a lower share in Japan than any other market that I can think of. And of course Catalyst One is a blockbuster product that we've proven in virtually every other market around the world and we have a good organization, a direct organization in Japan that\u2019s in place for decades. So it's going to be a nice combination. We've also launched VetConnect PLUS in Japan which I think is highly appreciated by the Japanese veterinarians because they are very visually oriented. And so, we\u2019re excited about the growth opportunity in Japan for the next couple of years. Ryan Daniels : And do you have a data on when that will start shipping? Jon Ayers : They\u2019ll start shipping this quarter. Ryan Daniels : And maybe a follow-up on the financials just on Capex. I think you are guiding towards about $100 million as recently in October but it came in about $83 million. I think next year the guidance is only $90 million. So I'm curious if you're seeing any specific capital efficiency that\u2019s allowing you to trend that down and could drive stronger long-term free cash flow? Brian McKeon : Yeah we\u2019re always focused on that Ryan, I think this year part of that was just driven by kind of year-end privatization and also some carryover into \u2013 that\u2019s not unusual at year-end where project is going to carry over into the next year and that's all factored into our $90 million outlook. I think our numbers is still probably a little higher than they normally would be just reflecting the very strong volume growth that we\u2019ve had in reference lab as well as some of the work we're doing on enhancing our manufacturing capability with new products but I think we\u2019re \u2013 our long-term outlook would be and our focus would be on continuing to drive capital efficiency. So we think that can be a point of leverage for us over time. Ryan Daniels : Okay, thanks I\u2019ll humpback in the queue. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of John Block with Stifel. Your line is open. John Block : Great thanks and good morning. Jon, maybe just first one on international CAG, you sort of laid it out that it was choppy last quarter and it seemed to improve this quarter. But oddly enough there is some orders that are calling out some international weakness in calendar 4Q. So, maybe just walk us through how you see the international market unfolding now that you have entered 2016 and just your level of conviction at the worst is behind you there? Jon Ayers : Yes, thank you for the question. The weakness that we saw specifically was the deceleration in recurring revenue growth in Europe; obviously in international markets we've had extraordinary level of growth in Catalyst One placements including Europe. And that varied same quarter of Q3 I think, we had 169% year-over-year growth in catalyst platform placements internationally. And so we hypothesized in Q3 that was related to very hot weather in markets that don\u2019t traditionally have air-conditioning, believe it or not, that\u2019s Continental Europe. And it was nice to see the rebound to 10% recurring CAG diagnostic revenue growth in Europe. Other markets around the world I think have just been very strong. I mentioned Brazil, Asia is very strong and so I think we have the combination of investments we\u2019ve made in a direct and strong commercial organization for the last years internationally combined with new innovative market leading products such Catalyst One. VetConnect PLUS is now - I think we have customers using VetConnect PLUS in 60 countries and of course now the global rollout of estimate for our reference lab modality which gives us confidence that we will continue to have above US growth in the international markets in part because they are simply far less mature in their - not that US is mature, but they are just so much earlier than the US in their adoption of diagnostic protocols for pet healthcare. John Block : Got it, very helpful. And then just on guidance and I just find my opinion, but I find the two set of ways that you call that an operations on a $2 plus number, just a little bizarre at this stage of the year considering the events of last year. So can you just talk to your confidence that this isn\u2019t going to be sort of the one step forward, two steps back in terms of the guidance and maybe tell us why you decided not to just keep some dry powder in case the environment gets even more competitive as the year progresses? Thanks guys. Jon Ayers : Yes, John, thank you for that question. What a difference a year makes. I think we're not entering a huge disruptive change. We are beyond that disruptive change and we are seeing the progression and productive of our commercial investments in the US and internationally. We expect to get productivity on those investments and operating expense leverage particularly in the US market in 2016. So we don\u2019t enter the year with the kind of risks that we entered last year. The only think I can\u2019t really comment on is macro, but out underlying markets are very strong, so it's more of an issue of currency and those kinds of things. Brian McKeon : Yeah, John, just to highlight, the adjustment is entirely related to we had better than expected operating margins finishing the year in Q4 through good cost management. So we\u2019re basically just flowing that through. We are still targeting 50 basis points of constant currency improvement and really all you are seeing is that we had a very good cost management at the end of the year and we are flowing that through and driving toward the same objectives we talked about earlier. It\u2019s actually not an increase in our revenue outlook. We maintain a consistent - Jon Ayers : The 89% organic growth is consistent with the guidance in October. John Block : I appreciate it guys. Thanks. Jon Ayers : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go to the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffrey. Your line is open. Kevin Ellich : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, just a couple in the reference lab business. So the 13% growth in the US was pretty strong I guess. Could you quantify or break down how much of that\u2019s coming from share gains and I guess how much is coming from vets ordering more tests per requisition. Obviously you are getting great traction with SDMA. And I guess kind of following upon that as well, how much of the growth from SDMA is coming from non-IDEXX customers? Jon, I think you might have mentioned that. Jon Ayers : Yes, thank you. Well, of course vast majority of our customer does come from continuing \u2013 revenues does come from continuing customers. So I think what we're pleased with the non-customers is that the growth in sending us panels is demonstrating that they are voting with their feet and seeing SDMA as an attractive addition, but those numbers are small contributors to overall reference lab growth. Getting back to the first part of your question, I think that the trends are balanced between net new account acquisitions and same-store sales account from existing customers who are adopting more and more of our unique menu innovations such as fecal antigen and some of the other tests that we offer. And in some cases we may have a core customer who is using us as their primary reference lab, but maybe not using us entirely. And so with the value that SDMA brings to the core chemistry panel perhaps, they are shifting more of their \u2013 what they may have been splitting more their chemistry volume to us. And of course we have net new customer acquisitions which is also contributing to that growth. [Indiscernible], I mean continued strong retention metrics and new customer acquisition exceeding whatever customer losses that we're seeing. Kevin Ellich : That's helpful. And then just one follow-up. Brian, I think in your prepared remarks you made a comment that in Q1 you expect rapid assay to be flat. Can you go over what\u2019s driving that again? I think you said tough comps and analyzing the margin capture? Brian McKeon : Right, I think we obviously don\u2019t get the benefit of the margin capture as we move into 2016. And so it is really reflecting that we will have some compares from some of the losses in the first generation product that have stabilized. Jon Ayers : Which occurred over the course of Q1 and Q2 of last year, so we have to anniversary those. Brian McKeon : But I would highlight, it\u2019s kind of a solid positive projection in rapid assay that we're seeing and it reflects that from we had some headwinds here that we've been sequentially improving in terms of the performance with very good growth in the 4Dx business and we're going to be working through some of these compares and that will contribute to relatively flat performance in Q1. Kevin Ellich : Right. And then I guess one last one. Did you guys give any stats out on Cornerstone in terms of the numbers of users or anything like that? Jon Ayers : No, but we are happy to. We have a highly loyal Cornerstone and DVMAX is our client server platform, about 7,000 customers. I think the loyalty in that customer base is 99% plus. We continue to invest in those platforms, but our focus on new customer placements will be with Neo, our cloud-based platform which is unique in not only its ease of use, but the fact that it has virtually zero upfront cost for customer to start using consistent with cloud technology and it has full integration into our diagnostic ecosystem. And so that will be a small but because of we don't get upfront revenues, the same \u2013 the customers don\u2019t have upfront cost, but a growing contributor to our installed base building on top of the high loyalty we have with Catalyst and DVMAX customers. It\u2019s interesting if you look at the information management and digital revenues that product line that we report actually at this point a little over 50% of those revenues are what we consider recurring revenues. There are kinds of things like subscriptions and maintenance and add-on services and the rest is things like hardware and supply sales, they are not what we call non-recurring, they are not capital per se, but they are hardware and supplies and our data business. Very good performance in 2015 and we are well positioned in 2016 to build out our cloud-based customer adoption through our five or six cloud-based offerings in that segment. Kevin Ellich : Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Mark Massaro : Hey, guys, thanks and congrats on a nice quarter. So I think Neo has rolled out now in January and can you help us to understand what the impact will be on the digital imaging business as presumably more people will order the subscription based Neo as opposed to the more capital intensive cornerstone. So can you just help us understand the impact as we look at our model for Q1, Q2 throughout 2016? Jon Ayers : Well, the growth in that segment is going to come from not only Neo, which really won\u2019t be a large element that will be a growing and strategically important element, but we are also growing the adoption of add-on services, primarily cloud-based incremental services to our Cornerstone and DVMAX install base as well as continued growth in our digital radiography, including the cloud-based software that supports and stores all the images on cloud, and one needs to have a local server and backup and all that just the radiography system fully integrated with Cornerstone and with Neo. So it\u2019s really both the continued growth and continued replacements, but more importantly the growth in the recurring revenues Neo and these add-on services to the existing install base that will propel profitable growth in that line of business in 2016. Mark Massaro : Great, thanks. And on SediVue, I think at the conference last week, you \u2013 I think you mentioned that SediVue would sell for $20,000, is that the list price, because today I think you said 16 to 18? Is the 16 to 18 more your expectations for an average sale price? And when you take the midpoint of the recurring stream that you provided today and thank you for that color, would get me to somewhere around $21.5 million incremental for \u201916 from SediVue? Any clarification there would be helpful. Brian McKeon : Yes, let\u2019s just a latter point, I think we can all do the math, I can\u2019t \u2013 you can take 16 to 18 in times of by a 1000 and that\u2019s pretty easy because $16 million to $18 million and then the incremental value as that install base grows, obviously you got pricing analyzers and they got to start using it in order to generate the recurring revenue of the pay by run. We are selling the analyzer at 19, 9, 95, but in cases that we are selling it in a bundle with other equipment to competitive accounts, when they are buying, they are looking at SediVue and then they are saying, hey, this is a new look at IDEXX and I see the benefits of IDEXX and fully integrated approach and all the key differentiators, now I\u2019m looking at SediVue for catalyst and hematology. When we put on our bundle, we will have a lower unit price associated with the SediVue placement and in some cases, some deferred revenue. So that\u2019s really what brings down \u2013 we are selling it at list price, because it\u2019s our first and only innovation and customers are so excited about it, we have no pushback on that. But the average unit price will come down. And then we will have some sales in the latter part of the year that will be international and will probably at lower AUP, so those are things that bring down the average unit price from the list price. Mark Massaro : Great, that\u2019s very helpful. And last question for me. Thanks for commenting on the annualized 97% customer retention rate. Would you say that\u2019s modestly ticked up, I know you have called out some stability, say in Rapid Test. But I don\u2019t recall you providing that number in the last couple of quarters. I know it\u2019s in line with your historical numbers, call it 96% to 99% customer retention. But can you just help us understand if that has ticked up at least modestly in the last couple of quarters? Jon Ayers : It definitely ticked up in Q3. We saw big, a nice tick up in Q3 from \u2013 in fact it\u2019s on \u2013 as we look the annualized retention rate by quarter, it turns out that fourth quarter 2014 was our most challenging quarter. And every quarter since then the annualized retention rate for that quarter has ticked up and it ticked up to about 97% in Q3, and what I will say is, sometimes it just takes us a little while to absolutely solidify that number. Early indications are for Q4 as we sit here four weeks into 2016 because it takes time to see the dust settle and look at customer ordering patterns to really be secure. But certainly the early indications are that we were \u2013 we maintain if not a slight improvement in that metric in Q4 2015. Mark Massaro : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Jansen with Raymond James. Your line is open. Nick Jansen : Hi, guys, nice job finishing the year. Just wanted to better understand Brian, maybe the moving parts for the first quarter. I think you guys reported a 11.1% organic growth in the fourth quarter when you addressed for the distribution dynamic in the prior year and I think if I heard you correctly, you are saying 8% to 9% for the first quarter, but that includes kind of 100 basis point benefit from leap year. And you have had a lot of moving parts in terms of share erosion and things along those lines. So can you perhaps maybe bridge the delta from that 11.1% normalize to let\u2019s call it a core 7% to 8%? And then how we get the ramp for the balance of 2016, I assume SediVue and others are built into that. But it will be helpful to better understand the mechanics of the guidance is, I think investors are still trying to figure out all the moving pieces given the variety of moving parts that we have seen over the last five quarters. Thanks. Brian McKeon : Sure. I think one of the key elements in the bridge is you have to recognize if the 11% in Q4 benefited from margin capture, right, so you have to \u2013 comparing that Q1, you have to normalize for that. So basically that\u2019s in a range of 3%. We don\u2019t quantify that specifically anymore. But say we are at an 8% level and we are effectively saying 8 to 9 or 7 to 8 adjusting for leap year. And so it\u2019s largely consistent trends. We did have really strong instrument revenue growth year-on-year in Q4, so that\u2019s obviously benefiting us. I think we are targeting continued solid progress on recurring CAG growth and improvement as we work through the year as we \u2013 Jon highlighted these improved retention rates and working \u2013 Jon Ayers : For the Chemistry customer base. Brian McKeon : The consumables and for also the rapid assay kind of working through the headwinds there and getting to a place where we are growing versus down on a margin, excluding margin capture, we had some headwinds, of course, this year from the first generation losses. So those things will benefit us as we work through the year and we\u2019re basically projecting Q1 for another strong quarter. Nick Jansen : That's very helpful. And then secondly, I've always assumed that, let's call it, the churn rate, at least in North America of instruments is like a 5 to 7 year cycle where you\u2019re not necessarily. Once you buy one, you\u2019re going to be working with it for a while. Have you seen that change over the years? It just seems like the interest rate numbers that obviously you guys are poising are quite strong and even some of your competitors certainly not as strong, but still are poising a fair amount of instruments. I'm just trying to get a sense of how easy is it for a customer to say, I'm going to use catalyst this year and then next couple of quarters, the distributor comes in and they switch to Abaxis or a competing machine. Has there been any change in kind of the churn, because it feels like there has been, but I can't fully grasp it? Thank you. Jon Ayers : Yes. Thank you. I think the instrument placement is pretty sticky as evidenced by our estimate of 97% retention on an annualized basis. And so that will be 3% of customers who are in our installed base, as measured by the revenue that they are contributing, the consumable revenue that they are contributing are switching to different analyzer. That is, what I call a very, very sticky and loyal installed base and I think in the case of IDEXX, that\u2019s because they\u2019ve adopted elements of our in-house lab whether it be advanced 2a integration or unique menu or the benefit of real-time care or VetConnect PLUS integrated with the reference lab results. Also, of course, when they purchase an analyzer, they typically buy it either in a six-year lease or some kind of a contractual commitment, multi-year contractual commitment, which also adds to the stickiness. So it is not, it's a very sticky installed base to answer your question. Nick Jansen : Thanks for the color. Nice job. Jon Ayers : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ben Haynor with Feltl & Co. Your line is open. Ben Haynor : Good morning, gentlemen. Sorry if I missed it, but did you give the visit and revenue growth? Jon Ayers : Yes. Brian McKeon : The market growth? Ben Haynor : Correct. Brian McKeon : Yes. No. We did. Q4 patient visits increased 3.7% and clinic revenues increased 7.1%. Jon Ayers : So that was a very strong number. That number can bounce around from quarter to quarter. I think we saw one quarter since the Great Recession that was higher than that, but certainly I would suggest that the underlying market trends are robust. Ben Haynor : And then secondly, for me, are you seeing competitors become more aggressive at all on equipment pricing in North America? Jon Ayers : I would say that it\u2019s always a very competitive environment. And I think the difference in terms of IDEXX is that customers value unique aspects of what our solutions provide that they cannot get from others. And so if something is lower price but does not provide an adequate solution, that isn\u2019t going to be something that customers like to do. In addition, I mentioned \u2013 our veterinary diagnostic consultants are really now covering the market, you think of 48,000 visits in a quarter, they are basically covering the market price over on average.  And so our reach and frequency into the customer and that's just with our veterinary diagnostic consultants, which are around 180, we have another 120 other types of field-based professionals that are also visiting customers, we are present. We have those relationships and I think customers value those businesses, because we are bringing value, both in terms of support and new innovation. And so always a very competitive market. But we win with a combination of innovation, new and unique personal innovations and a very strong commercial presence. Ben Haynor : Great. That makes sense. Thank you very much gentlemen. Jon Ayers : Thank you. Operator : And with that Mr. Ayers, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments. Jon Ayers : Yes. Thank you, Cynthia and thank you everyone for joining the call. I just want to also, a very special callout to IDEXX employees, our 6000+ employees who\u2019ve worked really hard this year or last year, should I say, 2015, in the phase of a lot of competitive and macro challenges to deliver what I think was a very strong finish to the year. A special callout to our North American Field organization that has really done a great job in coming online with new territories and establishing customer relationships and bringing value and growing the level of care that our customers are providing to pet owners.  This is a very satisfying outcome for all of us at IDEXX, when we see this kind of growth that we\u2019re driving and we\u2019re seeing care providers being successful, both medically and economically, and pet owners benefiting with improved health of their pets. And so it really gives us confidence that we\u2019re on the right strategy for sustained growth for years to come with the investments we've made in 2015, both in the US and around the world.  And with that, we will conclude the call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, today's conference call will be available for replay after 10 :30 A.M. today until midnight February 5.

McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Good morning. IDEXX had a strong start to 2016 in Q1. Based on our solid performance trends and more favorable projections for foreign exchange rates, we are increasing our full year financial outlook today. In terms of first quarter highlights, we achieved organic revenue growth of 11%, supported by 10% organic growth in the U.S. and 12% organic revenue gains in international markets. Recurring CAG Diagnostics revenues increased 11% organically as benefits from our innovation pipeline and strength in commercial capability supported 15% gains in reference lab revenues and 12% consumable revenue growth globally. We had another strong quarter in terms of expanding our instrument base with nearly 2,000 premium analyzers placed globally, up 18% from strong prior year levels. Strong top-line growth and better-than-expected operating margin performance supported Q1 EPS of $0.51. On a constant dollar basis, Q1 EPS increased 14%. As expected, foreign exchange was a headwind to reported results, lowering reported revenue growth by 2% and EPS by $0.05 per share, including the impacts from the lapping of 2015 hedge gains. Foreign currency rates strengthened relative to the U.S. dollar during Q1. Compared to our earlier estimates of exchange rates shared in our January earnings call, this change added about $5 million to Q1 revenue and about $0.01 to EPS. For the full year 2016, at new exchange rate assumptions shown in our press release, the recent strengthening of foreign currency rates relative to dollar will add approximately $27 million to 2016 revenue and $0.05 to EPS. Along with our stronger-than-expected operational performance, this supported an increase in our full-year revenue and EPS guidance of $40 million and $0.08 per share, respectively. We'll review our updated 2016 outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our Q1 performance by segment and region. Q1 results were supported by strong CAG results and accelerated growth in our Water business. Global CAG revenues were $358 million reflecting 11% organic growth. CAG gains were supported by strong recurring Diagnostic gains across the U.S., Canada, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. As expected, we saw approximately 1% of growth benefit from extra days in the quarter. Favorable U.S. weather comparisons also supported strong CAG performance. Our Water business grew 11% organically to $24 million supported by double-digit gains in the U.S. and benefits from global commercial investments. Water results also benefited from the extra leap year day and warmer U.S. weather. Our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy business grew 4% organically to $31 million benefiting from new product gains, porcine and poultry testing in China, and livestock services testing offsetting expected declines in Western Europe bovine testing associated with successful disease eradication programs. Overall, U.S. revenues were $259 million in the quarter, up 10%. U.S. CAG recurring diagnostic revenues grew 9% organically supported by high-single-digit consumable volume gains and high-teen revenue growth in our U.S. Lab business. Recurring CAG revenue gains continue to be primarily volume-driven. Consistent with trends in Q4 of 2015, we continue to see a moderation of growth in net customer acquisition cost, reflecting our success in differentiating IDEXX's diagnostic technologies from competitive offerings, which should provide benefits to realized net pricing levels moving forward. U.S. market growth reflected in our data set of 5,200 clinics continues to trend solidly. In Q1, patient visits normalized per equivalent days increased 6.0%, and clinic revenues increased 9.2% overall, supported by double-digit gains in February. International revenues in the first quarter were $159 million, reflecting 12% organic growth. CAG Diagnostic's recurring revenue growth was 13% in international markets in Q1. These strong results reflect accelerating consumable revenue growth supported by high levels of instrument placements as well as improved lab revenue gains. Global instrument revenues for IDEXX were $23 million, up 16% organically, supported by continued strong growth in premium instrument placements globally, particularly Catalyst One. Globally, we placed 1,157 catalysts and 823 premium hematology analyzers, up 25% and 10%, respectively compared to strong prior-year results. International performance was exceptional, reflected in 1,150 premium instrument placements, up 28% over prior year levels. In North America, we placed 443 catalysts in total with 258 or 58% going to new and competitive accounts, reflecting our commercial emphasis. These gains and continued improvement in placement retention supported a 15% expansion of our U.S. catalyst instrument base over prior year levels. Strong placement gains continue to expand our foundation for growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Global CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues were $305 million in Q1, up 11% organically. By modality, instrument consumable revenues of $108 million grew 12% organically, reflecting strong volume-driven gains across all major regions. Our reference laboratory and consulting services modality with revenues of $141 million grew 15% organically in the first quarter, driven by very strong U.S. gains and improved performance in Western Europe. Strong global lab momentum reflects leverage of our expanded commercial capability and benefits from our test menu expansion including SDMA. Rapid assay revenues decreased 1% organically in Q1 to $43 million. As expected, U.S. Rapid assay revenues were down modestly, reflecting timing of promotional programs and relatively tougher prior-year comparisons. Rapid assay trends over the past two quarters have remained basically consistent with sustained 4Dx volumes and stabilized impacts from competitive first-generation assay products. Customer information management and digital imaging system revenues were $29 million in the quarter, up 14% organically. Solid information management revenue gains were supported by continued penetration of the Cornerstone services in our loyal installed base as we, in parallel, advanced the introduction of our cloud-based Neo platform. Digital revenue growth continued to improve reflecting strong unit sales and benefits from recognition of deferred revenues associated with long-term business commitments. Turning to the P&L, as expected, the lapping of $4.5 million in 2015 hedge gains and unfavorable year-on-year changes in foreign exchange rates had a moderating impact on a reported first quarter financial results. Despite these headwinds, we delivered solid financial performance in the quarter. Operating profit was $74 million, up 1% compared to the prior year, supported by gains in our CAG segment, which offset FX effects. Please note that our segment reporting now includes a more comprehensive view of the financial performance of our operating segments by including the capitalization of manufacturing variances in operating segment results. These impacts were previously disclosed in unallocated amounts. Excluding currency impacts, operating profits increased 10%, supported by strong revenue gains. Operating margins of 17.7% were better than expected due to volume leverage and timing of operating expenses, which moderated cost growth in Q1. Gross profit was $228 million in Q1, up 6% on a reported basis. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, including the lapping of prior year hedge gains, gross profit margins declined approximately 70 basis points, reflecting comparisons to favorable prior year product costs and product mix impacts from higher instrument sales. For 2016, we had a foreign exchange hedge gain reported in gross profit of approximately $800,000 in Q1. Operating expenses increased 8% in Q1, modestly below revenue growth, reflecting increases in capabilities supporting the U.S. go-direct strategy and global increases in commercial spending advanced through 2015. As noted, EPS was $0.51 per share, up 4% on a reported basis and 14% adjusted for currency impacts. The federal R&D tax credit, which benefited 2016 but not 2015 first quarter results, had a favorable 2% EPS growth impact. EPS growth continues to benefit from share repurchases advanced over the last year, supported by our strong free cash flow and optimization of our capital structure, which reduced the average share count year-on-year by approximately 5%. In Q1, we repurchased over 700,000 shares for $50 million. Absolute levels of share repurchases moderated in Q1 from accelerated levels in recent years as we've achieved debt leverage ratios within our long-term target range. We ended Q1 with approximately $1.2 billion in debt outstanding with an average interest rate of 2.5% and a balanced multiyear tenor. Cash and investment balances were $351 million at quarter-end. Looking ahead, we're updating our full year guidance today to reflect our strong start to 2016 and favorable changes to foreign exchange rates. We're increasing our 2016 revenue guidance range to $1.73 billion to $1.75 billion, an increase of $40 million. As noted, we're raising our 2016 organic growth guidance to 9% to 10%. We're also incorporating updated FX rates in our outlook, which contributed approximately $27 million to our full year revenue guidance. At the updated exchange rates outlined in our press release, we now estimate that foreign exchange rates will reduce year-on-year revenue growth in 2016 by approximately 1%. We're raising our EPS outlook range by $0.08 to $2.18 to $2.25, reflecting closure benefits from higher organic revenue growth and FX changes, offset by a 50-basis-point increase in our expected tax rate. The increase in our effective tax rate estimate to 30.5% to 31% reflects updated estimates for higher U.S. profit growth. In terms of FX impacts at updated exchange rates, we now estimate that foreign exchange will reduce 2016 EPS by approximately $0.21 per share, including net impacts from the lapping of $21 million in 2015 hedge gains, compared to projected hedge gains of approximately $2 million in 2016. We're maintaining our outlook for strong cash flow generation of 95% to 100% of net income this year. For Q2, we reported revenue gains of 7.5% to 8.5% supported by organic growth of 8% to 9%. In addition to expectations for continued strong CAG recurring diagnostic gains, benefits from the launch of SediVue will mitigate effects from comparisons to very strong prior year instrument placement results. In terms of the P&L, we expect that operating margins will be approximately 150 basis points to 200 basis points below prior Q2 levels, reflecting impacts from FX operating profit headwinds of approximately $7 million, including the lapping of $5 million and 2015 foreign exchange hedge gains and timing of 2016 operating expenses. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the discussion over to Jon for his comments. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you, Brian. Q1 performance was outstanding and was a result of a combination of factors. First, we achieved strong performance in our commercial organizations in the U.S. and around the world. Second, we are seeing the sustained benefits of a highly innovative line of veterinary diagnostics. Finally, we are seeing generally, favorable market trends, particularly in the U.S. As we exited the fourth quarter of 2015 with revenue and profit performance that built from Q3 results, I think most concluded that we had indeed successfully completed the transition in the U.S. to our fully direct sales model. With these Q1 results and our revised 2016 organic growth guidance, we are now beginning to see the power of this new sales model and what it can achieve. We went fully direct because we believe that by being closer to our customers, we could augment revenue growth and adoption of our first and only innovations in the veterinary market. This has been our strategic plan executed over several years, not only in the U.S., but in markets around the world. It's very simple. The more IDEXX representatives as subject matter experts in our category visit customers, the faster our customers grow their adoption and use of IDEXX's unique and innovative solutions. So, let's look at a few numbers. In Q1 of 2016 in the U.S., we made nearly 63,000 field visits to veterinary practices, up 31% year-over-year. 23% of this growth came from productivity in the form of more visits per field representative, and the remainder was a consequence of more feet on the street year-over-year. This visit rate is higher than I quoted in Q4 2015 and it includes not only our 180-plus veterinary diagnostic consultants, but also other types of Companion Animal Group diagnostic rules in our field organization, namely our highly-experienced professional service veterinarians and their wonderful team of field support representatives. As there are roughly 25,000 veterinary practice locations in the U.S., 63,000 visits is an average of more than 2.5 visits per practice in a quarter or 10 per year. And this number does not include a variety of other ways we interact with customers, including trade shows, group educational dinners, online education, phone sales and support, corporate account interactions and sales roles in information management and digital radiography that are part of the field team activities. We are finding that when we show up regularly at the practice quarter-after-quarter, the cumulative effect is a continuing strengthening of relationships with customers and prospective customers alike. Veterinarians are more and more seeing a unique company that is truly committed to bringing an impressive set of first and only diagnostic and software solutions that advance their practice. Internationally, we are also seeing the benefits of enhanced commercial capability that we have built over the past few years. In all markets outside the U.S., the level of pet care, and the adoption of diagnostic technologies is far earlier in the curve than the U.S., even though people love their pets just as much. Our Companion Animal Group recurring diagnostic revenues grew 13% organically over Q1 of 2015 outside the U.S., supported by our ever-increasing level of Catalyst One placements. In addition, strong recurring gains in major developed economies in markets such as Europe, we are also seeing exceptional growth in the companion animal revenues in emerging markets such as China and Brazil, demonstrating the substantial long-term growth potential we see in our markets globally. A reason for our optimism on our long-term growth potential flows from the strength of our innovative pipeline, which is expanding the market for diagnostics globally. So, let's do a couple of updates here on these newest technologies. In Q1, we generated over 250 orders for SediVue, our first and only urine sediment analyzer. We have begun shipping SediVue to fulfill this backlog in April and the early customer response has been simply off the charts. So that means that while the field was busy generating customer orders, our Q1 results do not yet recognize the benefit of revenues from SediVue. If you consider U.S. order generation rate for all premium instruments in Q1, adding catalysts or two hematology platforms and SediVue together, our sales team achieved 36% growth over Q1 of 2015. We see a high level of excitement about SediVue in our commercial organization and customers alike, as the new instrument addresses a critical pain point in the practice, while increasing the quality and consistency of urinalysis results. We continue to educate the market on the remarkable value that SDMA brings in diagnosing and managing chronic kidney disease, a common condition in pets likened to heart disease in humans. The veterinary nephrology committee is fully bought into the unique medical and clinical value of SDMA. And the International Renal Interest Society has incorporated SDMA as a key parameter in their diagnosis, staging and treatment protocols. As investors know, SDMA is automatically included in every chemistry panel that is sent to IDEXX Reference Labs. Interestingly, our chemistry panel unit volumes and revenues in the U.S. are now growing faster than the Reference Lab overall, an acceleration that coincides with the SDMA launch last summer. This is likely because the number of veterinary practices sending us chemistry panels in the latest month is up 15% over March of 2015, when we had yet to launch SDMA. SDMA is now essentially fully launched on our global Reference Lab network. And to date, we have run 3.5 million SDMA tests for vets and pet owners globally. Finally, kudos to our Water team. We haven't taken the opportunity lately to talk about our Water business. This is a terrific business for IDEXX, and part of our core portfolio of businesses with attractive recurring revenues. Our Water team delivered 11% organic growth in the first quarter, a continuation of its strong 7% to 8% organic revenue growth over the prior two years. This global business delivered a 41% operating margin in Q1, requiring only nominal invested capital. Our Water Testing business addresses a market that appears to be able to sustain high-single-digit organic revenue growth and sustained operating margins for years to come. Overall, we believe that we are well positioned for sustained organic revenue growth and margin expansion in the company all together over the next several years, building on our accomplishments over the last several years and serving our core markets of animal health and water diagnostics, markets that are exhibiting underlying long-term, secular growth globally. With these introductory comments, I'll now open the call to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We'll go to the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions and good morning. Jon, maybe I'll start with one for you. Just in regards to the data you provided on the significant increase in the visit rate on a year-over-year basis, can you give us a little bit more color on what the vet participants that you're talking to are most interested in? Is it some of the new technologies? Is it kind of going back and learning about the entire IDEXX portfolio? Is it \u2013 just anything in particular that you're noticing in the numbers that might be sparked by those increased visits. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, first of all, I think they're most interested in the fact that we keep showing up, and we're there. The consistency of our presence is being noted by veterinarians. We're not like showing up and then not showing up for a long period of time. We keep coming back. And this is true with our customers that are using all of our diagnostic modalities. We're supporting them with \u2013 helping them to grow their practice, but it's also true with customers that may be using very little of IDEXX, but we keep showing up with ideas. They are very interested in our point-of-care solutions, real-time care, our reference lab modalities, our advances. I mean, SDMA is a big topic. Obviously, SediVue is a big topic. But generally what we're finding is, well, initially, as we get through to a decision maker, it may be something new that captures their initial attention. But then, it really opens up the door for how IDEXX is really profoundly different in terms of integrated solutions, in terms of VetConnect PLUS, in terms of the real fundamental technological innovation we're bringing to the Reference Lab venue. So we may start with SDMA, but then we move on to fecal antigen or molecular diagnostics or several of our other areas of specialized tests that, quite frankly, they just hadn't fully appreciated that we have. And they're seeing that we really are bringing innovation to the market, which really differentiates us and kind of unique. So I think the consistency of the presence is capturing the attention, and then the new innovations are drawing those relationships closer. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. That's very helpful color. And then maybe a follow-up. As you move more of your IT platforms into the cloud, and I know you already have links directly to the equipment and what's being used, can you talk a little bit about your future thoughts on things like vendor managed inventory where customers really don't even have to think about consumable re-orders so that even more of the time spent in the office can be discussing innovations or things like cost accounting to show the true value in something like SediVue? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Ryan, I do believe that's a big deal. Obviously, you've been ahead of the Internet of Everything innovation that's going on in industries around the world with cloud-based technology. And the vast majority, for example, of U.S. Catalyst and premium hematology are connected to IDEXX with SmartService. And so we're now beginning to see, with the example of the introduction of SediVue, one of the exciting responses we're getting from the customers is that they don't have to buy inventory. They only pay or run when they actually do the run. And here's just an interesting thing, as I said, we started to \u2013 we probably now have installed a couple of dozen SediVue analyzers as part of the backlog, that doesn't include the couple of dozen analyzers that we had as part of the beta field trial. But these are new customers who are paying customers for six months with (27:19) SediVue as part of the launch. As we do the initial installation, our field reps \u2013 our service reps do a lot of training. And historically, customers are very nervous about using the consumables. But with SediVue, we only charge during the run and we don't charge them for any of the runs on the first day. And so we get every single person in the practice to run the analyzer because they aren't worried about using up their inventory or paying for consumables. This idea that they don't have to manage their inventory and we're just going to ship them supplies like the Reference Lab model, we're going to ship them supplies on a demand generation basis based on their usage is very, very well appreciated by the customer and really I think the beginning of a new wave of innovation that we can bring to the market. And we'll learn a lot with SediVue over the course of this year on things that we can do in future years, on things like auto ship and vendor managed inventory. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Perfect. Thanks for the color. Congrats on the strong start to the year. Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is sort of a follow-up to the first part of Ryan's question. I guess, can you speak to the one-lab approach and the competitive advantages of that offer and then what you can offer now from a bundling standpoint or promotional standpoint? Has that promotional activity changed in response to this one-lab effort and the direct approach? Are you really starting to take advantage of what you can do there with the direct strategy as it matures? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Thank you. Obviously, first of all, the one-lab approach starts with one diagnostic consultant that's showing up regularly at the practice and can support a customer by growing their practice through adopting \u2013 what's interesting is that we have advanced menu on both our in-house analyzers and in the reference labs that isn't fully utilized by our customers. So we go in there and we have a discussion about how they can advance their diagnostics regardless of modality. So let's just start with the relationship is one which is agnostic to whether they want to run it in house or reference lab, and that really \u2013 customers appreciate that and they take their guard down because they know we're not coming with a point of view. And of course, what I didn't mention in my opening comments is we've continued to see the growth in VetConnect PLUS utilization, not only for results, by the way, and not only for results, but results with images. And now, of course, with SediVue, we're going to have in-house urinalysis images as part of the VetConnect PLUS, but now for ordering and status and alerts, the whole online ecosystem which is integrated between in-house and reference labs. So the so-called bundling isn't just a marketing program. It's an overall approach to the way they're utilizing diagnostics in their practice that just makes it easier to run, utilize and interpret and see the results of their diagnostics because it's fully integrated between reference labs and in-house. Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Great. And then the strong growth in the domestic lab business, that was a pretty significant step up. What's driving that? Is it market share gains, pricing, volume, the new testing capabilities such as SDMA or is it just seemingly a fundamental kind of demand trend that's driving that? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we're very pleased with the high-teens growth in the U.S. Reference Lab business, volume-led growth. And I think the simple answer is it's all of the above. I noted the increasing number of customers who are sending us chemistry panels because they want the SDMA result. It's either because it's part of their core protocol or maybe they have a pet where they want to send us the panel. But this is true also with our fecal antigen is growing same-store sales. Obviously, I think you're seeing from the phenomenal metrics that Brian quoted, the 6% visit growth year-over-year and the 9%, it was a very strong quarter in terms of the overall business dynamics. Those numbers, by the way, are normalized for days including leap year. And so, obviously, it was a very strong market in general and I think that was supporting our Reference Labs. So there are a lot of contributing factors. We're certainly pleased with the results, and we're pleased with the fundamentals in the Reference Lab business that \u2013 well, the first quarter I think was an exceptional quarter because of some unique aspects of the quarter. I think we're pleased with the fundamentals of growth in the reference lab modality. And I will mention it's the largest of the three recurring revenue, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue modalities at IDEXX. So it's nice to see that one doing so well. Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Quickly, did you break out that percentage of SDMA that's sent out on a one-off basis? And is there any change to the pricing there? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No, there is a \u2013 with regard to SDMA and one-off basis, what we're really seeing is that when a customer who may not be using us as a primary lab or maybe they're splitting their lab volume among more than one lab, they're not sending us the SDMA only sample, they're sending us the whole chemistry panel because it just makes sense to do so. Why would they split \u2013 go to the trouble actually of splitting the sample? It's just easier just to send us the whole sample. And economically, it's more attractive to do so because the cost of sample, the total chemistry panel includes SDMA at no incremental charge. Where we're really seeing the one-off SDMA are customers who are our loyal customers for both in-house and reference labs, and they might have been running the SDMA on the \u2013 I mean, they might have been running the chemistry panel on the in-house Catalyst and they want to augment that with an SDMA at the Reference Lab. And for that, we charge a nominal shipping charge, but we don't \u2013 we want to encourage people to continue to run real-time care if that's the modality they're most comfortable with. Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Excellent. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll go to the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open. Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks and good morning, guys. Maybe two from me. First one, Jon, back to what you mentioned on the sales and marketing, is that in business per year \u2013 is that the right number? Does it need to go higher as the company's innovation increases, meaning the need for more reps? Or now that you're almost 18 months into the go-direct experience, just your conviction level that you have the right number of reps and OpEx leverage may start to ramp a bit going forward? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Thank you for that question. I would have approached that from a couple of dimensions. Fundamentally, from a financial model, we do see operating expense leverage in the North American commercial market. Now, with kind of growths that we're seeing, we can have operating expense leverage and we can add a few more feet on the street along the way. So those two are not inconsistent with each other because of the strong growth rates that we're seeing, and certainly that would be our intent. But it's really kind of backing and filling little places that we haven't quite gotten to the optimal level. We believe that the roughly 180-plus veterinary diagnostic consultants within a couple percent is the right set to fully cover the market. But the other thing that I want to mention is, I mentioned the 23% year-over-year growth in visits on a same-rep basis for the veterinary diagnostic consultants. While we've seen tremendous productivity advances already that we've booked and those will have a cumulative effect, as I said, quarter after quarter. We're not anywhere near gaining the full productivity of this new organization. We've got some work to do over the next couple of years. We're going to be putting in Salesforce.com as a more advanced \u2013 we've done a lot in terms of sales force automation, but that's going to be a productivity driver. We're continuing to refine our calling patterns, so we're going to see greater presence in the market per rep. And so these productivity drivers, I think, as you've seen, they're going to be probably the number one contributor to the impact of our field organization, and that's going to translate into operating expense leverage. Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Very helpful. And one more, Jon and Brian, actually, some interesting comments on the promotion dollars. I believe I heard you correctly, decreasing sort of helping to aid results. So again, Jon, your thoughts on sustainable going forward is the belief that as long as the company's innovation is there you can sort of keep those promotion dollars under wraps because of the differentiation. And then, Brian, just one sort of from an accounting perspective, are there fewer promotions? Is that less dollars netted against revenues? I think that's correct or is it an OpEx expense? Thanks, guys. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : We obviously have a number of different ways that we go to market with our customers, but we've gotten a lot of questions on the net customer acquisition costs. And you can see that in our balance sheet actually and in our disclosures in terms of the short and long-term customer acquisition costs net. And the key thing to look at there is, as we add business, we add customer acquisition costs. So growth is a good thing. We did see accelerated growth last year, and that has moderated significantly in Q4 and Q1. So that's kind of key point one, which is this normalization of the competitive environment that we've seen and we just wanted to highlight that. Those costs do get amortized over time in terms of the long-term business commitments that we have. So the degree that we have, basically less money going against kind of defending customer retention, that will improve our net price realization over time. So our current results, really, where we had actually modest net price increases even with some of these carryover impacts, as we move forward, assuming kind of a continued normalization in the competitive environment, that could be a tailwind for us on the pricing front. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. And I would just add, I think, it's because we do see increasing loyalty with our customers across the modalities. And so what we're seeing here is two nice trends that are not inconsistent with each other. Moderation in the growth of the customer acquisition costs, but no moderation in the growth of customer acquisitions. Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Jon, can you provide us an update on when you initially started putting the SediVue in the hands of the initial users? And I think your guidance assumes 1,000 units. Can you just give us some context as to how you think that will track as we look out for the balance of the year? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : So we had really \u2013 I talked about two things. We had a couple of dozen units in the field that were non-revenue units in the first quarter that is part of our beta trial. It's part of our normal, refined instrument development and bringing it to market. We've gotten really good at bringing instruments to market, and one of those is to make sure we put the analyzer in the customer's hands in a beta to fully integrate all the learnings when the customers start using it because they do things we would never imagine they would do when we're looking at it in our test labs. What customers do with instruments in a veterinary environment, or maybe it's not just customers, but their pets, do to instruments surprises us. By the time we started shipping revenue units in April, we already had very good experience of how the unit would perform in the field from those beta trials. And so then, simultaneous to that, of course, we generated a revenue order backlog, as I said in Q1, and we started shipping revenue units against that, and we have a couple dozen in as part of a controlled launch process. We're always checking with customer feedback along the way to make sure we captured those learnings before we ramp the volume. The initial customer feedback has been extraordinarily positive. We're very pleased with where we were on the instrument launch. We are very excited \u2013 SediVue is going to be a major new modality. The value of a SediVue placement is closer to a value of a competitive catalyst than it is to a competitive hematology. And so, we're very \u2013 we feel very good about our outlook for the year, and that is incorporated in all the puts and takes in our revised organic growth guidance. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. Great. And so you raised 2016 revenue guidance by $40 million; $27 million is FX related. So as we're looking at our model, how would you suggest we allocate the incremental $13 million beat? Is it broad-based or is there a particular bucket we should be focusing on? Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Q1 was clearly a key part of that, right? We had signaled in the 8% to 9% growth rate and we achieved 11% So, that's flowing through the Q1 benefit. And the balance is really kind of through the year. I think we gave you some specific numbers, Mark, for Q2. And I think we're feeling good about the SediVue trends. So, over time, we think that can flow through, but I think a meaningful part of that is the Q1 beat. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Look, there are a lot of \u2013 I just want to remind you there are a lot of moving parts at IDEXX. Obviously, we had a lot of focus on parts of our business and not as much focus on other parts. We're an international company. We're in a lot of markets. Let's just take \u2013 the Water business had a phenomenal, knocking out of the park in the first quarter of 11%. That is not likely a sustainable number. We believe that's a high-single-digit growth business, and so all that's corporated [sic] in the annual guidance. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thanks. And maybe just one last one. You commented that the rapid test declined 1% organically in the quarter. How should we handicap the possibility that you return to a low to mid-single-digit growth outlook in 2016, and what are some of the challenges you're seeing in the field as you go out and compete against other providers? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I would say I think that's \u2013 by the way, our rapid assay performance is as we expected, and I think we indicated that we felt it would be flat in the first quarter. And that's because the compares are toughest in the first quarter versus the balance of the year. We don't give guidance by modality by region, but we don't really see any change in the fundamental trends that we've seen over the back half of the last year terms of the strength of the 4Dx franchise and the trends in our first generation SNAP products. All those trends are continuing as we expected. Mark Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll go to the line of David Westenberg with C.L. King. Your line is open. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and great quarter. You're seeing good traction abroad. Can you talk about the expected utilization internationally compared to the U.S.? Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Thank you for the question. I think you're probably referring to the instrument and consumable utilization there. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Exactly, the catalyst utilization. I mean the catalyst placement numbers abroad have been really good for the last few quarters. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : And we're really seeing really nice consumable growth that's coming out of that augmented rate of placements. And so, the accounts outside the U.S. are smaller than the U.S. generally speaking. So the utilization per account is lower and we were \u2013 there's still a very significant installed base of tests that we're upgrading, although we continue to \u2013 none of those numbers included VetTest placements. We continue to place VetTest in some markets too, expanding our overall chemistry base, which is now over 40,000 active customers globally. But the rate of placements is really quite good in what are, generally speaking, have and always been smaller accounts. I think Catalyst One is just a phenomenal instrument because of all the things that brings complete menu, unique menu with things like T4 integrated, ease of use using whole blood with no issues, the footprint, the integration, the VetConnect PLUS, these are all unique aspects of Catalyst One that make it very attractive for these smaller practices outside the U.S. Let alone practices in the U.S. where, if they need the capacity, it's very economical to add another Catalyst One to the same IDEXX VetLab station. So, it's a very flexible analyzer that works in big practices and the types of practices that we see internationally. Combined with a phenomenal and experienced commercial organization, we have very experienced set of country mangers. Many of our \u2013 some of our country mangers have been in that roles over a decade. They've grown with IDEXX. They know their markets inside-out. We are fully direct in most developed countries now. It's been a systematic process that we've been putting in place over the last several years and I think we're seeing the benefits of that. And then when you talk about utilization, the thing is that \u2013 things like preventative care are just things that are actually doing a full panel on a sick pet, it's surprising how little that has done today. And so, part of what we're doing is we're growing the market. We're expanding the market through education and providing them the tools with things like Catalyst One and reference lab to be able to do that. So, a lot of this is market development. I really don't see any end in sight in the opportunity to develop the market in these \u2013 in what some people refer to as mature, developed continents (46:54). Well, they're not matured and developed to us, let alone the kind of growth we're seeing in markets like Brazil and China. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And then, you and your competitor are just seeing massive growth rate in reference lab. I believe you quoted high-teens in the U.S. Your competitor quoted 9. Can you talk about what's driving that in North America specifically? Are you seeing some cannibalization of inside lab or is this just an overall, just incredibly healthy market that's doing a lot more diagnostic testing? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : First of all, it's a very attractive market, and I think you can see that from our visit data and same-store sales practice data that Brian quoted of 9.2% in the first quarter and that was a very, very strong underlying market that we're seeing. We don't really speak to what we're seeing. But the other thing we're seeing is volume growth in existing customers, that's not just things like existing panels, but adoption of our advanced menu, things like fecal or molecular diagnostics or some of our other specialty test categories. So, what we're seeing is a growing utilization of things that only the reference lab can provide, but we're still seeing strong growth in the in-house modality, so, in chemistry in-house. And so, I think testing begets testing. I don't think there's any kind of fundamental shift happening between one and the other. They just have their own growth dynamics. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. And congratulations on a good quarter. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Thank you. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James. Your line is open. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Nice quarter. Just wanted to get a better sense of constant currency gross margins. Obviously, hedging gains and FX is playing a role there but gross margins were a little bit below our estimate. I'm just trying to get a better sense of how underlying trends are performing. I know you had a strong instrument quarter, so that might play a role. But just wanted to get more thoughts on constant currency gross margins. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Yeah. I mentioned that the constant currency change year-on-year was 70 basis points down. So, taking out the currency hedge gain impacts, and it was really two dynamics. It was the \u2013 part of this was the \u2013 compared to \u2013 we had some favorable capitalized variances last year in terms of particularly in our LPD business that just had a high volume rate that flowed into lower product costs but you can see that in our reporting last year that we highlighted and that was a key part of it. The other piece of this is the instrument revenues and the instrument mix. Let's say that our comparable margins in our business are quite good. We're improving gross margins and labs. Our margins in our core instrument businesses and things like that are doing quite well. So, net-net, we think we're right on track relative to where our gross margin goals. We knew we had some of the compare issues on to FX heading into the year, but we're reinforcing the operating margin outlook, which was \u2013 effectively where (50:15) sustained gross margins this year constant currency and some OpEx leverage, and we're right on track for that. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I also, Nick, want to reinforce that we see the opportunity over time over the next several years for gross margin expansion driven by our reference lab business around the world as well as the instrument and consumable business and also, again, it's smaller group, it's a smaller business, our information management business as we shift to the cloud. So, these are all long-term trends, we think, that will support our overall margin expansion strategy. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's helpful. And then, you think about the organic growth guidance for the full year, obviously off to a very strong start. Is there anything that you're seeing in the marketplace that would suggest to you that the end market could potentially decelerate because it's clear to me that you have momentum across a variety of modalities. You have a burgeoning sales force that's successfully undertaking this transition. So I'm just trying to get a sense of why you would think that potentially growth would decelerate off of the strong 1Q levels? Thanks. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Well, there are a couple of factors in Q1 that we did highlight. I think the extra day was about a point, and it's tough to parse weather, but clearly, we had some favorable U.S. weather compares. And so, let's say that was about 1 point. It's again hard to estimate. But that's kind of in line with what we said we were going to do this year, net of those effects, and we feel very good about the trends in the business and we've obviously raised our guidance reflecting that. And so, we're not projecting a \u2013 it's not reflective of an expected deceleration in the business. It's more reflecting some \u2013 a couple of the unique factors to Q1. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think Brian did appropriate call out of some special factors in Q1 which is embedded in our guidance. Certainly, we don't see a deceleration. Our crystal ball isn't any better than anybody else's with regard to the general economy. But what I will say is that what happens is, overtime, as consumer confidence remains okay, maybe not fabulous, but okay, then they add pets to their household and then they need to take care of them. I think the fundamental underlying environment that we've been in, that's built up over the last couple of years of consumers feeling okay or reasonably confident or having moved further away from the financial crisis, it really means that it's \u2013 that the trends in pet healthcare growth are pretty solid. And it takes a lot to change those trends because people love their pets and they're going to make sure that their pets are taken care of even if they get pressed in other areas of their wallet. Now, they may not always replace their pet if they face a great recession like they did in 2019 (sic) [2009] (53:32) and that moderated the growth for a couple of years, 2010-2011, but now we've kind of come back out of that. And I think we've seen it was just generally a very, very good market. And, of course, the level of care that can be provided now by veterinarians is ever expanding. And so, we are blessed by serving an importing growing secular growth market. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's it for me. Nicely done, guys. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Thank you. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I just want to thank everybody for signing on the call. We are just wanted my huge congratulations to the work that's been done by IDEXX around the globe across all the functions. We've done a lot of work to reposition the company over the last couple of years, and I think we're now in a place where we can perfect our new model. We're not making any big model changes like we've had in the past. And it's very, very gratifying that we could see the results of the hard work, including innovation and customer contact and the supporting organizations. So, I just want to really thank our organization for that and we recognize that we're here to create shareholder value and that's part of our job, part of our model, part of our purpose. And we are very focused on continuing to grow the company in a way which will generate and continue to generate attractive returns on invested capital. So, that will conclude the call.

I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. IDEXX delivered exceptional performance in Q2 building on our strong start to the year. In terms of highlights, we achieved organic revenue growth of 13% in Q2, well ahead of expectations supported by 12% organic growth in the U.S. and 14% organic revenue gains in international markets. Recurring CAG Diagnostics revenues increased 12% organically, up from strong Q1 levels, driven by double-digit gains in the U.S. and international regions. We had another outstanding quarter in terms of instrument placements as well with a 31% increase in premium instrument placements year-on-year, supported by the very successful launch of SediVue and 18% growth in Catalyst placements. Overall, SediVue added about 2% to revenue growth in the quarter. Closer benefits from strong top line performance and controlled operating expense growth supported better than expected operating margin performance and very strong profit results. Q2 EPS was $0.74, up 23% as reported and 33% on a constant currency basis. As expected, foreign exchange provided headwind to reported results, lowering reported revenue growth by about 1% and EPS by about $0.06 per share with profit impacts driven primarily by the lapping of 2015 hedge gains. Based on our strong year-to-date performance and positive momentum, we're increasing our 2016 full year revenue guidance by $25 million, which implies an organic growth outlook of about 10% to 11.5%. We're also increasing our 2016 EPS guidance by $0.14 per share to $2.32 to $2.39, or 19% to 23% growth on an adjusted constant currency basis. This outlook incorporates improved expectations for operating margin gains year-over-year of about 100 basis points for the full year on a constant currency basis, adjusted for last year's software impairment charge. We'll review our updated 2016 outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our Q2 performance by segment and region. Future performance was driven by accelerated Companion Animal Group gains and continued strong growth in our Water business. Global CAG revenues were $400 million, up 13% organically, supported by strong CAG recurring diagnostic revenue gains across regions and modalities, as well as strong global growth in instrument sales. Water revenues increased 12% organically to $28 million as we continue to see benefits from our commercial investments and solid global market growth trends. Water growth benefited by about 4% in the quarter from one-time project revenues and incremental testing associated with the 2015 Crypto outbreak in the UK. These factors will not aid growth to the same degree in the second half of 2016, when we expect high single-digit organic growth in Water revenues. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues grew 4% organically in Q2 to $33 million as gains in China and Brazil offset lower European bovine testing levels. By region, U.S. revenues were $286 million in the quarter, up 12%, supported by strong growth in premium instrument placements, including benefits from the launch of SediVue, which added about 3% to overall U.S. growth. U.S. CAG recurring diagnostic revenues grew 10% organically, supported by continued double-digit revenue growth in our U.S. Lab business, accelerating consumable volume gains and solid organic revenue gains in rapid assay, in part supported by the timing of promotional programs. Recurring CAG revenue gains continued to be primarily volume-driven with improving benefits from net price realization, reflecting the benefits of innovation, such as SDMA and our strong field presence with customers. We also continue to experience moderation of growth in net customer acquisition costs, reflecting our success in differentiating IDEXX's diagnostic technologies from competitive offerings. U.S. market growth, reflected in our data set of about 5,200 clinics, continues to trend solidly. In Q2, patient visits increased 1.7%, and clinic revenues increased 4.9% overall. There was likely a modest shift of some testing to Q1 this year, given favorable winter weather conditions in certain markets. For the first half overall, patient visits were up 3.9% and practice revenues increased 7.0%, reflecting continued strong market momentum. International revenues in the second quarter were $181 million, reflecting 14% organic growth. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth accelerated to 17% in international markets in Q2, supported by very strong instrument consumable growth. Our international results reflect momentum from exceptional success in expanding our Catalyst platform globally and accelerated Lab revenue growth in key markets such as Germany and the UK, aided by new business gains and improved customer visit trends in the quarter. Global instrument revenues for IDEXX were $33 million, up 35% organically, supported by outstanding growth in premium instrument placements, including benefits from our very successful launch of SediVue. Globally, we've placed 1,334 Catalysts, 934 premium hematology analyzers and 467 SediVues. Strong North America results were supported by accelerated competitive placement levels. We placed 502 Catalysts in North America in Q2 with 300, or 60%, at competitive or greenfield accounts. This reflects productivity growth by our North American direct sales team and additional benefits from expanded discussions with customers connected to our launch of SediVue. These gains and continued improvement in placement retention supported a 14% expansion of our U.S. Catalyst instrument base over prior-year levels. International performance continues to be very strong as well, reflected in 1,373 premium instrument placements, up 16% over prior-year levels, supported by continued exceptional customer response to Catalyst One. Strong placement gains are driving higher growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Global CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues were $338 million in Q2, up 12% organically. By modality, instrument consumable revenues of $115 million grew 14% organically, supported by accelerating growth in the U.S and very strong international gains. Reference laboratory consulting services revenues were $153 million in Q2. 14% organic gains were supported by solid double-digit growth across U.S. and international markets. U.S. lab revenue gains continued at a strong pace, with 13% organic growth supported by benefits from SDMA, which continues to drive accelerated growth in core chemistry panels. Rapid assay revenues increased 7% organically in Q2 to $56 million, driven by volume gains in 4Dx. Q2 growth also benefited from favorable comparisons related to the timing of 2015 first half promotions. Underlying trends in rapid assay remain solid as we work through comparisons to prior-year impacts related to the introduction of competitive first-generation assay products. Veterinary software services, our new name for our customer information management business, and digital imaging systems revenues were $29 million in the quarter, up 8% organically. Growth was driven by increased digital revenue, reflecting digital radiography placement gains and benefits from recognition of deferred revenues associated with long-term business commitments. Software services revenue was also up solidly. Turning to the P&L, strong revenue growth and flow-through drove very strong profit results in the quarter. Operating profit was $104 million, up 18% compared to the prior year, supported by gains in our CAG and Water segments. As expected, the lapping of $5 million in 2015 foreign exchange hedge gains and unfavorable year-over-year changes in foreign exchange hedge rates had a moderating impact on our reported second quarter financial results. Excluding currency impacts, operating profits increased 26%. Operating margins of 22.3% were up 230 basis points on a constant currency basis, reflecting volume leverage and controlled operating expense growth, including benefits from the shifting of some investments to the second half of this year. Gross profit was $261 million in Q2, up 12% on a reported basis. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, including the lapping of $5 million in prior year hedge gains, gross profit margins increased 70 basis points. Constant currency gross margin gains reflect benefits from moderate price increases, productivity in our reference labs, including leverage of strong volume gains, as well as improvements in our software services business. Mix impacts from higher instruments revenues partially moderated these gains. For 2016, we had a very small foreign exchange hedge gain reported in gross profit in Q2. Operating expenses increased 8% in Q2, in line with Q1 growth levels. Shifting of certain OpEx investments to the second half will drive relatively higher OpEx growth in Q3. As noted, EPS was $0.74 per share, up 23% on a reported basis and 33% adjusted for currency impacts. The federal R&D tax credit, which benefited 2016 but not 2015's second quarter results, had a favorable 2% EPS growth impact. EPS growth continues to benefit from share repurchases advanced over the last year, supported by a strong free cash flow and optimization of our capital structure, which reduced average share count year on year by 3.7%. In Q2, we repurchased 269,000 shares for $23 million. Year to date, we've repurchased over 1 million shares at an average price of $74 per share. We ended Q2 with $1.2 billion in debt outstanding with an average interest rate of about 2.4%, reflecting a gross leverage ratio of 2.7 times adjusted EBITDA. Cash and investment balances were $370 million at quarter-end. Looking ahead, we're raising our full-year guidance today to reflect our strong growth momentum and operational performance. We're increasing our 2016 revenue guidance range to $1.755 billion to $1.775 billion, an increase of $25 million, yielding reported revenue growth of approximately 9.5% to 11%. As noted, this implies an increase in our 2016 organic growth guidance to approximately 10% to 11.5%, on track with the long-term double-digit growth potential we've outlined for our business. We're raising our 2016 EPS guidance by $0.14 to $2.32 to $2.39, reflecting flow-through benefits from higher organic revenue growth and our outlook for relatively higher operating margins this year. We're now targeting operating margins of about 19% for 2016, up about 100 basis points compared to 2015 on a constant currency basis, adjusted for the 2015 software impairment charge. We've updated our outlook for foreign exchange impacts, with assumptions detailed in our press release. For 2016, the recent weakening of the British pound was largely offset by improvements in other currencies such as the yen and the Brazilian real, as well as benefits from previously established hedge positions. At the updated exchange rates outlined in our press release, we estimate that foreign exchange rate changes will reduce year-on-year revenue growth in 2016 by about 1% and 2016 EPS by $0.20 per share, including net impacts from the lapping of $21 million in 2015 hedge gains, compared to projected hedge gains of about $4 million in 2016. We continue to estimate our effective tax rate at 30.5% to 31% for the year. We're now projecting free cash flow at about 100% of net income, the high end of our previous guidance range, reflecting strong progress in managing down inventory levels. We're also updating our share count outlook, with expectations for an approximate 3% net reduction in average shares outstanding this year. This lower projected benefit incorporates impacts from our higher stock price on our diluted share projection. For Q3, we're projecting reported revenue gains of 9.5% to 10.5%, and organic revenue gains of about 10% to 11%. As noted, we expect relatively moderated Water growth in the second half of this year and anticipate a moderated rapid assay gains, relative to strong Q2 growth levels. In terms of the P&L, we expect that operating margins will be about 100 basis points below 2015 Q3 levels, which were 19.7% adjusted for the one-time software impairment charge. The Q3 outlook reflects timing of 2016 operating expense investments and impacts from foreign exchange, including the lapping of $5 million in 2015 foreign exchange hedge gains in Q3. Please keep in mind that year-on-year benefits from share count reductions will moderate in the second half. For Q3, we expect year-on-year average diluted share count will decline about 2%. That concludes our financial review and I'll turn the discussion over to Jon for his comments. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Thank you, Brian. As Brian indicated, we delivered an exceptional quarter with accelerating organic revenue growth of 13% and strong contributions from all regions of the world. The quarter is a gratifying validation of the strategies we have put in place to serve our markets with profitable one-of-a-kind innovation supported by strong and deep customer relationships. Double-digit U.S. CAG growth benefited from continuing increases in the productivity of our direct sales organization and solidifying customer relationships that come from a consistent presence in the market. Year-to-date in the U.S. our diagnostic professionals have made over 124,000 in-person visits to veterinary practices, or an average of five visits for every U.S. veterinary practice. During these visits, we bring value-added innovation in education, which results in deepening IDEXX relationships with customers of all types. These visits drive achievement of our commercial objective of widespread adoption of our first and only innovations. For example, our U.S commercial team achieved greater than 50% growth in premium instrument orders over the second quarter of last year, including both exceptional growth in placements of our Catalyst chemistry system and outstanding results with SediVue analyzers, which began shipping in Q2 of this year. Our international CAG team also continues to drive strong premium instrument placements, demonstrating the global potential for Catalyst and supporting accelerating growth in the recurring revenue of the instrument consumables. Overall globally, our 14% organic revenue growth in instrument consumables was achieved through a combination of strong instrument placements, continuing high 97% to 99% customer retention levels, modest price realization and the adoption of a new test menu by our installed base of Catalyst customers, most notably the successful adoption of our recently introduced T4 slide. All of these are indicators that our strategy of bringing innovation to the in-house testing market is truly resonating with customers, leading to enduring growth and the profitable recurring revenue streams from in-house testing. Our global reference lab organic growth of 14% was driven in part by the growing appreciation by the veterinary profession of the remarkable value that SDMA brings to our chemistry offering. One way to measure the SDMA impact is to consider growth of orders that include a chemistry panel. By way of background, these drive a little over 50% of our overall reference lab revenue. If we compare the relative growth of these revenues versus revenues from non-chemistry orders in our U.S. reference lab before and after the launch of SDMA, we can estimate that SDMA contributed about 2% to 3% to our overall U.S. reference lab growth in Q2. We are earlier in the launch of SDMA in international markets, being only about six to eight months. But it is also nice to see our strong double-digit revenue growth in these markets. Turning to SediVue, we're extremely pleased with the North American launch of SediVue in the second quarter. Our second quarter placements included the order backlog generated from the first quarter and orders from the second quarter, not including the order backlog extending into the third quarter. This is a testament to the compelling value proposition and the quality of the SediVue instruments that we placed 467 in that very first quarter of our launch. This is a record installation ramp for us compared to historical IDEXX major instrument launches. The market for SediVue is deep and broad, as there is nothing like it. SediVue addresses a major pain point for in-house urinalysis. We expect the launch of SediVue in certain countries beyond the U.S. and Canada in Q4 2016 with the bulk of the international launches to take place in 2017. In the meantime, our international teams are having a field day with Catalyst One and SDMA. Finally, before the Q&A, I want to turn to a couple of brief updates on our pipeline of future technologies. First, we expect to introduce software for SNAP Pro in Q4 this year that will upgrade the device to automatically interpret results of all of our SNAP tests. By way of background, we have over 11,000 SNAP Pros in the U.S. market with 8,000 customers, all of which will be upgradable to the new software, and we continue to place SNAP Pro mobile devices with customers who appreciate their role and practice productivity and profitability as part of our integration strategy. SNAP Pro adds value to the SNAP experience and thus helps drive retention and growth of this element of our Companion Animal diagnostic recurring revenues. Second, we expect to introduce the SDMA test on the Catalyst slide for in-house use in Q4 of 2017. Given the success of SDMA, including this test as part of the Catalyst chemistry profile to be run right along with the rest of the tests in the panel in one run will be yet another game-changing impact of SDMA, and for our in-house chemistry offering. It will bring SDMA to a large set of customers who do not use or have access to our reference labs, expanding SDMA's clinical impact. In the U.S., we expect the list price of the slide will be about $10 per test, and the average unit price realized will be a few dollars less than that due to the profile rebate programs as we will be aiming to drive adoption and volume growth. Third, we expect to launch SNAP fecal in the first quarter of 2018 based on the development timeframes and the USDA approval process. SNAP fecal will bring more accurate technology for the antigen testing to an easy-to-use SNAP format for the screening of common intestinal parasites. In summary, I'm very proud of what our teams achieved around the world, and what they have accomplished in the second quarter of 2016 and year-to-date. We are blessed to serve growing markets with innovations that come in the form of growing, profitable and enduring recurring revenues. In the process, we are serving our purpose to enhance the health and wellbeing of pets and their owners. And yet our job is not done, as we are only in the early days of the adoption cycle of such blockbusters as Catalyst, SediVue and SDMA, not to mention many other products and services that are either aren't on-market or in our R&D pipeline. And as strong as our revenue and profit performance was in Q2, we see significant opportunities for continued productivity and how we achieve our potential for 10% constant currency revenue growth year-in, year-out, driving continued solid gains in operating margins in support of achieving our 15% to 20% constant currency EPS growth targets over our planning horizon. And so that, Cynthia, we'll open the call to Q&A. Thank you. Operator : Certainly. And our first question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels of William Blair. Your line is open. Nick M. Hiller - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi, this is Nick Hiller in for Ryan Daniels. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong quarter. Could you speak a little more about the market reception to SediVue, obviously a very solid demand for the product, but how long do you believe the tail for this demand will be, meaning is it resonating only with the larger clinics or is it really more across the board? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, thank you for that question, Nick. We're really extremely pleased by SediVue's performance. It was a contributor to the 50% year-over-year growth in premium instrument placements by the U.S. sales team in the second quarter. I think we're in only very early days, top of the first inning here, with SediVue. The number of orders we generated in the second quarter was pretty close to the number of deliveries, and as I said, there is a broad and deep market. Now, there are 25,000 veterinary practices, so it doesn't have to be a huge percentage to be a pretty big market opportunity for us in the U.S. and, of course, we believe there is opportunity around the world. Every practice does urinalysis. Every practice has the same problem and the analyzer is justified with really no more than one urinalysis a day, one to one-and-a-half. So it's a deep market and we have a great team to bring that technology \u2013 first and only; nothing like it in the market \u2013 to our customers. Nick M. Hiller - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on SediVue. What's been the response to the new consumable model there? Has it changed your philosophy on how you might sell consumables going forward to a pay-as-you-use model? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : First of all, the response is very positive to the pay-per-run that we introduced uniquely with SediVue. I think the customer conversation is mostly about the value that the analyzer brings to the practice. The pay-per-run is, if you will, icing on the cake. It's, \"Oh! And I don't have to invest and worry about inventory.\" It's just like the reference lab model of supplies in advance and pay after I use. So it's sort of the final piece that is attractive. We believe that there are elements of that that are unique to SediVue, but there is an element, which is what we call auto replenishment, which is automatically shipping based on usage, that we could apply in the future as we perfect that model and one of the unique benefits of our direct sales organization and direct sales model. But that would not be pay-per-run; that would still be a pay for the consumable in advance, but it would simplify the inventory management and actually eliminate the need to order the consumable. And that could be a nice customer benefit, but we're a ways away from that. We've got a lot of work to do in 2016. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great, thanks for taking my questions. You mentioned SDMA launch on the Catalyst, which is an interesting development, but you also mentioned SDMA is contributing to reference laboratory growth pretty considerably. Presumably this would increase testing overall, but do you view this will cannibalize any other reference laboratory gains? I guess, how should I kind of weigh those on balance? And will you still be adding SDMA chemistry to the chemistry panels, I guess, for free? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : No. Well, so the bottom line is we think that SDMA expands the opportunity and the value of chemistry testing overall, okay? So it's a market expansion opportunity. Many of our customers are saying, \"Oh, now I have a better reason, for example, to talk to my customers about preventive care testing, because there are things like chronic kidney disease that I can catch earlier when I have time to do something about it.\" So I think in general, SDMA is a market expansion. We always have an in-house offering and a reference lab offering. And many of our customers say, \"I would use SDMA, but I'm committed to real-time care. And getting the SDMA the next day after I've done the whole real-time care protocol with the customers isn't quite working for me.\" So I think what we'll do is it'll bring SDMA as a routine part of the chemistry panel to the in-house modality. We don't anticipate changing our strategy with regard to reference lab pricing of chemistry panels from what we have today. We believe that SDMA will have an enduring impact on incremental growth for the reference lab overall. Of course, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we will be charging for the slide \u2013 on the in-house because it has a cost associated with us, but we think by the time we'll launch the slide we'll be two years into education of the market of the profound and remarkable value that SDMA brings, really as what I think is recognized as the most important among a whole set of important chemistry parameters but more reliable than the most frequently used and understood parameter today, called creatinine. And so, when you have a parameter that's more reliable than probably the top of the list, that has an impact on the value of the chemistry panel. Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great, that's helpful. And there was a stepdown in operating expenses in the quarter. Can you elaborate on the delays in the timing for certain investments that you were referring to, and how should we think about that quarterly progression of operating margin trends? Thanks. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Yeah, we tried to give indications on that, Erin, so last year we were 19.7% in Q3, taking out the software impairment charge, and we think we'll be down about 100 basis points in Q3. The OpEx growth has been about 8% year on year, year to date. It will higher in the third quarter. It's largely a combination of select programmatic investments and just timing of some hires. And some of that just occurred later, and that added some favorability to the quarter. The second quarter was really more reflective of just exceptional top line growth and great flow-through, so I think we feel very good about the track that we're on. As I indicated, for the full year we're now projecting that we'll be about 19% for operating margins, which is up 100 basis points year on year on a constant currency basis. And, as Jon indicated, we feel very good about being on track to get operating margin leverage going forward in support of our 15% to 20% EPS growth goals, and we'll share more on that when we talk to everyone at Investor Day. Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Excellent. Thanks so much. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go to the line of Jonathan Block with Stifel. Your line is open. Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you and good morning. Jon, the first one just has to do with \u2013 the practice management figures that you provide are \u2013 they're robust; arguably, they reflect thousands of practices. And the industry sequential deceleration was maybe a bit greater than I would have thought from 1Q to 2Q. So can you just talk to what you're seeing with the industry so far in the third quarter? Clearly, a big part of everyone's bullishness has been on the favorable trends in the space, and are you picking anything up that gives us pause one month into 3Q? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Jon, for the question. That's why I think Brian talked about the 7% growth. And, recognize, this is the reported revenues. The actual revenues from over 5,000 veterinary practices with, by the way, practice management systems of all types, so it's a pretty robust data set. It is the same-store sales data set, so it doesn't account for net practice formation. I think that the first quarter was exceptional at 9%. I believe the fourth quarter was more like 7%. We've seen 5.5% to 7% kind of growth in the revenue on the same-store basis in this metric over the last several years. April was a little weak, probably for whatever reason, picked back up in May and June, and so one month or even a quarter does not a trend make. But we see it's a pretty solid market. People love their pets. We've done some research that suggests that millennials love their pets even more than their parents, which is pretty amazing given what Baby Boomers have done in terms of taking care of their pets. So I think that the broad trends are favorable. The macro \u2013 it's relatively less sensitive to the macro but not insensitive to the macro, and of course your guess is as good as ours on where that's going. Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : And Jon, I just add to Jon's comments, obviously, we disclose on the U.S. market, but the international markets, we saw very good underlying market growth trends in the quarter. That was one of the factors that was supporting the very strong European performance that we noted in strong lab growth. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : I think, to take a point in case, we like to bring up Brazil, which is getting a lot of attention with the Olympics and all and is in I think one of their largest economic crises in the post World War II era, and we've got exceptional growth in Brazil. People love their pets, and so it's a favorable underlying cycle megatrend of value in their pets. Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Very helpful. And then, Brian, I think you're now targeting, as you just mentioned, 100 bps of Op margin expansion in 2016, up from I believe what was 50 bps; and at the 2015 Analyst Day, I think you talked about 50 bps near-term, 50 bps to 100 bps long-term; you're already at 100 bps and so, I guess, where I'm going with this is, have these plans been accelerated and now we should start thinking about Op margin expansion goals of 100 basis points per annum going forward? Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : You know, we'll talk more about that at Investor Day. I think 50 bps to 100 bps is a good range for us on an annual basis to be targeting kind of a combination of gross margin benefits as we grow and with sustaining a healthy level of investment while getting a level of leverage off of our cost structure or our operating expense structure. So I think the 50 to 100 basis points still makes sense. We've got a tremendous growth opportunity as a business and we're very focused on our core business. This is what we invest towards, right. We're not diversifying. We're ... Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : We've got a good market and we focus on execution here, as Brian said. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : There aren't a lot of industries, I think, where you have this strong high single-digit organic growth and an opportunity as a company to grow even faster. So we want to balance the margin increments that we deliver, which we're committed to, with appropriately balancing that with investments for the long-term growth. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And Jon, again, thank you for the question. As you recall from our Investor Day last August, the 50 to 100 basis points for long-term margin expansion is very consistent with what we stated as part of our core financial model back then. Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Last one from me, just a quick one. I may have missed it. The SDMA in clinic, Jon, that you mentioned in 4Q 2017, will that be compatible on the current catalyst sort of like a T4 backwards integrated, if you would, or will it require a new analyzer? Thanks, guys. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you for the question. It's a great question, and you are exactly right. It's completely compatible with the over 20,000 installed base of Catalyst Dx and Catalyst One analyzers, and it will work just like T4. Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mary Kate with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Mary Kate Gorman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Oh, sorry. Well, thank you. Mary Kate Gorman on for Mark Massaro. Congrats on the great quarter. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Mary Kate Gorman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: So my first question has to do with rapid and the 7% organic growth you posted in this quarter. Is there a certain seasonality baked into that number given, say, higher flea or tick revenue in the summer seasons? And to that extent, can you comment a bit on the promotional programs? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thank you again for the question. We've seen very solid performance in our overall rapid assay business, really for the last four quarters. There can be compares from \u2013 and it's a seasonal business, but, of course, if you're comparing to second quarter last year, you're comparing to the same season. So there can be variations based on the timing of our promotional programs from quarter to quarter, but overall, we're very pleased with the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs to communicate the clear clinical exceptional differentiation in our rapid assay technology and the accuracy that customers expect versus newer competitive offerings using lateral flow technology, and I think customers recognize that; they recognize the value of multi-analyte testing in one test as we have with 4Dx Plus, which has been very solid. So we're going to be, of course, adding more value to the rapid assay business with the upgrade of SNAP Pro and SNAP interpretation, which has been a requested feature of our customers. Again, it's like the SDMA for the Catalyst. Our analyzers grow in value over time, and they grow through software upgrades. And those software upgrades can be delivered through the Internet of Everything, because almost all of our analyzers and the majority of our SNAP Pros are connected to the Internet, so we just in the background download these software upgrades. This is totally unique to the IDEXX platform, the information management platform. And so, all of our offerings grow in value over time, and so we're very pleased with where we are with the rapid assay business. I'd say 7% was a kind of above average response, and if you average the first and second quarter, you probably get closer to what we think is \u2013 that where we are with that business. Mary Kate Gorman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you. That's very helpful. And if I could ask a second question, I'm not sure if you provided backlog numbers for SediVue as they currently stand, but you mentioned that SediVue contributed 2% in overall revenue in the quarter? And I was wondering if you could comment a little bit more, how we should think about those contributions in Q3 and Q4 given targeting still 1,000 SediVue placements for 2016? Thank you. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Yeah. We originally had estimates \u2013 goals this year for 1,000 placements. And I think Jon mentioned that we have a nice order pool in the second quarter that's sort of in line with your placement levels. And I think it's \u2013 our outlook incorporates that we think we can do 1,500 or more this year, so we built in some upside from that, and the timing is we'll see how it plays out over Q3 and Q4, but we think we are ahead of track of where we thought we might be and feel very good about the customer reception and this is a long-term build for us. We think there is a significant opportunity with SediVue in the North American market and globally and we'll be looking forward to sharing more of that. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. And SediVue, of course, is a razor/razor-blade business model, so when we talk about the placement of analyzers, well, of course, we get the revenue associated with the instrument sale. But we also start to build the recurring revenue of the pay-per-run and that happens year after year. So as we grow the install base over year after year, this will be a contributor to the instrument consumable growth for IDEXX, and it adds value to the rest of the suite so it improves the retention and helps us acquire customers for the entire in-house suite, which also supports the recurring revenue component of the business model. Mary Kate Gorman - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you so much, and congrats again on the quarter. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We will go the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James. Your line is open. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys, congrats, gee, perfect quarter across the board. A couple of questions. Just first, I know some competitors are talking about bringing their own connectivity solution to the market later this year. And I just wanted to kind of bring that into context of how strong your instrument growth has been as of late. How do you feel \u2013 as competition starts to maybe get a little bit more apples-to-apples relative to your platform \u2013 how do you think about kind of instrument growth sustaining the 35% plus organic trend that you saw in the second quarter? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thank you, Nick, for those comments. Of course, it's all about the recurring revenue growth, because that's the enduring profitable sustainable part of what instruments bring. We've been working on our information technologies strategy for in-house instruments for a decade. Today, we have an installed base of 27,000 IDEXX VetLab Stations globally, about 90% of them are connected via SmartService. We have 9,000 customers in the U.S. that are connected two-way; they're in-house and in practice management of all types. We have 23,000 VetConnect Plus activations. Interesting, utilization has grown year-over-year in the second quarter of VetConnect Plus by over 70%. And we're adding additional functionality. Of course, SediVue brings images. We have images from the reference lab. We've added reference lab ordering in the fourth quarter. All of this has helped and achieve an essential \u2013 an essential element of our integration strategy is the activities of our 80-plus field service reps. It doesn't happen unless they're in the field helping customers actually go through the installation and change management process of going to an integrated offering. So I'd say that this is a strategy that is well developed but still progressing at a very rapid rate and we are very comfortable with the high-level differentiation and the ability in the field to be able to talk about the unique value that this integration strategy brings to IDEXX. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's helpful. And then secondly, just in terms of the organic growth outperformance, it's probably opening up opportunities perhaps to reinvest some of that outperformance back into the business to sustain this double-digit engine that you guys have developed. How do you think about R&D allocation over the next 12 to 18 months? Do you feel like you could potentially actually increase the development capabilities if you're continuing to deliver the organic growth that you're guiding to this year? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. I think we have a sustained commitment to R&D. I think what's most notable is the level of productivity we've achieved in our R&D investments over the past few years to really generate some extraordinary products in the form of Catalyst One, which really nothing like it, you could see it by the world response to it. SDMA, which is the most important new parameter in the veterinary profession in 50 years. And SediVue, which is an entirely new in-house modality. We have a significant investment in the current numbers for continued menu expansion, for continued advancement of our instrument platforms, and a very important area is information technology. Certainly, the cloud and the Internet of Everything, these are major technologies that we are \u2013 even though we've got now close to a decade of experience in these technologies, depending on which one you pick, we still feel like we're in the early days of what this can do for our business model. And so this is all embedded in our R&D numbers and embedded in our long-term guidance. We don't see R&D growing faster than revenues, but we of course have a commitment to continue the innovation as a core part of the IDEXX business model. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. And one quick follow-up in terms of \u2013 Brian, for you, in terms of 3Q margin guidance. I just wanted to make sure I understood that. I heard organic growth; I heard the hedging impact year over year; is there a spot number on year-over-year margin in third quarter as we true up our models for 3Q? Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : So what I said was effectively \u2013 like you said last year was 19.7% adjusted and we'll be about 100 bps below that, so in the range of 18.7%; that was the estimate. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Perfect. Thanks, guys. Congrats again. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Nick, and I appreciate your need to do the models. We really look at it on an annual basis, and there can be a quarter-to-quarter variation, but I think it's \u2013 from our point of view, from an execution point of view, and financial point of view, we're really driving the annual growth in revenue and margin. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Great. Thanks. Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Ben Haynor with Feltl & Company. Your line is open. Ben C. Haynor - Feltl & Co.: Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the questions. First for me, you mentioned modest price realization in the prepared remarks. Any chance you could quantify the impact that the price realization might have had to the overall organic growth number? Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : For the U.S. market, we were \u2013 for recurring CAG, which is obviously the critical driver. We saw about 2% net price benefit in the quarter which is \u2013 where we think we can \u2013 we were hoping to get back to. We had moved a bit below that with some of the changes that had gone on and some of the impacts, and we think that's a good range to target and sustain going forward, and we're getting to that point now again, supported by the great innovation we're bringing to the market and also by the capability with the U.S. commercial organization to be with customers and communicate the value that we're delivering. So we think we're in a good place. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Ben, yeah. Thanks for the question. Good answer, Brian. I also want to comment that we're pleased with the progression of the customer acquisition costs. Not only do we see a continuing pretty significant moderation, it's moving more towards customer acquisition, which is not something you see inside of it. These are true \u2013 a greater percentage were actually customer acquisitions. So I think all the pricing dynamics are favorable; 2% is kind of what we expect to be the run rate here, as we continue to drive adoption and volume growth. Ben C. Haynor - Feltl & Co.: Okay. Great. And then to kind of follow up on that, is there any chance you might take it beyond 2%, just given the strong vet practice revenue growth we've seen over the last several quarters, or is that kind of where you would kind of stop? Brian P. McKeon - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Executive VP : That's a net number, so obviously, it's net of our list price changes, net of acquisition, customer acquisition impacts and things like that. We think that's a reasonable range to be in, and it'll be driven by how effective we are at communicating our value, and we think we're delivering a lot of value. But we think that range, as Jon said, is a reasonable ... Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : And just stepping back here, our purpose here is to expand the standard of care. We believe that we're still in the early days of the level of care that is delivered, and the level of care that actually pet owners will demand when they're fully informed. This is a volume-based strategy, and that's why the majority of organic growth is volume. We think 2% is reflective of the fact that our existing offerings are getting better and better, adding SDMA to the panel, and adding menu to the in-house analyzers, adding new software, new functional capabilities of SNAP Pro, we get to realize modest pricing gains. But we're really driving market expansion through primarily a volume strategy. Ben C. Haynor - Feltl & Co.: Okay. Great. Thanks for the comments. That makes sense. That's it from me. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next, we will go to line of Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey. Thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups here. Can you speak to the consumable utilization trends for SediVue? Is it tracking higher than your initial expectations? Basically, I just wanted to know if the accounts where you have placed the product, are they testing more than what you initially anticipated from a volume perspective? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Good. That's a great question. We know it's an important question. I think we're still very, very early days in the SediVue launch. And I really don't have any comments other than the earliest returns validate what we said in terms of consumable utilization, but it's just so early, given that we just started installing the instrument in April that we just would like to have a little bit more experience under our belt to be able to report that back to you. Thank you. Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And then you mentioned strong growth in the Water business, and you've highlighted it more frequently, more recently with also the product launch in the segment just this past week. Is this an area of increased investment and innovative offerings for you? How would you characterize your commitment to that business? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Erin, thank you for that question. It's a great question, because our Water business is really one of the most extraordinary business models with 95% recurring revenue; 99.9% customer retention; mid-40s operating margin; organic growth, we believe \u2013 I think Brian said in the high single-digit category. Our global Water team has delivered an exceptional first half, above our expectations, because they have really been quite entrepreneurial at pouncing on opportunities. But as Brian indicated, we believe some of those, while they're impressive on the growth, they're not \u2013 they are project-based or outbreak-based. They don't necessarily build long-term trends, but we think, high single-digit growth for the Water business is just a great outcome for such an extraordinary business model. And so we're just very, very pleased with where we are in that business, the unique value that brings and the worldwide opportunity for sustained organic growth in that business with its enduring recurring revenue profile. Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Is there a significant synergy with that business in the base business? Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it is microbiology testing. We do microbiology technology in the reference lab. It's one of the technologies that's used in the reference lab, but also gives us scale in important markets like China and other markets in Asia and South America. We have country teams that cover all of the businesses. So it is a diagnostic technology. It's a recurring revenue technology. Everybody understands the business model and how similar to the Companion Animal recurring revenue business model. So given its diagnostics, given its microbiology, I think it's a nice fit with our business. Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And with that Mr. Ayers, I'd like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments. Jonathan W. Ayers - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thank you, everybody. A couple of comments in closing. First, I want to thank everybody on the call, but I want to also thank our employees who are on the call who make IDEXX such a great company. And also I'd like to remind investors that our annual investor meeting will be broadcast live on the afternoon of August 17 and the morning of August 18, and I invite all investors to join this meeting via our live webcast. And, of course, it will also be available for replay after the event on our website. And so with that, we will conclude the call. Thank you all very much. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.",

We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue. And if time permits, we'll take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Good morning and thanks everybody for joining us today in our call. I'll be taking you through our Q3 results and our outlook for the full year, and I'll also provide an overview of our preliminary guidance for 2017. Jon will follow with his comments. We delivered 10% organic revenue growth in third quarter, driven by 12% organic growth in CAG recurring revenues and continued strong premium instrument placements, including benefits from the launch of SediVue, which contributed about 2% to overall revenue growth. EPS was $0.62 per share, up 29% as reported and 22% on an adjusted constant currency basis, with prior year third quarter results adjusted to exclude impacts from a $0.06 per share software impairment charge. Our business performance continues to track very well. Today we're updating our 2016 guidance to reflect projected performance at the high-end of our previous revenue growth and EPS ranges. We're now projecting full-year organic revenue growth of 10.5% to 11.5% and EPS of $2.35 to $2.39, or 15% to 17% reported EPS growth. Our full-year EPS outlook reflects 21% to 23% adjusted constant currency growth, supported by solid constant currency operating margin improvement. We're also raising our free cash flow outlook to about 105% of net income for the full year, reflecting strong progress in reducing inventory levels and a relatively lower outlook for capital spending. As has been our practice, we are sharing our preliminary P&L guidance for 2017 today, which reflects targeted revenue of $1.910 billion to $1.935 billion, and EPS of $2.77 to $2.93 per share. This outlook reflects expectations for 9% to 10.5% organic revenue growth overall, supported by strong organic gains in recurring CAG Diagnostics revenues. Our 2017 EPS outlook includes $0.08 to $0.12 per share of projected P&L benefit from implementing new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based compensation. Adjusting for this impact and currency changes, which will provide a $0.03 per share EPS headwind at assumed rates, our 2017 EPS outlook equates to 15% to 20% constant currency growth consistent with our long-term goals. We'll discuss our 2016 and preliminary 2017 outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with the review of our Q3 performance by segment and region. Organic growth in Q3 continue to be driven by strong global CAG gains. Global CAG revenues were $385 million, up 12% organically, reflecting strong CAG recurring diagnostic revenue gains across U.S. and international regions, and continued high global growth in instrument sales. Water revenues increased 9% organically to $28 million, driven by double-digit gains in international markets. These gains offset relatively softer performance in our LPD business, as strong growth in China and Brazil were offset by lower levels of testing related to European bovine disease eradication programs and reduced health herd screening in Asia. Overall, Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues declined 2% organically in Q3 to $30 million. By region, U.S. revenues were $277 million in the quarter, up 10%, supported by strong growth in premium instrument placements, including benefits from the launch of SediVue. U.S. CAG recurring diagnostic revenues grew 9% organically, net of about 1% of growth headwind related to pure equivalent days in the quarter. Strong U.S. CAG recurring performance was supported by continued double-digit revenue growth in our U.S. lab business and accelerating consumable gains. Recurring CAG revenue growth continues to be primarily volume-driven, aided by solid net price gains. Average net price gains for U.S. CAG recurring diagnostic revenues overall are tracking in the 2% to 3% range, supported by our significant product differentiation and enhanced commercial capability, which is resulting in relatively lower levels of discounting. Our U.S. performance continues to outpace solid U.S. market growth, as reflected in our dataset from about 5,200 clinics. In Q3, patient visits per practice increased 2.3% and revenues per practice increased 5.8% overall, with relatively stronger performance in August and September. International revenues in the second quarter were $171 million, up 11% organically, driven by 17% organic gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. The expansion of Catalyst platform globally drove international consumable revenue gains above 20% in Q3. In addition, similar to our experience in the U.S., we're seeing incremental benefits from SDMA that is supporting continued double-digit gains in lab revenues. Global instrument revenues for IDEXX were $32 million, up 22% organically, supported by 18% growth in premium instrument placements. Globally, we placed 1,214 Catalysts, 814 premium hematology analyzers, and 562 SediVues in the third quarter. In North America, we've placed 490 Catalysts with 292 or 60% at competitive or greenfield accounts. This represents a 9% year-over-year increase in competitive placements, supporting a 13% year-on-year increase in our U.S. Catalyst instrument base. Please note that in the third quarter of 2015, we benefited from placements of over 200 second Catalysts at U.S. customers, about 100 units more second Catalysts that we placed in Q3 of this year. While comparisons to higher levels of second Catalyst placements last year constrained overall Catalyst placement growth in Q3, this initiative has been very helpful in supporting continued improvement in U.S. consumable revenue retention rates, which are now tracking at 98% annualized. International instrument placement performance continues to be very strong as well, reflected in 1,211 premium instrument placements and 269 placements of VetTests. International premium instrument placements were up modestly versus very strong prior year levels, as we begin to lap the international Catalyst One launch expansion. Strong instrument placement trends continue to support high growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues were $324 million in Q3, up 12% organically. By modality, instrument revenues of $114 million grew 15% organically, supported by higher growth in both U.S. and international markets. Reference laboratory and consulting services revenues were $147 million in Q3, up 13% organically. U.S. lab revenue gains continued at a strong pace, with 12% volume-driven organic gains supported by benefits from SDMA, which continues to drive strong growth in core chemistry panels. International lab revenues also posted strong 13% organic growth, with solid performance across markets. Rapid assay revenues increased 2% organically in Q3 to $49 million. As expected, we saw some moderation in rapid assay growth related to the timing of prior year promotional programs, with overall growth supported by solid gains in 4Dx revenues. Veterinary software, services and digital imaging system revenues were $29 million in the quarter, up 7% organically, reflecting solid growth at software, service and digital recurring revenues. Turning to the P&L, strong revenue growth and a flow-through drove excellent profit results in the quarter. Please note that our Q3 2015 financial results included an $8 million software impairment charge. For purposes of the following commentary, we've excluded those impacts when we refer to adjusted comparisons for key metrics. Operating profit was $88 million, up 10% compared to adjusted prior year levels, supported primarily by gains in our CAG segment. Reported operating profit gains were mitigated by the lapping of $5 million in prior year foreign exchange hedge gains. On a constant currency basis, operating margins of 19.7% were up about 100 basis points, reflecting benefits from gross margin gains and operating expense leverage. Gross profit was $247 million in Q3, up 10% on a reported basis. Constant currency gross margin gains of 70 basis points reflected benefits from moderate price increases, favorable mix impacts from strong consumable growth, global volume leverage in reference labs, and continued improvements in our software services business. Mix impacts from higher instrument revenues partially moderated these gains. For 2016, we had a $600,000 foreign exchange hedge gain in Q3 reported in gross profit, which partially offset impacts from the lapping of the $5 million 2015 hedge gain. Operating expenses increased 10% in Q3, slightly below revenue growth levels and relatively favorable to our prior Q3 outlook, reflecting timing of investments. As noted, EPS was $0.62 per share, up 29% on a reported basis and 22% adjusting for currency impacts and the 2015 software impairment charge. The federal R&D tax credit, which benefited 2016, but not 2015 third quarter results, had a favorable 2% EPS growth impact. EPS growth continues to benefit from share repurchases, albeit at a moderated pace, which reduced year-on-year share count by 1.9%. In Q3, we repurchased 142,000 shares for $15 million. Year-to-date, we repurchased over 1.1 million shares at an average price of $79 per share. Given increases in our share price, which raises dilutive EPS impacts and moderation in share repurchases in Q2 and Q3, we expect year-on-year share count will be reduced by about 1% in Q4 and 2.5% to 3% for the full year 2016. As noted, our free cash flow is trending very well and is now projected to be about 105% of net income in 2016. This performance is supported by lower inventory levels, improved receivable metrics, and an outlook for relatively lower levels of capital spending. Our current outlook for capital spending is $80 million for 2016, or about 4.5% of revenues. Strong cash flows have supported a moderate reduction in our leverage levels. We ended Q3 with approximately $1.1 billion in debt outstanding, with an average interest rate of about 2.5%, reflecting a gross leverage ratio of 2.5 times adjusted EBITDA within our targeted 2.5 to 3 times leverage range. Cash investment balances were $391 million at quarter-end. Looking ahead, we're adjusting our full year 2016 guidance to reflect solid Q3 performance and continued strong operating trends. We're adjusting our 2016 revenue guidance range to $1.763 billion to $1.773 billion. We've updated our foreign exchange rate estimates used for guidance purposes, which resulted in a $2 million reduction in our 2016 reported revenue outlook, primarily related to erosion in the British pound. This effect partially offset an increase of $10 million to the low end of our previous revenue guidance range, reflecting solid operating trends. Our updated outlook yields of reported full year revenue growth outlook of approximately 10% to 11% and organic revenue growth of 10.5% to 11.5%. We're adjusting our 2016 EPS guidance to $2.35 to $2.39, which reflects expectations for constant currency margin gains of 21% to 23% adjusting for the 2015 software impairment. We're on track to post operating margins slightly ahead of our prior 19% full year estimate, which will result in 100 basis points or more of year-on-year constant currency improvement compared to 2015 results adjusted for the software impairment charge. As noted, we've updated our outlook for FX impacts with assumptions detailed in our press release. At the updated exchange rates, we estimate that foreign exchange rate changes will reduce year-on-year revenue growth in 2016 by about 1% and 2016 EPS by $0.20 per share, including net impacts from the lapping of $21 million in 2015 hedge gains compared to projected hedge gains of about $4 million in 2016. We continue to estimate our effective tax rate at 30.5% to 31% for the year. As we finish 2016, we're well positioned to deliver continued strong revenue and profit growth in 2017, consistent with our long-term goals. Our preliminary outlook is for 2017 revenue of $1.910 billion to $1.935 million [sic] billion (16:06), reflecting 9% to 10.5% organic growth. This outlook reflects expectations for continued strong gains in recurring CAG Diagnostics revenues, which will offset some moderating impacts as we lap very strong gains in instrument placements, and plan for relatively modest growth in LPD revenues, given current business trends. Our reported revenue outlook incorporates a 1% growth headwind from foreign exchange at the rates noted in our press release. This will reduce 2017 operating profits by about $4 million and EPS by about $0.03 per share, and create a slight headwind to reported operating margins. Our 2017 EPS outlook of $2.77 to $2.93 includes $0.08 to $0.12 per share of projected benefit from the implementation of new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based compensation. Under the new guidance, tax benefits from the exercise of stock-based compensation, which have been reflected in cash flows, will be treated now \u2013 in the future as a reduction in reported income taxes in the P&L rather than as an equity adjustment. In addition, we will no longer assume that the tax benefit is used to repurchase shares in our diluted EPS calculation. Based on stock repurchase activity over the last two years, we estimate this will be \u2013 this will reduce IDEXX's 2017 effective tax rate by \u2013 based on share-based compensation activity over the last two years, we estimate this will reduce IDEXX's 2017 effective tax rate by 250 to 350 basis points, and lower our projected year-on-year reduction in shares outstanding from repurchases by about 50 basis points. Incorporating this new accounting guidance, our preliminary outlook for our 2017 effective tax rate is 27% to 28.5%, and for a reduction in average shares outstanding from continued stock repurchases of 1% to 1.5%, net of the 0.5% accounting impact noted. We're projecting continued annual share repurchases at a relatively consistent gross leverage level of 2.5 times EBITDA. Our outlook for share count reductions from stock repurchases next year is relatively lower than our long-term goals, primarily reflecting carryover impacts from moderate repurchase activities in 2016. Adjusting for benefits from the new accounting guidance and foreign exchange impacts, our EPS outlook equates to 15% to 20% constant currency growth. This is consistent with our long-term goals and reflects a targeted 70 basis point year-on-year improvement in operating margins, net of modest headwinds associated with year-on-year FX changes. We look forward to providing an updated and more detailed review of our 2017 guidance in our year-end conference call. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the discussion over to Jon for his comments. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you, Brian, very, very comprehensive. Our strategy of bringing new innovations to our global markets through an enhanced commercial capability is solidly on track. Our strategy's continuing success along with solid continued market growth led to our achieving the 10% organic revenue growth for the company. As a whole, and as Brian pointed out, the 12% organic growth of our global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, which year-to-date comprise about 73% of our total revenues and have some of the most enduring profit characteristics. We are pleased as well that we are ahead of schedule in our progress this quarter on operating margin enhancement, as demonstrated by the 100 basis points of constant currency operating gains in Q3. Our commercial capabilities in the U.S. continued to gain momentum and we continue to make selective investments in our field-based U.S. sales and support organization, with about 40 professionals added in the last six months, bringing the total to about 375 professionals. We are expanding the field staffing even as we achieve operating expense leverage, the benefit of even stronger organic revenue growth and productivity and other parts of the P&L. We also achieved outstanding results internationally including, but not limited to, the important markets of Europe, where we saw a strong double-digit CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth, driven by the commercial investments we've made over the past few years. A couple of key performance metrics illustrate the success that I'd like to highlight. Let's talk about our North American premium instrument installed base, which continues to grow solidly as a result of several factors. First, we have achieved increasingly strong retention rates of our chemistry instrument customer base in the U.S., where we can now report that Q2 annualized retention was about 98% as measured by revenue, and our Q3 initial data indicates annualized retention is continuing at this 98% level. This is within 0.5% of the levels that we were achieving just before we announced we were going fully direct in mid-2014. Secondly, in Q3 we placed over 1,400 premium instruments in North America, an all-time quarterly high. As part of that, we continue to grow competitive and greenfield placements of Catalyst chemistry units in North America, up 9% year-over-year, as Brian mentioned. Finally, SediVue analyzer orders and placements continued to be strong. SediVue analyzer Q3 revenues benefited both from the Q3 orders and placements against the backlog going into the quarter from the launch earlier in the year. And SediVue placements contribute to growth in recurring revenue. Our current estimates indicate that a SediVue placement generates between $3,000 and $4,500 in annual recurring revenue. Continuing with the metrics, we reported exceptional global VetLab recurring revenue growth of 15% in Q3. U.S. continued to accelerate in Q3 over Q2. While we laid plan for SediVue's launch internationally, with placements beginning in UK and Australia in Q4, our teams around the world continues to make exceptional progress growing chemistry and hematology instrument installed base, upgrading VetTest customers to Catalyst, and driving the recurring revenue of instrument consumables. The exceptional international instrument consumable growth of greater than 20% is a consequence of strong placements over the past year of Catalyst One, combined with deep experienced talent in our country organizations around the world. Globally, our reference labs and consulting services reported a strong quarter of 13% organic growth, while improving our lab gross margins in the process, a contributor to the company's overall gross margin gains. In our Q2 call with investors, we'll recall how we said that our new kidney function test, IDEXX SDMA was growing our U.S. reference lab revenues through accelerated growth of requisitions that include chemistry panels. Now, with the experience of another quarter, we can see the same impact in each of our international lab markets tied with the launch of IDEXX SDMA as part of the routine chemistry panel in each market. This validates that IDEXX SDMA is supporting overall lab revenue growth by offering a unique new value to the chemistry profile. Let me provide a quick update on our new product pipeline. We are on track to introduce our PROREAD software update for SNAP Pro in Q4 this year. PROREAD will allow the device to automatically interpret results for all SNAP tests. We see increased loyalty to our rapid assay lines when customers adopt SNAP Pro into their workflow. Second, we are also on track to introduce the IDEXX SDMA test for Catalyst, for Catalyst on a Catalyst slide for in-house use in Q4 of 2017. Excitement about SDMA at the point-of-care is running high. Finally, we're on track to launch a new SNAP using antigen technology to perform in-house fecal test, currently planned for the first half of 2018. This standard preventative care test is run routinely in the practice today using microscopy, and the SNAP will be able to replace these time-consuming manual in-house methods. In addition to these previously announced innovations, we are excited to announce another menu expansion for our Catalyst platform, this time for C-reactive protein, or CRP, an inflammatory marker. We plan to launch the CRP slide in Q1 of 2017, with a focus on certain international markets. This new CRP slide highlights yet another proof point of the power of Catalyst as the platform that continues to grow in value, in part through continued market expansion, such as we've had with the additions of phenobarbital, fructosamine, the total T4 slide, and the upcoming SDMA slide. In summary, our company is executing at a high level, in line with our growth strategy, in a market with enduring growth characteristics. The momentum in the business gives us confidence in the 2017 financial guidance, as provided by Brian. And with that, we'll open the call to questions. Operator : Certainly. And we'll go to the line of Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Could you speak to the competitive dynamics across the reference laboratory business? At this point, what sort of share gains do you think are attributable to SDMA? And could you break out maybe the growth rates across the U.S. reference laboratory business and international and how we should think about, I guess, that SDMA dynamic once it's offered in clinic? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you. Let me just take the last part of that question first. We're very excited \u2013 there is a lot of excitement with our customers that we will be offering SDMA on a slide for our Catalyst platform in about a year's time. Many customers run their full chemistry panels in-house and are waiting for the opportunity to add SDMA to that panel. And so, we actually believe, as in many cases where testing begets more testing, that by offering it in-house, we're going to actually expand the awareness and the understanding of the clinic utility of SDMA. And, of course, there are many markets around the world where we don't have a ready reference lab option. And so, this will, of course, be value to our over 20,000 Catalyst customers on a global basis. The competitive environment in the U.S. is always intense. It remains intense. We operate in an environment with a very, very capable competitor. We're pleased with our double-digit U.S. gains in the reference lab. Some of that's coming from expanded utilization of our expanse of menu of tests with our existing customers. Some of it's coming from volume gains that are beyond that, and of course, we're getting some price realization. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And, Erin, we mentioned that the U.S. organic growth in labs was 12% and the international growth was 13%. Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks. And a follow-up on fundamental demand trends. You mentioned strength in August and September being, I guess, a little bit stronger. What about quarter-to-date? And do you have, I guess, any view on the sustainability of the trends here? What is reflected in your 2017 guidance as it relates to fundamental demand? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. We really see it is a steady market. I mean, we saw a nice 5.8% growth in clinic \u2013 in practice revenue that's measured by 5,200 data points, so it's a pretty good number of observations there. I think that was a pretty good number for Q3. And so, I think it's steady as she goes. We really don't \u2013 your guess is as good as ours with regard to the general economy. But I think as we look at all the trends, we see a continuation of the fundamentals we've seen in this market for the past year or two, and that's what's embedded in our outlook for 2017. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Erin, I think, year-to-date the \u2013 that same metric Jon referenced is up 6.6%. We saw market growth north of 6% in August and September. It was a little bit softer in July, but I think to Jon's point, we're seeing \u2013 we've seen continued solid trends, and that's what we're assuming next year. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: About a third of our Companion Animal Group revenues, of course, come from outside the U.S. And when we saw nice, strong double-digit recurring revenue growth in Europe \u2013 I think a market most people would say isn't the most exciting in the world \u2013 not that strong or different than the U.S. market, but it really shows that I think we can grow this market through innovation. People are willing to spend money on their pets. That is an enduring trend. And it can happen in markets around the world, and Europe being the prime example. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And to your question on SDMA, as Jon noted, we saw a similar uplift in international markets to chemistry panel growth. Now that we've got the SDMA marker, we're kind of building traction and understanding within the market. So that we're seeing the same kind of supportive benefits to our lab growth. And as a reminder, we had projected over longer term, we think, that SDMA can add about 2% to our lab growth rate. Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions and the details thus far. I wanted to ask a few follow-ups on SediVue. Jon, you mentioned in your prepared comments, I believe you're seeing consumable streams annually run at $3,000 to $4,500. I'm curious if you can remind us how that is trending, one, versus expectations, and number two, if there's any confounding factors there like the early adopters perhaps driving better growth of being bigger clinics. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you. First of all, the market response to SediVue has been really quite impressive, combined with, I think, an extraordinarily capable commercial organization in North America. And I think we're hitting a \u2013 we're addressing a pain point of manual urinalysis or the issues associated with sending out samples and seeing the decay in the clinical value of urine as it passes over time and analyzed at the reference lab. So we're very pleased with the placements. What we're doing is we're giving you early indicators of what we believe to be the consumable growth per placement, and we are very excited about the long-term outlook for SediVue, given that we're selling SediVue into practices large, medium and small. And so, the $3,000 to $4,500 is within the range that we provided before we'd launched SediVue and didn't have any field experience. And we wanted just to provide a little bit more refinement on that now that we've got four, five months of \u2013 really actually only four to five months of experience in the field. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then I guess a follow-up on that. Is SediVue opening up IDEXX to new accounts? Or maybe asked differently, are SediVue installs yet going to new customers, given the novelty of that product and some of the workflow benefits, or have you focused more with the sales on just meeting demand from your existing customers, and then the share gains could be in quarters to come? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you. I believe that SediVue was one of many contributors to the 9% growth in competitive Catalyst placements. But, of course, we have large number of IDEXX customers that want to adopt the newest technology, and so we want to serve them too. So, a portion, less than 50% \u2013 well, less than 50%, a portion of those SediVues are going to accounts that do not have our other in-house equipment, and sometimes they add. The other in-house equipment is part of the placements. Sometimes that equipment comes later, because, of course, once we place the SediVue into an account which doesn't have in-house equipment, they get the IDEXX VetLab Station -- comes with it, and they begin to see and appreciate that highly differentiated value of our integrated offering and things like VetConnect PLUS. It really opens the conversation to differentiators. So, clearly, SediVue along with innovations such as SDMA is giving us access to accounts that want to learn about this technology, an access that we didn't previously have when we were talking about our more traditional in-house chemistry and hematology. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next we'll go to the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good morning. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Morning. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Just on the tax adjustment, so my understanding is \u2013 and this is going to be something that's going to be recurring going forward, so we should think about the lower tax rate in 2018 and beyond? Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yes, that's right. This is \u2013 to make it a little simpler to understand, in our cash flow statement you'll see the tax benefits that flow from when employees exercise their stock-based compensation. And going forward, this change has no impact on cash flow, but now \u2013 it used to flow through equity, now it will flow through the P&L. There's a little bit of an offset, where in our diluted EPS calculation you would assume that cash flow will be used to repurchase shares, and that will no longer be the case going forward. So, that $0.01 per share benefit that we gave is the net of those two numbers. I would highlight this is going to \u2013 it's not easy to predict. It's going to vary quarter by quarter. We're putting out a reasonable estimate based on the activity by quarter we've seen the last couple of years. We'll, obviously, talk and be transparent about that each quarter, but it is something that's going to be a little more volatile in terms of the metric. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And, Derik, just to highlight it. I think Brian is \u2013 every company is going to have this... Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: ...a change in the accounting for taxes associated with the options, new guidance. We just want \u2013 given that we provide 2017 guidance at this point, we wanted to be very transparent as to what is the impact of this versus the fundamentals of the company. It's just consistent with the way we like to do business. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : No, thanks. Appreciate the color on that. And if I can do one quick follow-up. When you sort of look at your international, and particularly in the UK, are you embedding anything in terms of potential slowdown because of currency movements in the UK or just general consumer weakness in UK? And just sort of how do you think about the UK in 2017? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Our UK business is on fire. I can't believe how strong. We have an unbelievable team there, and we are not seeing anything. I mean, the only thing we're seeing, of course, is the currency translation effect. But in terms of the impact, what's interesting about this business is the economy might affect it, but our growth rates are so strong. We grew 5% organically in 2009, which was, of course, was a terrible year globally. And so, I think what's happening in the UK is a combination of all of our innovations with a very, very strong team is really coming together for us, from reference lab to in-house, the launch of SediVue at the London Vet Show. It's very exciting. I mean, it's a great team and they really are clicking on all cylinders. And so we don't really see any \u2013 I don't think we really \u2013 I don't know if we could even tell if there was an economic impact, but we certainly haven't seen any in our numbers. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go to the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys, and good morning. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Good morning, Jon. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: First of all, Brian, maybe for you. If you can just talk to the normalized 70 bps and expected op margin expansion in 2017 versus, I think, you called out normalized of about 100 bps in 2016. Really just trying to figure out if maybe that's a sense of conservatism or why the op margin expansion would be slightly less than 2017. Arguably, you're leveraging the direct sales force, and I also think you'll have a lower mix in instrument revs in 2017 versus 2016. Thanks. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, those are great points. The 70 bps is basically right at the midpoint of the range that we've been highlighting, the 50 to 100 basis points. There's a little bit of foreign exchange headwind that's taken it down slightly. This is our preliminary guidance. I think we feel good about trends in the business and we do have positive drivers. As you've noted, we feel comfortable at this point with that outlook. I would highlight, Jon, that we've made significant progress this year reducing inventories, and there's a bit of an absorption headwind that goes along with that. It's a good news story from a cash flow and business management point of view. It's just there's some temporal impacts on the margin side. We'll peel all of this apart more at year-end. But, I think we're comfortable that we're on track with our long-term goals and can build on the strong operating margin improvements that we had this year. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, Jon, I would also say that, reinforcing Brian's comments, we're very focused on things like gross margin improvement in our businesses, labs, and the VetLab business being the largest one, and some operating expense leverage, but we're also \u2013 the growth is a good thing. Organic growth is a good thing, and so we don't want to constrain investments that are going to generate enduring organic revenue growth. So, when you take it all together, that's our first step for 2017. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Perfect, very helpful. And maybe, Jon, just to sort of follow-up on that. You mentioned I think the 40 professionals added over, I believe you said the last six months, sort of maybe a plus 12% count of the sales force in North America. I believe now it totals 375. Can you just give some details where those reps were added as a broad base? Are they specialists? And then when we look forward, do you think that it really right-sizes where you need to be with the organization? Thanks, guys. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, thank you for that question. They were in two primary areas. One is we have an elite group of professional service veterinarians. We have literally hired the best across the industry, and we are now at a full complement of 23. These are field-based professional service veterinarians that run dinner meetings, run CE, call on customers, talk about the benefit of things like SDMA and our clinical advantages, talk about the importance of adding urinalysis to the minimum database and supporting SediVue. And we now have a full complement of one per region, which reduces their size of geography and allows them to be highly productive. We think it's a really important part of the fact that we're bringing new clinical differentiation to the industry. The other area is an amazing group of field of support representatives. These are typically very highly capable, either lead technicians of very large practices or practice managers, and we have now moved to 89 of those in place and they are set-up to be one for every two VDC territory, so several per region. And this, of course, shrinks their territories and allows them to be more productive. These are essential in things like our two-way integration and the integration of SNAP Pro, the adoption of VetConnect PLUS, but of course, they are involved in instrument installations and lab on-boarding. They're not commissioned. They get great \u2013 rave reviews from our customers when they show up, because they provide a lot of value, and they're completely unique to the model of someone in our category of bringing value to the customer. So, those were really the two areas that we filled out to get to a set that matches our regions and our veterinary diagnostic territory managed coverage. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And, Jon, to your question, I think we're heading towards a good place in terms of our staffing levels. There'll be some year-over-year carryover as we increase some of the levels this year. I would highlight that we do have some enabling investments going on. As we're expanding the team, we've got an investment in a CRM system that we're putting in place, HRS system. So, it's all within our outlook for margin improvement, but we do have some enabling investments that we're advancing in parallel. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And then I might just finally add that, even with those investments, we've achieved nice leverage in our operating expense in Q3 in the U.S. CAG business. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Understood. Thanks for the color, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. First one from me in terms of 2017 organic growth guidance. I know you'll provide more specifics on the segments, I believe, in January or February when you report full year. But I just wanted to get a better understanding of just some of the other segments, Water, LPD. Obviously, Water has been quite strong this year. LPD moderated a bit in 3Q. And I'm just trying to get a better understanding of, if we look at that organic growth guidance for the full year next year, is there any change in terms of CAG outside of just instrument dynamics that we should be aware of or is the \u2013 perhaps the slight deceleration year-over-year on organic growth more attributed to the other segments versus CAG? Thanks. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: We, obviously, will get more into the color by modality on the year-end call. We did highlight a few things today just as color. One was, we are anticipating continued strong CAG recurring diagnostic growth, which is the key driver of our business. As you noted, we'll be up against some tougher compares on instruments. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: SediVue launch. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, the SediVue launch post-Q1. And we did note that LPD is trending relatively softer. We're seeing good growth in expansion regions and in emerging markets. But, I think the long awaited kind of slowdown in the disease eradication testing in Europe, we're seeing \u2013 quote \u2013 the numbers and there has been a lower level of health herd screening testing, which is into China primarily, and that is a small business, but a little more volatile relatively in the contrast of our overall. So, those were just the factors we're highlighting. But net-net, I think it's much more of a consistent growth story. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, and I want to thank you for calling out our Water business. They had yet another great quarter. I think we have a very entrepreneurial team, very focused on our customers. They've done a great job this year. And we continue to see \u2013 there's a good market for our core products in Water in the U.S. and around the world. And so, just an awesome business with \u2013 it's 95% recurring revenue, 99%-plus, 99.5%; 99.9% customer loyalty and retention and mid-40s operating margin. That's a great business for us. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. And then my second question would be on net price realization. It seems like you guys have made some real progress over the last couple of quarters as you've navigated through this commercial reorganization. But I think that 2% to 3% has been the strongest and sometimes \u2013 I just wanted to get a little bit more \u2013 a better understanding on kind of sustainability. Obviously that has positive ramifications as you think about gross margin improvement longer term. Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I think there's two things that really are benefiting from the fact that customers are appreciating that IDEXX's offering and diagnostics is very unique. And it's unique because the innovations first and only innovations that we brought to the market that customers are adopting. So, we see an improved customer retention that I mentioned, and the flip side of the coin is we see it in modest price realization. We offer SDMA at no incremental charge as part of the standard reference lab panel. This allows us to get some modest price differentiation, because it's now highly differentiated offering and a major part of the reference lab offering. So, I think those two dynamics are two good things that are consequence of the adoption of the innovation by our customers. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go to the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. My first is on the rate of international growth that you have in your forecast for 2017. Obviously, you had a blowout Q2, 18% premium placement revenue growth in Q3. Is it reasonable for us to model in double-digit instrument growth in 2017, or do you think you're more likely to come in a hair below that? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, I don't really want to talk about \u2013 we're not just ready to talk about details of the different parts of the P&L in 2017. I think it's pretty amazing actually we give 2017 guidance. I don't think too many companies actually do that. But what I will say with regard to international is it'll benefit from the SediVue launch. Most of the SediVue launches \u2013 two important countries, UK and Australia, are happening in Q4. Obviously, they'll really get rolling in 2017, but we'll be launching SediVue around the world over the course of 2017. So, that will be a nice contributing factor to international's performance. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: We feel very good about the trends internationally. We'll, obviously, be up against some very strong numbers on the Catalyst placements this year. So just on a reported, we're looking to sustain strong performance, but I think the growth rates, that'll obviously be something we'll factor into the outlook. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And I'll also mention, as I mentioned earlier, that about a third of our Companion Animal Group revenues are outside the U.S. In terms of the SediVue opportunity, obviously, the big opportunity is the launch that we had in the U.S. or North America. And so the opportunity for SediVue is going to be smaller international, just as the entire market opportunity is small. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. And then as a follow-up to SediVue, was wondering if you could comment about where you expect to launch beginning in 2017 beyond UK and Australia. I have to imagine it's probably across other European countries, where you're direct would be my guess and perhaps in maybe Brazil or other faster-growing territories. Any color there would be helpful. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Obviously, we're going to be \u2013 what I'll make as a general comment, the countries where we have more experience, more \u2013 where we're direct, that are larger, these are the markets that we'll roll out first. UK and Australia, obviously, are characteristic of that. They're also, of course, English language countries. And we'll be rolling \u2013 it rolls out over the course of 2017. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next we'll go to the line of David Westenberg with C.L. King. Your line is open. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, most of my questions have already been asked, so I'll just do the one I have left on SediVue. Can you talk about the way you're looking at utilization in existing in-house chemistry accounts? Sort of asked another way, do you have an initial revenue per Catalyst estimate that you're looking at with the increase of the SDMA slide? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: So, yeah. So, they are related. Okay? SediVue, we think the \u2013 the early data that we're showing is the $3,000 to $4,500 per analyzer placement. And on SDMA on a slide, we're still a year away from launch, and we will be charging, of course, for the slide. So, it will be a source of revenue. But we're still quite a ways from that. It won't be a meaningful contributor to 2017 revenue, given the launch will be in the fourth quarter of the year. But what I will tell you is it's bringing a tremendous amount of excitement to not only our existing Catalyst base, but to those customers who are considering upgrading to a Catalyst from their current analyzer, be it an IDEXX VetTest or competitive analyzer. And many of those customers are using IDEXX reference labs already and getting the benefit of SDMA. And then, to know that they could also use SDMA on their in-house lab if they upgraded to an IDEXX Catalyst is \u2013 and to know that that's going to happen in 2017, I think will be beneficial to our competitive Catalyst placements leading up to that launch date. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Great. And just a quick follow-up on that. Do you think that you're going to see an increase in SDMA spend as we anticipate the SDMA launch? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I'm sorry. Ask that question again. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Do you anticipate increasing your sales and marketing spend on SDMA in anticipation of the launch on the Catalyst? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: No. I don't think \u2013 I think we're \u2013 what we've talked about in terms of a great field force that we have today supplemented by the professional service veterinarians and the expansion that we've now completed was really an amazing group. The best of the best in the industry have decided to come to IDEXX, because we're by far the most innovative company in the U.S. market, regardless of what product lines. There's more to talk about with IDEXX, and that's what is exciting, is actually changing the course of veterinary medicine. And so, we're already, I think, well facilitated to launch the SDMA on a slide with the resources that we have in place today. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. We will go the line of Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Can you speak to sort of the opportunity associated with that CRP launch that you mentioned that's going to launch in the first quarter? Are the contributions embedded in your long-term guidance or is this incremental? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, thank you. CRP is a really interesting test, but the test is well understood and appreciated in certain international markets. And, Erin, in the long term, we don't see any reason why it couldn't be appreciated in all markets, because after all dogs and cats are the same around the world in terms of inflammatory markets, but it's not as appreciated in the U.S. Our focus in the U.S. is going to be on the assays that we already have in the market, things like SDMA and fecal antigen. But we're going to be offering the slide. A point is there are certain international markets where CRP has already been adopted. And so, we're going to be launching it worldwide, but it is not going to be \u2013 we don't believe it to be a material at all, or a meaningful contributor to our recurring revenue. It will be an incremental value to the Catalyst in placements in these international markets that already see the value of CRP. And in the long term, we have the opportunity of expanding the appreciation of CRP in other markets including the U.S. Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, great. And then one last one. How are your relationships with corporate teams progressing? Any updates on your relationship with Banfield, NVA or other chains out there? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you. I think we have \u2013 really we don't comment on individual customers, but we have outstanding relationships. It's interesting. The corporate accounts appreciate the value of our differentiators as much as the individual accounts on two dimensions. The first is these help them to grow their revenue. And second of all, their doctors are seeing the changing standard of cares that we're bringing to the industry and they want to make their doctors happy. And so, we have a great corporate account team, which, by the way, isn't even included in the 375. It's another group of very experienced IDEXX field professionals. And I think there's really no individual comment I would have. So I'd say, I think our corporate account team is executing very well. We are also doing that around the world. There are corporate accounts in markets around the world and we are attending to their needs. Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to the speakers for any closing comment. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you very much. We appreciate everybody's addition to the \u2013 coming on to the call. As I said, our company is executing on all key dimensions. And I just continue to be amazed by our employees' innovation and entrepreneurial spirit, and continue to believe that our unique IDEXX culture consists \u2013 that this entrepreneurial spirit is one of our most competitive advantages. So, I want to thank all of our employees for yet another great quarter and for the work that we're doing to expand the standard of care and support veterinarians in their quest to support the health and well-being of the pets and the families that love them around the world. So with that, we're going to conclude the call. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you.

I'm pleased to take you through our fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results and to provide an update on our financial outlook for 2017. We had very strong results in Q4 which concluded a year of exceptional financial performance for IDEXX in 2016. We achieved 12% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter supported by 13% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and continued strong gains in premium instrument placements supported by the expansion of SediVue, which contributed about 2% to overall revenue growth. Our full-year organic revenue growth was 11.4%, about 3% above our original 2016 growth goal entering the year. These results were supported by 12% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues reflecting strong double-digit growth in both US and International markets. Our full-year EPS was $2.44 above the high end of our guidance range, reflecting strong topline results and operating margin gains. In 2016 we achieved a 19.7% operating margin, a 170 basis point increase on an adjusted constant currency basis, reflecting solid gross margin gains and significant operating expense leverage. EPS grew 25% on an adjusted constant currency basis in 2016, well above our long-term financial goals. Our operating trends position us well to deliver strong constant currency revenue and EPS growth in 2017 consistent with our long-term goals. We'll provide an update on our 2017 guidance later in the call. Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results beginning with an overview of regional performance. We achieved strong organic growth in US and International regions in the fourth quarter driven by continued momentum in expanding our Companion Animal business. US revenues were $268 million in the quarter, up 12% organically. Gains were driven by continued strong premium instrument placements and 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues reflecting our strongest quarterly US growth performance in 2016 in this important annuity revenue stream. US recurring revenue gains were supported by continued strong double-digit growth in reference labs, accelerated double-digit consumable gains and solid growth in rapid assay sales. US CAG recurring diagnostic price gains continued to trend in the 2% to 3% range with the bulk of our growth driven by volume. IDEXX's performance significantly outpaced solid US veterinary practice market growth in Q4, reflected in our data set from \u2013 about 5,200 clinics. In Q4 patient visits increased 1.4% and clinic revenues increased 5.6% compared to the prior year period, somewhat similar to Q2 and Q3 market growth trends. For the full year, US revenues reached $1.09 billion driven by over $1 billion in US CAG revenues, a significant milestone for the company. We achieved US organic growth of 11% in 2016 driven by an increase of 11% in US CAG, supported by 10% CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains and strong growth in premium instrument placements. Instrument revenues in Q4 were $175 million up 11% organically. International results were driven by 16% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues reflecting continued strong consumable gains supported by our expanding Catalyst instrument base. International revenues reached $686 million for the full-year or 39% of total IDEXX revenues reflecting organic gains of 12%. For the full-year international CAG revenues reached $506 million up 16% organically. International CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues also increase 16% organically for the year reflecting strong double-digit growth across Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions. Overall international gains were moderated by modest growth in our international LPD business. Turning to segment performance our Q4 results benefited from strong premium instrument placements reflecting global expansion of our Catalyst instrument base and continued strong momentum with SediVue. Global instrument revenues for IDEXX were at $35 million, up 24% organically supported by 15% growth in premium instrument placements. Globally we've placed 1,493 catalysts, 1,128 premium hematology analyzers, and 546 SediVues in the first quarter. Catalyst and premium hematology placements were down modestly compared to very strong prior-year levels which included benefits from nearly 200 second Catalyst placements in the U.S. related to our successful customer retention programs. In North America we have placed 524 Catalysts in Q4 with 347 or 66% at competitive or greenfield accounts consistent with our commercial focus. Catalyst retention rates remain very high at 98%. The U.S. Catalyst consumable revenue now represents 98% of total chemistry consumable revenues excluding corporate accounts. International instrument placement performance continues to be very strong reflected in 1,783 premium instrument placements including our initial placements of SediVue in the U.K. and Australia. For the full-year, we placed 5,198 Catalysts, 3,699 premium hematology analyzers, and 1,575 SediVues globally; nearly 10,500 premium instrument placements in total representing growth of 21%. Strong instrument placement trends supported continued global expansion of our instrument base. We ended 2016 with an active install base of 24,500 Catalysts. Our install Catalyst instrument base increased 23% globally in 2016 supported by 11% year-on-year growth in the U.S. and 40% gains in international markets. In fact our international Catalyst base is now nearly as large as our U.S. Catalyst base. Global expansion of our premium instrument base sets the foundation for continued strong gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. In Q4 global CAG Diagnostic revenues were $312 million up 13% organically. For the full year of 2016 CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues reached nearly $1.3 billion or 72% of total IDEXX revenue. CAG recurring annuity growth reflected strong gains across modalities reflecting the multiplier effect of strong premium instrument placements, benefits from new test innovation and excellent execution by our global commercial organizations. Reference laboratory and consulting services with revenues of $141 million grew 13% organically in the fourth quarter supported by 13% organic gains in both U.S. and international markets. Instrument consumable revenues of $115 million in Q4 grew 18% organically supported by continued very strong gains in international markets and accelerated double-digit growth in the U.S. including building benefits from the expansion of SediVue. Rapid assay revenues increased 6% organically in Q4 to $42 million supported by continued solid gains in SNAP 4Dx and stabilized volume trends in first-generation products. Livestock poultry and dairy revenue of $33 million declined modestly in Q4, as solid gains in recurring revenues supported by emerging-market expansion and growth of our pregnancy platform were offset by declines in bovine disease eradication testing in Europe and lower health herd screening revenues. For the full-year our LPD revenues were $126 million, up 1% organically. For 2017, we are planning for flat to modest growth in LPD overall as we continue to work through pressures from year-on-year comparisons in these select product lines. Our water business revenues grew 3% organically in the fourth quarter. As expected we saw moderation in our Q4 growth reflecting impacts from channel inventory adjustments in advance of a go-direct initiative in Brazil as well as lapping of strong prior-year sales associated with the launch of our Quanti-Tray Sealer PLUS product and the crypto outbreak in the U.K. For the full-year water business revenues increased $104 million, up 9% organically. We're very pleased with our momentum in the water business and we believe we're on track for continued high single digit organic revenue gains in this highly profitable business in 2017. Turning to the P&L, gross profit was $241 million in Q4, up 11% on a reported basis. Adjusted for foreign exchange impacts including the lapping of $6 million in prior-year foreign exchange hedge gains gross margins increased 90 basis points, reflecting solid net price gains and volume leverage from strong consumable and reference lab growth. Foreign exchange hedge gains reported in gross profit were $2 million in Q4. For the full-year 2016, foreign exchange hedge gains were $4 million or a benefit of about $0.03 per share. Operating profit in Q4 was $84 million, up 25% as reported reflecting an increase of 35% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit results benefited from strong revenue gains and operating expense leverage. Operating expenses in Q4 were up 3% driven by investment in sales and marketing resources and enabling information technology. Q4 expense growth was lower than projected reflecting timing of select head count additions and benefits from favorable year-on-year accrual comparisons. For the full year operating profit was $350 million, this reflects an operating margin of 19.7% or an increase of 170 basis points on a constant currency basis compared to 2015 levels adjusted to exclude the prior year software impairment charge. This very strong full-year result reflected about 40 basis points of constant currency gross margin gains and 130 basis points of benefits from operating expense leverage reflecting our strong topline performance and high returns from global sales and marketing investments. EPS in Q4 was $0.58 per share. For 2016, adjusted EPS was $2.44 up 19% as reported and 25% on a comparable constant currency basis, adjusted to exclude the impacts from the 2015 software impairment charge. For the full year foreign exchange rate changes reduced revenue growth by less than 1% and operating profit by $24 million primarily reflecting the lapping of $21 million in 2015 hedge gains. Combined with tax rate impacts, foreign exchange created a $0.20 per share headwind to full-year 2016 reported EPS results. Free cash flow was $284 million for 2016 or 128% of net income. This very strong performance reflected benefits from strong working capital management including a $30 million reduction in inventory from relatively higher 2015 ending levels and improvements in DSO. We also benefited from controlled capital spending timing, including favorable impacts from timing of investments which resulted in full-year capital spending of $65 million or 3.7% of revenues. Our cash flow performance in 2016 builds on strong long-term trends for the Company reflecting the strength of our business model and focus. Of note, over the last five years free cash flow has averaged 102% of net income including effects related to our transition to a fully direct commercial model in the U.S. Our strong cash flows and continued positive business momentum supported allocation of $225 million in capital towards share repurchases in Q4. In the quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares. This brought our full year repurchase levels to nearly 3.1 million shares reflecting a deployment of $313 million in 2016 at an average price of $102 per share. We ended 2016 with $1.207 billion in debt outstanding. At year end, we had $392 million in cash and investment balances, and $238 million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of EBITDA were 2.7 times gross and 1.8 times net of cash and investment balances at year end. We anticipate maintaining gross leverage ratios in the 2.5 times to 3.0 times range in 2017 with continued deployment of excess cash flow towards share repurchases. Our solid finish to 2016 positions us well to deliver continued strong constant currency revenue and profit growth in 2017 consistent with our long-term goals. In terms of organic revenue growth, we're maintaining our outlook for 9% to 10.5% gains in 2017. This results in consistent reported revenue guidance of $1.910 billion to $1.935 billion as benefits from strong final Q4 performance were offset by updated rate assumptions for foreign exchange which are reflected in our press release. Overall, at the new assumed FX rates we project that our reported revenue growth will be reduced by 1.5% in 2017 related to the year-on-year strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our strong revenue growth outlook is supported by expectations for 10.5% to 11.5% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues driven by double-digit gains in reference lab and consumable revenues and continued solid growth in rapid assay. While we're targeting continued high level of premium instrument placements year-on-year growth in instrument revenues will moderate compared to very strong 2016 performance. Today we're raising our 2017 EPS outlook to $2.85 to $3.01, an increase of $0.08 per share to reflect approximately $0.07 per share in flow-through benefits from strong 2016 operating profit performance and $0.04 of benefit from updated estimates related to the implementation of new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based compensation. These positive factors offset about $0.03 of additional EPS headwind related to our updated FX estimates. As noted in our last earnings call under the new accounting guidance, tax benefits from the exercise of stock-based compensation which have been reflected in cash flows will be treated as a reduction in reported income taxes in the P&L going forward rather than as an equity adjustment. In addition we will no longer assume that the tax benefit is used to repurchase shares in our diluted EPS calculation. Based on analysis of vesting stock option grants and historical exercise activity, we now estimate that implementation of this new guidance will increase 2017 EPS by $0.12 to $0.16 to per share. This reflects a projected reduction of 350 to 450 basis points in IDEXX's 2017 effective tax rate offset by projected reduction in shares outstanding from estimated share repurchases of about 50 basis points. Incorporating these new estimates our preliminary outlook for our 2017 effective tax rate is 26% to 27.5% assuming no change in U.S. corporate tax policy. Our outlook for share count in 2017 is for a reduction in average shares outstanding from continued stock repurchases of about 1.5% net of the 0.5% accounting impact noted. This is a relatively higher benefit than estimated in our preliminary guidance reflecting share repurchases in Q4. As noted we expect to maintain our gross leverage levels at 2.5 to 3 times EBITDA in 2017 resulting in projected net interest expense of $32 million to $33 million. Foreign exchange impacts related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar will continue to be a variable impacting our financial performance in 2017. We've updated our financial outlook to reflect more recent exchange rates, which have weakened relative to dollars since we issued our preliminary guidance. At the updated exchange rates, outlined in our press release, we estimate that foreign exchange rates will reduce our reported year-on-year revenue growth in 2017 by about 1.5% and EPS by about $0.06 per share net of approximately $7 million in currently projected hedge gains. We estimate that a 1% change in value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies will result in a $7 million-change in 2017 revenue and a $2 million-change in 2017 operating profit net of hedges. Please note this sensitivity is on a full-year basis. Without the hedges the full year operating profit sensitivity would be about $3 million. Adjusting for benefits from the new accounting guidance and foreign exchange impacts our EPS outlook is consistent with our long-term goals of 15% to 20% constant currency EPS growth. This outlook reflects a targeted 70 basis point year-on-year improvement in operating margins on a reported basis, net of modest headwinds associated with year-on-year FX changes. This is also consistent with our long-term target of 50 to 100 basis points of annual constant currency operating margin improvement. Free cash flow is projected at about 95% of net income for 2017. Note that the implementation of the new accounting guidance for stock-based compensation which raises reported net income but has no impact on cash flow will reduce this metric by about 5% going forward. So this equates to about 100% of net income under previous GAAP. Our 2017 outlook reflects projected capital spending of $90 million. In terms of our first quarter outlook in 2017, we expect Q1 reported revenue growth in the 8.5% to 10% range reflecting organic gains of 10% to 11% offset by 1% to 1.5% of FX headwind. While we'll be facing some tougher growth comparisons related to a very strong prior-year first quarter which included benefits from leap year, we will be benefited from solid momentum heading into the year and expect to see year-on-year upside from SediVue instrument revenues in Q1. Recall that we didn't start shipping SediVues until last year's second quarter. Year-on-year operating margin in Q1 is expected to be about 50 basis points up compared to reported 2016 Q1 levels. That concludes the financial overview, let me turn the call over to Jon for his comments on our business performance and our areas of focus heading into 2017. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you, Brian. It was indeed an exceptional Q4 completion to an exceptional 2016. Our strategy is all about enduring growth supported by a growing global market for pet healthcare combined with a combination of continuous improvement and continuously strengthening customer relationships. The year 2016 showed the potential we have with the strategy completing a year of 11.4% organic growth driven by 12% in organic growth of CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue, which comprises of 72% of the Company's total revenue. Of note Q4 for this recurring metric was a bit over 13% organically the highest growth for the four quarters of the year showing the momentum we are sustaining in the business model. We're seeing the benefits of world-class sales and marketing in our global markets coming on the heels of a series of investments we have made over the last several years to position ourselves with a direct presence in our markets. Our International Companion Animal commercial organization had a phenomenal year in 2016. International Companion Animal Diagnostic recurring revenue grew 16% led by the over 20% growth in VetLab instrument consumables. Clearly, our 2016 recurring revenue growth is benefiting from a strong number of Catalyst One placements for the past two years. And yet we're still early days for Catalyst One penetration internationally even as we embark on the SediVue launch in global markets. We launched SediVue in the U.K. and in Australia in Q4 2016, commencing an international launch that will roll out over the course of 2017. Our Reference Labs also grew 13% organically internationally where we're seeing the benefits of SDMA and other investments in our global Reference Lab network. This solid volume led growth contributed also to the expansion of our global lab gross margins, a metric where we see opportunity for years to come. Focusing on the U.S. companion animal market, we're also delivering impressive revenue growth. A combination of our new innovations and expanded presence with customers is not only growing our share of customers who use IDEXX as their diagnostic partner, but also the growing the market for diagnostics through increased customer utilization. Clearly with U.S. companion animal recurring revenue diagnostics showing full year growth in double-digits the strength of our fully direct model is proving out. Looking back on 2016, our U.S. field sales and support organization made over 250,000 in-person visits with veterinary practices, or an average of approximately 10 visits for every practice in the U.S. This kind of frequency is what builds enduring trust and our ability to support practices growing utilization of our advanced diagnostics in providing high quality care. We also had very high occupancy rate in our veterinary diagnostic consultant territories, which is so important for consistent customer presence. This occupancy rate averaged 99.5% over the course of the year, world-class levels of territory occupancy. Our research on U.S. customer satisfaction with IDEXX shows a strong trajectory in 2016 over prior years, further validated by an independent study of industry sales force effectiveness where IDEXX really stood out. In 2017, we plan to continue to augment and deepen our U.S. field sales and service presence, while at the same time achieving operating expense leverage. We can do both because of the rates of recurring revenue growth. We see the outcomes of our 2016 U.S. and Canadian sales coverage in a number of areas. Let me just list a few. First, continued strong performance in placements and chemistry analyzers and new and competitive accounts nearly 1,200 for the full-year. Second, placements of over 1,500 SediVue instruments, an entirely new instrument launched in 2016 that generates a novel recurring revenue annuity. Third, an all-time record number of placements of digital radiography units in Q4. And speaking of digital radiography, we have reached almost 1,500 customer subscribers with our cloud-based digital software called IDEXX-PACS which is only one of five of our subscription-based SaaS offerings. Loyalty and retention metrics across all CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue modalities improved every quarter in 2016. Low customer churn is one of the most important performance metrics for our recurring revenue model. We also continue to grow our U.S. reference lab customer count or the number of practices that sent at least one sample to us during a six-month period. Two years ago before we started the journey to an expanded field sales organization that came with the U.S. fully direct implementation our customer count was about 58% of U.S. practices. And while this is an impressive level of penetration, it has since grown to 65% at the end of 2016. Clearly our strategy of covering the market with dedicated veterinary diagnostic consultants and offering expanded and unique menu of tests is expanding our reference lab presence in the market. Once a customer has used IDEXX for any of their reference lab needs, our sales representatives can work to expand that utilization to more diagnostic categories with the goal of eventually becoming the customers' primary or sole reference lab provider. While the most visible innovation we have added to the reference labs is with SDMA we also have several other areas of unique innovation including our fecal antigen test to find more intestinal worms not otherwise diagnosed and offerings in cardiac, molecular diagnosis, pancreatitis and several other categories of differentiated menu. Speaking of SDMA we are targeting an end of year launch for SDMA on Catalyst. Our market research shows extremely strong interest among our Catalyst customers with over 90% of surveyed Catalyst customers saying IDEXX was necessary on their Catalyst and two thirds likely to purchase. We will be offering SDMA for customer, for Catalyst customers in two forms. As a single slide that they can add together with a chemistry panel in a single run or in a combo kit with our T4 slide again to run with the chemistry panel in a single run as customers do with our T4 single slide today. I'm very excited to announce that for practices that are buying the T4 slide today for the Catalyst they can add the SDMA slide in a combo kit at no incremental costs to the T4 slide. This offer is highly relevant. To-date two thirds of our US Catalyst customers already use the T4 slide and T4 is an essential diagnostic marker for thyroid disease, a major concern in both the dog and the cat. If customers want to run SDMA as part of the chemistry panel that does not include T4 the SDMA slide pricing will be akin to adding an additional single slide to a Catalyst panel today in a way that is designed to encourage adoption and also augmenting VetLab recurring revenue per Catalyst installation. We often get the question, will our introduction of SDMA in-house cannibalize, if you will, our reference lab volumes and the answer is quite the opposite. Testing always begets testing. In addition, we have a number of customers who use us for in-house testing around the world but don't use IDEXX for their send out testing. To summarize on SDMA, customer appreciation for this remarkable addition to the chemistry panel is growing every quarter. We believe the launch of SDMA on a slide will lead to a relatively rapid ramp to adoption by our Catalyst customer base, increase loyalty, generate incremental revenue from utilization, not impact our reference lab volumes and yet perhaps most importantly, introduce SDMA to a whole new segment of customers who don't yet use our reference labs for chemistry profiles. We find that once a customer experiences the benefit of SDMA in their practice with a specific patient and thus seeing better outcomes they realize they don't want to run chemistry panels without it whether in-house or sending out. We are bringing a number of other innovations to the market in 2017, let me just update on three. First for our SediVue customers later this quarter we will update their instrument software using a second-generation algorithm that benefits from the 14 million images we received in the IDEXX cloud since the launch of SediVue. A reminder to investors, all of our SediVue customers are connected to IDEXX through the Internet sort of an Internet of Things strategy, if you will, using our proprietary SmartService technology. These 14 million images are 30 times the roughly 450,000 images we used to develop the first generation of the algorithm and will further advance the capabilities of the algorithm and the customer experience with SediVue. This is one of the most profound and unique advantages of our instrument business model. We can use big data, sourced from the field and machine learning to continually advance capabilities of an instrument such as SediVue DX and then automatically upgrade the instruments in the field in the background through SmartService. In this way the platform for existing and new customers just gets better and better with time and more big data. Second, we have launched the PROREAD software update for SNAP Pro. PRORREAD allows SNAP Pro to automatically interpret results for all SNAP tests. We see increased loyalty to our rapid assay lines when customers adopt SNAP Pro into their workflow which supports continued growth of this diagnostic modality. Third, our unique cloud-based VetConnect PLUS offering continues to gain adoption even as it grows in capabilities for our customers. We saw over 25% growth in engaged customers in 2016 to well over 14,000 globally and total connected customers with VetConnect PLUS is over 32,000. We see growing views of radiographs through VetConnect PLUS and growth in VetConnect PLUS usage across all modalities, web, mobile and within the practice management software. Our VetConnect PLUS functionality and geographic coverage continues to grow as a result of continuous investment in this unique global cloud platform. Note that we find that active VetConnect PLUS customers exhibit meaningfully higher loyalty for diagnostic recurring revenue. Our Company is executing well on all key dimensions and while 2016 was indeed an exceptional year for IDEXX what I'm most excited about is the opportunity that we have in front of us. People love their pets the world over and want to take good care of them. Diagnostics as an essential part of the care equation with the pet are way underutilized in practice and at IDEXX we are all about enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock. We see great potential to continue to expand our global markets. I want to conclude by saying how grateful I am for the hard work and accomplishments in 2016 of our over 7,000 employees worldwide who pursue this purpose. And so, Cynthia, with that, we'll open the call to questions. Unknown Speaker : Thank you. [Operating Instructions] and our first question will come from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Erin Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hey. Thanks for taking my questions, Jon, Brian. Can you speak a little bit to the competitive positioning of SediVue? How has the feedback been in the field so far and has there been any sort of surprises in terms of consumables utilization, just sort of what's incorporated in your 2017 guidance in terms of placement trends, the revenue contributions? Should we expect some sort of promotional activity around NAVC? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Well, thank you for the question. Yeah, we're very excited with SediVue which is a whole new category of urine diagnostics and \u2013 so obviously a very, very successful launch and momentum. We will be continuing that in 2017. We don't really see any change in the utilization per instrument. We continue to believe it will be around $3000 to $4500 per year in very, very profitable recurring revenue per instrument installation. As I mentioned, we'll be updating the algorithm, but that won't be the last update, this instrument will continually get better. I think what I would just step back to say is that, urine has a ton of diagnostic insight and historically while vets appreciated that, they were kind of hesitant to run urine because it was \u2013 there wasn't really a great way to do it. In-house it took a lot of tech time, 20 minutes, send it out to the reference lab, the urine changes. It's not as accurate. Everybody knows that. So it's kind of a between a rock and a hard place. And SediVue changes that. So long-term we really see urine as a growing diagnostic category. In practice that is significantly underutilized in relation to bloodwork, chemistry and hematology, which itself is underutilized in relation to what I'd say the current standards of care would suggest. So I just think there's a lot of momentum and of course our field sales force is going to be continuing with that in 2017. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And Erin, I'd just add that our outlook for 2017, we expect or targeting placements of 2,000 or more globally for SediVue. So obviously that's building on the strong momentum we had in the U.S. and we should be seeing additional benefits from our expansion internationally. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Right. We just really started the launch at the tail end of the quarter in the U.K. and Australia outside of North America and we'll be rolling it out over the rest of the major markets over the course of 2017 outside of North America. Erin Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Great. And I understand you don't want to comment on specific relationships like Banfield, NVA but I have to ask and broadly speaking how are your corporate relationships progressing? Are there any changes in your relationships, I guess, anticipated in 2017 particularly given the WOOF transaction and also are you placing SediVues into corporate accounts? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you for those questions. We have outstanding relationships with all of our corporate accounts and continue to grow our presence in corporate accounts and so I think that is reflected in our expectations for the year. We don't really see any fundamental change with the transaction that was announced earlier this year it's a very competitive market, it will continue to be a competitive market. We have an outstanding relationship with the entities that make up Mars in their veterinary business. And I would also just say that with regard to corporate accounts in general, what we see is actually the interest starts at the field \u2013 the interest starts in practices where they say, hey, this would really help our workflow and then corporate accounts we're always working at multiple levels. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. First one, just based on my math. It looks like the delta between your CAG recurring revenue growth and the industry growth you're tracking expanded quite a bit in the fourth quarter more than we normally would see. And I'm curious if there's anything in particular maybe it's a residual effect of the instrument placement starting to really come through but anything you would highlight that starting to try that delta between you and the industry data. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Well, I think we report global numbers of course right so we've got I think Jon highlighted that in international markets we had over 20% growth in consumable revenues and I think that's reflective of our efforts to expand the industry and the huge placement opportunities that we see \u2013 we've highlighted strategically. We think there is a 100,000 Catalyst placement opportunities globally and we've placed over 5,000 Catalyst incrementally this year. So we took steps towards that big opportunity but we see a lot of runway to continue and that's supporting the higher growth. In the US, we've seen accelerating gains through the year and that's a combination of the Catalyst gains and we're starting to see some of the benefits of SediVue blowing into the consumable growth rate and that will be something that will support us moving forward. So, basically really strong sales and marketing execution globally, the benefits of the expanding Catalyst platform, and our ongoing test innovation. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah I would just add obviously very strong customer loyalty that is added to adding new customers. But the other thing, Ryan is, we're growing the category of diagnostics through innovation. For example, the SediVue that we just talked about, that's a whole novel element that previously wasn't part of the category if you will in any meaningful way; a very small supply or something of no consequence. But we're also growing in places like fecal antigen, SDMA is, people are now more, have a stronger case to do preventative care when SDMA is a part of the chemistry panel because now they can actually find diseases, not just chronic kidney disease, but other diseases that have a secondary impact of injuring the kidney and thus SDMA coming up. And SDMA thus becomes a flag for something like a urinary tract infection, latent kidney stones or something like that. And of course that generates even more diagnostic revenue because you have reflex testing. So these are all kind of what we think are long-term secular trends that we are able to drive as a combination of bringing novel tests and innovation to the market and of course having a strong presence with our customers, so that we can educate and support them in the growing utilization. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, helpful color. And then Brian you highlighted this a bit but one follow-up on CapEx, I think, for 2016 came in quite a bit below your target, and you're looking for about 40% year-over-year growth next year, is that just timing and then if so anything in particular that caused that and that will drive the uptick next year? Thanks. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: It largely is timing. I think we basically had a pretty favorable year 2016 that was 3.7% of revenue... Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Down from 50% the year before. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I think longer term we've indicated we expect spending more in the 4% to 5% range and that's basically consistent with what we see in 2017. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open. Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, guys, good morning. I've got two. I'd say with that quarter, I am not going to, move on. I am not going to bug you about leverage. I will go in another direction and focus on international. Just, Jon, anything to slow down the international momentum, I guess what I'm grappling what is \u2013 you seem to have a lot of runway with Catalyst One, SDMA. SediVue is just first starting to gain traction. So maybe if you can just compare and contrast sort of the runway with innovation versus the various end markets, and if you are seeing or hearing about any pockets of strength or weakness in the different geographies? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. It's obviously people love their pets the world over and you mentioned some of the major innovations of that we're bringing. Interesting just on on SDMA, many markets, particularly \u2013 many markets in Europe interestingly are \u2013 they are more medically centric. And so SDMA is actually getting faster, if you will, pick up and sort of adoption and appreciation in those markets. Maybe it's because they're doing just sick animal testing, they don't do as much preventative care. For whatever reason the medical centricity is actually supporting the quicker appreciation for SDMA than we see in say the North American markets. You mentioned SediVue DX, I mean, we really haven't begun the launch of SediVue DX it's not reflected in the 2016 numbers and of course SediVue is a profitable category. Not only for the obviously the recurring revenues and we'll be running \u2013 we'll be rolling out the pay-per-view \u2013 pay-per-run model globally as we have in North America but the instrument placement is also higher profit than our typical instrument placement. And just as a reminder, we've made a series of investments including go-direct and strengthening our commercial organizations in markets such as Europe. In China we're very focused on the in-house market. In Brazil, people love their pets, in Brazil, and dress them very nicely but they don't have a full appreciation that veterinary care is also part of that an equation and so that's an attractive growth market. Even though the Brazil economy is nothing that you would crow about, our business in Brazil is doing really well. We've opened a reference lab in S\u00e3o Paulo and of course we're very focused on the in-house business and it's also an attractive market for the LPD business. And so it's interesting that we're seeing good growth in these markets that are in what I would call varied and not as, not always very exciting general economic areas. Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Okay, very helpful and then Brian I'll just ask you about sort of the unknown of tax reform, and just your thoughts at a high level of would IDEXX be a potential net beneficiary with some of the plans at least being thrown around or discussed in Washington and maybe just from a COGS perspective if you could just comment on your manufacturing around the world and sort of net imported versus exported. Thanks guys. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. I think that's the big theme that you just noted at the end of your question, Jon, which is we are very much an exporter. We have over 20% of products that we sell in international currencies in foreign markets. We either manufacture or source here in the U.S., we have a large manufacturing capability here in Maine, which we are very proud of and look to expand. And we do very limited actually production overseas that is sold into the US market. It's very selective. So I think it's hard to predict where tax reform will go, we're looking forward to that, but I think that the theme in a lot of the discussions are things that would help exporters and improve I think the climate for business. And, we're looking forward to more clarity on that front, but hopefully we'd be a net beneficiary if things go in that direction. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. Jon, just I just want to give a big shout out to our Westbrook-based manufacturing. We are very proud that the Catalyst was designed and manufactured here in Maine and the prior instrument, the VetTest, which is obviously about 30 years old \u2013 25 years old vintage. That was not actually manufactured in the U.S. So we moved the manufacturing of our chemistry analyzer from outside the U.S. to the U.S. with the transition to Catalyst. And so one of our many proud accomplishments here in Maine obviously, we're going to be \u2013 we manufactured the T4 slide here in Maine. We manufacture the \u2013 we'll be manufacturing the SDMA slide in our Georgia facility, it's where the electrolyte slides are manufactured, our core chemistry panels are manufactured for us in Rochester, New York. So, yeah that's one of the reasons why we're a very significant net exporter. Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. A lot of color. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Anne Edelstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, this is Anne Edelstein on for Derik, thanks for taking the question. A couple of broader market questions. First, did you provide a full-year same sales store gross estimate and just wondering if you think that given the expected uptick in U.S. discretionary spending, where you think that that growth can go in 2017, specifically if it can breach the long-standing high single digit growth bar? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you for that. We didn't provide a specific outlook for 2017. Obviously we reported the data comes from over 5,000 practices of all different kinds and all different softwares each quarter. So you can see that we're typically in the 6% revenue growth on a same-store sales basis. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: That's about what it was for the full year. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, for the full year 2016 \u2013 that's at the customer level not at our level. And so I think what's embedded in our outlook is really similar in 2017 kind of hard thing to forecast but we don't really see any reason to change. Our first quarter will \u2013 we did have the benefit. It was a very strong quarter last year. Brian mentioned leap year, but it was also a \u2013 that was a very favorable weather and since we haven't finished the fourth \u2013 first quarter this year from a weather point of view that's always a \u2013 that can effect practice visits if people can't get to the practice from a weather point of view though. And, so that's a favorable compare that we have to \u2013 but we \u2013 people love their pets and one of the things we've said and observed is that while baby boomers were real big driver of the growth in pet care, they seem to have passed on to millennials an even stronger love for their pets and millennials keep \u2013 prioritize even higher than baby boomers their pets and making trade-offs to take care of their pets. Anne Edelstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks for the commentary. And then another question on your livestock business, I understand that's a small revenue base but the lower herd screening revenue, is that something seasonal or are you seeing a fundamental change in that business? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Well, that's a number, the herd health screening, is a number that can move up and down. I wouldn't call it seasonal. I'd just say it's the propensity of exports from one country to another to ebb and flow. And so it's a pretty small number but it does create a little bit of year to year volatility in the LPD growth rate. Anne Edelstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Fair enough. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next will come from the line of Nick Jansen with Raymond James. Your line is open. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Congrats on a strong finish to the year. Two questions; first on the margin expansion that you saw in the fourth quarter and pretty much all year. I think you've kind of talked about every quarter, if I go back to the transcripts, that you kind of delayed some expenses or expenses were a little bit lower than what you were thinking and I am just trying to get a better sense of why can't the significant constant currency margin improvement you saw in 2016 not be delivered similarly in 2017, particularly if consumables and recurring revenue is \u2013 should be accelerating amidst the premium placement launches that we saw or placement that we saw in 2016. Thanks. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. We are planning for continued operating margin expansion and operating expense leverage in 2017. So that's factored into our outlook. It's at the midpoint of our longer-term goal. And, so I think we are intending to build and we did flow through the strong operating performance in 2016. So we're building on top of the progress that we made this year. I think in terms of this year we \u2013 I'm sorry last year, 2016 \u2013 we clearly had very good revenue growth at the higher end of our goals. We were full three points above our original growth goals for the year. So I think we entered the year with a series of investment plans based on a level of growth that we significantly exceeded and that helps us to deliver relatively more operating expense leverage and we're clearly getting a great return from the sales and marketing investments that we made. In fact that was the biggest area of leverage that we took advantage of this year, this past year. So we always have variations in terms of like when we actually execute hires and things like that that may change quarter to quarter, but I think the longer-term theme here is, we believe we can grow at very healthy rates and continue to get leverage out of our model while we're investing towards the significant long-term growth potential we see in the business. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. Just to add with what Brian said, we've seen high ROI on incremental absolute OpEx and \u2013 so we're going to continue to double down and grow in our \u2013 that because that helps drive organic growth of very profitable revenues which then translates into areas of gross margin and allows us to achieve some operating expense leverage. So, that's one of the benefits of enduring growth model that we can both simultaneously make investments and achieve both gross margin and operating expense leverage. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks for that and then secondly on SDMA, largely today it's free for most customers who are your existing kind of reference lab users adding to the kind of normal chemistry panel. And then you said today that you're adding it to Catalyst by the end of 4Q and two-thirds of your Catalyst customers already use T4 and you're going to be giving it away for free within the T4 as well with no incremental cost. So I'm just trying to better understand how we go from the revenue today of SDMA to the $200 million that we're hoping for by 2021 in context of a lot of this being added without incremental revenues. So, just maybe better understand maybe the price levers that you're pulling to drive that figure. Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you for highlighting that and it's an area that's really exciting for us. Of course, what SDMA does is it grows the entire diagnostic modality. We get higher customer retention than we otherwise would have. It allows us to attract new customers to the reference lab modality. It allows us to achieve maybe modestly higher price realization and utilization. What we're doing is we're estimating what the incremental impact is on SDMA in all those categories and none of that is direct, if you will, revenue from SDMA itself, because just to rephrase what you said, we're adding it at no incremental charge if they bought a chemistry panel from IDEXX in the reference lab. And we are adding it at no incremental charge on in-house if they're already buying the T4 slide. And, what we see though is that we'll probably have greater T4 SDMA utilization per customer than we would have had T4 standalone. And, of course if they are just wanting to add SDMA to the panel and not T4 we would suggest they should want to run T4 because actually our big data just recently showed that one in seven dogs, regardless of age, across the entire age cohort, has a low T4 rating which would suggest a thyroid or other disease that needs to be further investigated. I mean that's healthy dogs. That's not sick dogs. That's healthy dogs. Can you imagine, if you had a disease, you would have a one in seven chance of getting it, that you might want to get tested for that. And it's one in 10 cats. So we would recommend that they run the \u2013 that's kind of the case for T4, but then we've got a great case for SDMA, so why don't you just run the two together and add it to your profile. But if they ran SDMA without T4 then of course that is going to be incremental revenue on top of all those other sources which will support the modality growth in the modality revenues of instrument consumables and then give more customers exposure to the value of SDMA. What we find is when SDMA has, provides clear information they would not have otherwise gotten, they act on it and they see different patient outcomes they realize how important it is to have SDMA as part of the core chemistry panel. And so we're adding a whole new class of customers who wouldn't have had that experience once we launch SDMA on a slide. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Super helpful. Thanks, Jon. Congrats. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, guys, great quarter and thanks for taking my questions. The first one is on SediVue and would love to just get a little bit more clarity around \u2013 you launched it, I believe, April of last year. Now that you have three quarters in the books can you speak to customer level feedback and then can you also speak to the number of tests per day per box that maybe some people initially were running and are running now? Has there been any lift and can you speak to utilization of SediVue and the early install base? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yes. Well, thank you. It's roughly, they're roughly running one a day. And that's what gets us plus or minus and that's what gets us to the $3,000 to $4,500 per year in recurring revenue on a SediVue placement. That is way underutilized but that is what we've seen in the first nine months. Still obviously very, very early days. I think as customers continue to appreciate the value of urinalysis, we would hope for that to grow but that's going to be a long-term trend. That's not going to be a short-term trend as all trends on growing utilization in diagnostics are in veterinary medicine. But I think customers are very excited about adding urine to the category and we're only at 1,500 out of 25,000 plus customers in the U.S. so we've got a lot of runway. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Excellent. And it's really hard to poke holes in your quarter and especially given the fact that you posted your strongest quarter in the U.S. in Q4 relative to any other and you did it in a period where the same-store Cornerstone volumes increased 1.4%. It's a little bit lighter than we've seen earlier in the year and Jon, you called out Q1 was certainly helped by weather. But as we think about 2017 same-store volumes do you think you can get back to that maybe 2% same-store volume level and just maybe speak to the drivers around some of the moving parts? Thank you. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. Just one quick correction. So that 5,200 practice is not just Cornerstone. It's \u2013 we get data from all different practice, four, five different practice, it's very representative to the market. And so I think it's pretty good data; 5,200 observations of real data is pretty good data. Look you know the Q4 \u2013 the revenue growth in the practice is what, 5.8%. So that was a \u2013 that trend data can bounce around; you look for the average of the year was higher than that. I don't think there's anything in particular that would suggest that that is the start of some kind of trend. And we are providing on our website that historical information in graphical form so I might point you and investors to that. Thank you and thank you for your kind comments. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Thank you. Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our final questions will come from the line of David Westenberg from CL King. Your line is open. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys thanks for taking my question. So I will keep it short, since it's already been an hour, so \u2013 you highlighted the strong consumables versus instruments on a go forward basis, but you didn't necessarily highlight that in the margins. Is that already reflected in the guidance update for this quarter or is there a possible upside to some of the margins with that? And then, there's kind of a second part to that, and that is, if there is some upside in that and you have any maybe updates or puts and takes that could change the outlook from that 50 to 100 basis point long-term margin expansion, operating margin expansion goal? Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: We're comfortable with that outlook. I think the growth in our recurring revenue base is a positive dynamic on margins and if we continue to grow at strong rates that's helpful as well both on gross margins and operating expense. We do intend to continue to invest towards the long-term growth opportunity. Jon highlighted some aspects of that today in the call in talking about the sales and marketing investments we want to continue to make globally which are yielding very high returns. So we're comfortable with delivering on that balance and it reflects if you look at our EPS outlook for 2017, normalized for foreign exchange and for the accounting guidance change, it's right in-line with the 15% to 20% that we said we were targeting delivering and we look forward to having another great year in line with our long-term goals. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Perfect and I am looking forward to seeing you guys at NAVC. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. Great. Same here. Appreciate the questions. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And I think with that we are going to conclude the call. We appreciate everybody calling in. I also just want to reiterate my huge thanks to the 7,000 plus IDEXXers around the world who come in every day to pursue our purpose of enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock. And it's just gratifying to see and to be able to report and to be able to represent the outcome of their efforts with investors as we wrap up 2016 and move into 2017. And, we're definitely looking forward to an exciting new year in 2017. And with that, we'll conclude the call. Operator : Thank you, and ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",

We appreciate you may have additional questions, please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we'll take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you and good morning everyone. IDEXX's strong business momentum continued in Q1, driving excellent financial results. In terms of highlights, Q1 revenues were $462 million, reflecting organic growth of 11%, at the high-end of our expectations, supported by very strong 14% organic gains in CAG recurring diagnostic revenues. CAG recurring revenue gains reflected strong global growth across major modalities, including 15% consumable growth, 13% lab gains and 11% organic growth in rapid assay. We also delivered another strong quarter in terms of expanding our instrument base, with 2,340 premium analyzers placed globally, up 18% from prior year levels. Strong top line growth, better than expected operating margin performance, and $0.12 per share in benefit from the adoption of new accounting guidance related to tax benefits from share-based compensation, supported Q1 EPS of $0.77 per share or an increase of 53% on a constant dollar basis. Further adjusting for the impact of the new share-based compensation accounting guidance, comparable constant currency EPS growth was 29%. Reflecting our continued strong business trends, we're raising our full-year organic growth guidance by 0.5%, to 9.5% to 11%. Along with updated estimates for foreign exchange rates, which improved since our last call, this results in a reported revenue range of $1.925 billion to $1.950 billion for 2017, an increase of $15 million compared to our original guidance. We're increasing our EPS range by $0.10, to $2.95 to $3.11 per share, reflecting higher estimates for 2017 benefits associated with adoption of accounting guidance related to tax benefits from share-based compensation. Operating profit upside from our higher revenue outlook will be offset by incremental planned investments in our U.S. commercial capability, U.S. lab capacity and R&D, aligned with the significant opportunity we see to build on strong CAG growth trends and continue to deliver against our long-term goals for 10% plus overall annual organic revenue growth. We'll manage these investments while delivering a targeted 75 to 100 basis point improvement in constant currency operating margins, at the higher end of our long-term goals. These operating profit benefits will be offset by a $0.05 per share headwind related to expectations for relatively higher average effective tax rate, excluding share compensation accounting impacts, driven by strong profit growth in the U.S. We'll review our updated 2017 outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our Q1 performance by segment and region. We achieved continued strong organic growth in both U.S. and international regions in the first quarter, driven by our CAG business. U.S. revenues were $289 million in the quarter, up 11% organically. Gains reflected continued strong premium instrument placements and 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. U.S. recurring revenue gains were supported by strong double-digit growth in consumables and reference labs, as well as a very solid quarter for rapid assay sales, driven by our growing 4Dx franchise. U.S. recurring gains continue to be primarily volume driven, supported by ongoing improvement in customer retention trends across modalities. We also achieved a relatively stronger 3% level of average net price improvement in Q1 benefiting from timing and year-on-year comparisons of promotional programs. For the full year 2017, we're maintaining an outlook for solid average CAG Diagnostics recurring pricing gains in the 2% to 3% range in the U.S., augmenting strong volume trends. IDEXX's performance continued to significantly outpace solid U.S. veterinary practice market growth in Q1, reflected in our data set from about 5,000 clinics. In Q1 on a same store basis, patient visits increased 0.7% and clinic revenues increased 4.6% compared to very strong prior year Q1 clinic revenue gains of 9% or a two year average of 6.8%, very much in line with recent trends. International revenues in Q1 were $173 million, up 11% organically. International results were driven by 17% organic gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues reflecting continued very strong consumable revenue gains supported by our expanding Catalyst instrument base and significant gains in average testing utilization. We also continued to see solid double-digit organic lab revenue gains in our international markets supported by very positive customer response to SDMA, as well as double-digit growth in rapid assay sales. Overall international revenue gains were moderated by year-on-year declines in our international LPD business, impacted by lower levels of herd health screening for Asia cattle exports. Turning to segment performance, our Q1 results were supported by strong global gains across CAG Diagnostics testing modalities and continued momentum in expanding our premium instrument base. Global instrument revenues for IDEXX were $26 million, up 17% organically, supported by 18% growth in premium Instrument placements. Strong year-on-year instrument revenue growth was driven by SediVue, including benefits from our SediVue international launch in select markets. Globally, we placed 1,131 Catalysts, 822 premium hematology analyzers, and 387 SediVues in the first quarter. Global Catalyst placements were in line with very strong prior year Q1 levels supported by ongoing international momentum and high levels of competitive Catalyst placements in North America. Placement momentum supported continued global expansion of our Catalyst base which is driving accelerated consumable growth. Globally, our installed Catalyst instrument base increased 22% year-on-year in Q1 reflecting 11% year-on-year growth in the U.S. and 36% year-on-year gains in international markets. In North America, we placed 388 Catalysts in Q1 with 304 or 78%, at competitive or greenfield accounts. Overall North America Catalyst placements in the prior year first quarter included 131 second Catalyst placements as part of our successful customer retention program compared to 59 second Catalyst placements in Q1 of 2017. Adjusting for second Catalysts, year-on-year Catalyst placements grew solidly in North America, supported by 18% gains in competitive placements. Consistent with our economic value focus and our sales compensation approach, we also saw excellent results in the placement of SediVue and SNAP Pros in North America. Strong customer response to our new ProRead capability supported the placement of 1,041 SNAP Pros in North America in Q1, our strongest quarterly performance since the SNAP Pro launch in 2014. The combined impact of accelerating customer penetration and the beneficial network effect of integration across our offerings sets the stage for continued strong recurring revenue growth and very high customer retention. Benefits from IDEXX innovation and enhanced commercial capability continue to drive very strong recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth. In Q1, global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues were $347 million, up 14% organically. Reference laboratory and consulting services, with revenues of $159 million, grew 13% organically in the first quarter supported by double-digit organic gains in both U.S. and international markets compared to very strong 15% organic growth in Q1 of 2016. Please note that our organic growth metrics do not include adjustments for the number of equivalent days in the quarter. Instrument consumable revenues of $124 million in Q1 grew 15% organically supported by continued 20% organic gains in international markets and strong double-digit growth in the U.S. including building benefits from the expansion of SediVue. Overall, SediVue contributed 1.6% to global consumable gains in the quarter. Rapid assay revenues increased 11% organically in Q1 to $48 million supported by continued solid volume gains in SNAP 4Dx Plus, strong growth in specialty rapid assays, stabilized volume trend in first generation products as well as solid net price improvement, including favorable year-on-year comparisons in Q1 related to U.S. promotional programs which supported both higher price and volume realization in Q1. We're targeting mid-single digit organic growth in rapid assay revenues for the balance of 2017. Please note that these results do not include revenues from SNAP Pro placements which are captured in instrument revenues. Veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging system revenues were $30 million in the quarter, up 4% organically. Solid VSS gains were driven by continued penetration of recurring services in our Cornerstone installed base, moderated by lower instrument placement revenue as we transition to a recurring cloud-based service model. Diagnostic imaging system revenues also increased solidly supported by growth in digital radiography placements and recurring services, including growth in our Web PACS platform. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenues of $29 million declined 5% organically in Q1. Results were pressured by lower levels of herd health screening of Australian and New Zealand dairy cattle for export to China. This is a relatively small business for us, which can be subject to more volatility based on local market conditions. Excluding herd health screening impacts, LPD revenues were flat year-on-year in Q1, as solid gains in recurring core products and double-digit gains in pregnancy testing were offset by pressure on our dairy business, in part related to lower milk pricing globally. As noted on our Q4 call, for 2017, we're targeting flat to modest growth in LPD overall, as we continue to work through pressures from year-on-year comparisons for select product lines. Our water business revenues grew 7% organically in Q1 to $25 million, up against a strong 11% growth comparison in Q1 of 2016. Performance was supported by continued progress in developing our core U.S. and European markets and strong growth in Asia Pacific. We continue to be on-track to sustain high-single-digit organic growth in this highly profitable business. Turning to the P&L, operating profit in Q1 was $92 million, up 25% as reported or 28% on a constant currency basis, with the results driven by strong profit gains in our CAG business. Operating margins were 20%, up 260 basis points on a constant currency basis, reflecting solid gross margin improvement and significant operating expense leverage. Excellent Q1 performance puts us on track to deliver constant currency operating margin improvement this year at the higher end of our long-term goal of 50 to 100-basis point annual gains, while we advance investments to sustain our strong organic revenue growth trajectory. Gross profit was $258 million in Q1, up 13% on a reported basis. Adjusted for foreign exchange impacts, gross margins increased 150 basis points, reflecting solid CAG net price gains and volume leverage from strong consumable and reference lab growth. Foreign exchange hedge gains, which benefit gross profit, were about $1 million in Q1. Operating expenses in Q1 were up 8%, driven primarily by investments in sales and marketing resources and enabling information technology capability. Q1 expense growth was lower than projected, reflecting timing of select head count additions. We expect higher levels of operating expense growth for the balance of the year as we advance incremental investments in U.S. commercial capability and towards R&D initiatives which we'll discuss as part of our updated 2017 financial outlook. EPS in Q1 was $0.77 per share, including $0.12 per share in benefit from adoption of new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation. Tax benefits from share-based compensation were high in Q1 reflecting a combination of factors, including the significant recent appreciation of our stock price, Q1 vesting of stock option and restricted stock grants, and higher levels of activity in 2017 relating to the expiration of specific stock compensation grants. For the full-year, we now expect benefits from the adoption of the new accounting guidance in the range of $0.22 to $0.26 per share or $0.10 per share higher than our original estimates. Please note that we do not estimate that this higher level of activity will flow through to future periods as we believe that a range of $0.12 to $0.16 per share of annual benefit reflects a reasonable estimate for 2018 and beyond based on our current visibility and analysis, assuming current stock price levels. Aside from the benefits from the new accounting adoption, Q1 EPS results were supported by continued benefits from share repurchases, which lowered year-on-year shares outstanding by 0.9%, net of a 0.5% negative impact, related to the adoption of the new share-based compensation accounting guidance. Our effective tax rate was 18.5% in Q1, including 13.2% of tax rate benefit from share-based compensation accounting adoption. Foreign exchange net of hedge impacts in Q1 2016 and 2017 lowered operating profit by $2 million and EPS by $0.01 per share in the quarter. Free cash flow was $8 million for 2017 in Q1, reflecting normal quarterly seasonality. We continue to maintain a full year outlook for free cash flow of about 95% of net income, aligned with projected full year capital spending of $90 million. Our outlook for continued strong free cash flow generation aligned with our very strong business momentum, supports allocation of capital to share repurchases. In Q1 we repurchased 400,000 shares in the open market at an average price of $130 per share, or a deployment of $51 million in cash flow. We ended Q1 with $1.268 billion in debt outstanding, $400 million in cash and investment balances and $178 million in borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 2.7 times gross and 1.8 times net of cash and investment balances. We anticipate maintaining gross leverage ratios in the 2.5 times to 3.0 times range in 2017, with continued deployment of excess cash flow toward share repurchases. Turning to our 2017 outlook, as noted, we're increasing our full-year revenue and EPS guidance range. We are raising our reported revenue guidance by $15 million to $1.925 billion to $1.950 billion, reflecting a higher expectation for organic revenue growth of 9.5% to 11% as well as about $5 million of revenue benefits from relatively more favorable FX rate changes. At the updated FX rates noted in our press release, we're now projecting that our reported revenue growth will be reduced by about 1% in 2017 related to year-on-year strengthening of the U.S. dollar. FX changes are projected to reduce 2017 operating profit by about $6 million and EPS by $0.05 a share at the assumed rates net of a projected $6 million or $0.05 per share benefit from previously established hedge positions. In terms of our operating margin outlook, we're projecting annual improvement on a reported basis of 60 to 85 basis points, which equates to 75 to 100 annual basis point improvement on a constant currency basis. This constant currency outlook is relatively higher than our original guidance and it's at the high end of our long-term annual operating margin improvement goals. We'll be delivering this strong performance while advancing about $10 million in incremental investment related to expanding our regional customer-facing capability in the U.S., adding capacity to support continued strong U.S. laboratory services growth and advancing our R&D agenda. Jon will talk more about these initiatives in his comments. We see these as very high-return investments aligned with the very strong organic growth potential that we see for our business. As noted, we're raising our 2017 EPS outlook to $2.95 to $3.11 per share, an increase of $0.10 per share, to reflect benefits from updated estimates for the adoption of the new accounting guidance. While we're expecting $0.03 per share in EPS upsides from flow-through of stronger organic growth expectations, while covering planned incremental investments and $0.02 per share in benefits for an improved FX outlook, these upsides will be offset by the $0.05 per share negative impact related to increase in our underlying effective tax rate. Regarding the adoption of the new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation, on our Q4 call, we had estimated that our effective tax rate for 2017 would be about 30.5% to 31% prior to these impacts, similar to prior year levels. Given very strong profit growth trends in the U.S., which carry a higher effective tax rate, we are now increasing this estimate for 2017 to 32.0%. In terms of benefits from reflecting the tax deductibility of share-based compensation in our P&L under the new accounting guidance, we are raising our expected tax rate benefits on this front in 2017 by 2%, to 5.5% to 6.5%. This results in an updated estimate for 2017 full year effective tax rate of 25.5% to 26.5%. As noted, a portion of this tax rate benefit in 2017 is related to specific factors, including the timing of the exercise of options, which are not expected to carry over into future periods. At this stage, we believe an estimate for an effective tax rate of 27.5% to 28.5% is reasonable for years post 2017, based on our analysis of future vesting schedules and historical activity. This assumes no change in U.S. corporate tax policy. We'll provide updated estimates on this front later in the year as we share our preliminary guidance for 2018. Our outlook for share count in 2017 is for a reduction in average shares outstanding from continued stock repurchases of 1% to 1.5%, net of a 0.5% accounting impact. As noted, we expect to maintain our gross leverage ratios at 2.5 to 3 times adjusted EBITDA in 2017, resulting in net interest expense of $32 million to $33 million. In terms of our second quarter outlook in 2017, we expect Q2 revenue \u2013 reported revenue growth in the 7% to 8% range reflecting organic gains of 9% to 10%, offset by about 2% of FX headwind. Keep in mind that we'll be facing some tougher growth comparisons related to the U.S. SediVue instrument launch which will moderate reported instrument revenue gains as well as favorable Easter timing last year. Year-on-year operating margin improvement in Q2 is expected to be flat on a reported basis as we ramp the incremental U.S. commercial investment including impacts from some upfront costs. And looking ahead to Q3 and Q4, please also keep in mind that we will have about 1% of revenue headwind due to year-on-year comparisons in the number of equipment business days. This impact is factored into our updated full-year guidance. That concludes the financial review. Let me now turn the call over to Jon for his comments. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you, Brian. We are indeed off to a great start to the year. I note the 14% constant currency growth of our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues in Q1 which make up 72% of IDEXXs total revenues and is the core driver of not just revenue but profitability to IDEXX. This growth metric exceeded the 13% we achieved in Q4 2016, which itself was the highest growth quarter of 2016 and we had a strong compare in Q1 of 2016 in the U.S. if investors recall. We had strength in all global geographies and double-digit growth in all three modalities that contribute to these diagnostic recurring revenues; that is reference labs, instrument consumables, and rapid assay tests. So, a solid start to the year with good momentum, giving us confidence to increase IDEXX's 2017 organic growth guidance by 0.5%, to 9.5% to 11%. Let me turn to a few operational highlights in the quarter. Our international teams around the world continue to make huge progress placing our franchise Catalyst One chemistry analyzer in all geographies, generating 20% international VetLab consumable growth. This novel chemistry analyzer is high function and low cost. We believe there exists a long runway for instrument placements internationally. At the end of Q1, our active installed base of Catalysts outside North America has grown cumulatively to over 11,000 instruments and customers. And yet, we believe the potential number of additional customers is roughly five times that amount. And the number of companion animal practices is growing every year, so, many years of growth ahead for us. In addition, we are seeing very nice double-digit growth in our reference labs in our core markets of Europe, Australia and Japan. In many international markets, SDMA adoption and appreciation has been even quicker than the North American markets. While this is driving reference lab growth, it also bodes well for when we launch SDMA on the Catalyst analyzer in the form of a slide, currently targeted for the end of this year. Our Companion Animal Group North American sales organization also had a great quarter. During the quarter, our North American team moved to a new compensation approach to reward for instrument placements where we give our sales professionals credit for the economic value of a placement to IDEXX over a multi-year timeframe, which recognizes not only the value of the instrument placement but the recurring revenues that comes from each type of placement and the profitability of those revenues. I am very pleased that our teams made a nice transition to the new approach. And we saw a 14% jump in field productivity and instrument placement value in Q1 when viewed on an apples-to-apples basis, i.e., based on the economic value of instruments placed in Q1 2017 versus the implied economic value in Q1 of 2016 and adjusting appropriately for SediVue, where last year, we generated orders in Q1 but did not start placements until Q2. It's great to see this productivity jump as it was the driver of 18% growth in competitive Catalyst placements and very strong placement level for over 1,000 SNAP Pro devices. SNAP Pro placements also benefited from the new software functionality in Q1 that automatically interprets the SNAP. Customers that are actively using their SNAP Pros for their SNAP devices are very loyal to our family of rapid assay tests and these placements are growing that cohort of loyal customers. While our U.S. commercial teams in the field and those supporting them did a great job with instrument placements, they also continue to drive strong double-digit growth in reference labs growing the market and convincing new accounts to join the IDEXX SDMA revolution. Indeed, our fully direct presence in the U.S. has been so successful that we've made a decision to further augment our field presence. We are expanding our field commercial organization in the second quarter, adding three new regions and a total of over 45 new field-based professionals, growing our field presence by 12% from roughly 390 professionals to over 435. We're also growing our reference lab capacity to better serve our customers as well as slightly augmenting our R&D investments. Collectively, this $10 million additional investment in 2017 is something we can do and still expand our constant currency operating margins above prior guidance, courtesy of strong accelerated revenue growth. We know the investments in customer presence, customer experience and innovation in the core U.S. companion animal market has a high ROI. Our recent investments have a clear and proven track record of return in the form of profitable augmented growth in recurring diagnostic revenue. On the technology front, we've now completed our rollout of the more advanced SediVue algorithmic interpretation software to our installed base of customers, courtesy of the fact they're all connected via SmartService and we've gotten tremendous customer feedback. The software update that we call Neural Network 2.0 takes a machine learning approach that incorporates over 14 million images that our customers have generated and sent to us via SmartService over the nine months in 2016 that the product had been in the field. Neural Network 2.0 makes great strides in the instrument's capability but were never done. We continually upgrade our instruments with new software, new capability and occasionally new menu. And SediVue is no exception. There will be even more to come. The reception of SediVue, now with Neural Network 2.0 gives us confidence in our target of over 2,000 SediVue placements globally in 2017. As I mentioned, we remain on track to launch SDMA on a Catalyst slide by the end of the year which will be huge. And our new SNAP fecal test in mid-2018, which we view as another long-term blockbuster. No question that our pipeline of novel diagnostic tests, systems and software remains robust. Our strategy is about enduring, profitable growth. People love their pets the world over and want to take care of them. And yet, veterinary services are vastly underutilized, including the all-important diagnostics category, which after all is essential to determining a pet's health status, since pets can't tell you what's wrong. Our strategy is to work hard to fill the gap between current practice and this potential. This is going to take a long time, years if not decades. The trends are both huge, somewhat tectonic in pace and long-term in nature, driving both long-term secular growth well above the growth of the general economy and profitability for IDEXX. IDEXX is at the tip of the spear in driving this growth with our technology and software solutions and the great teams in markets around the world. I want to conclude the up-front comments with just a huge thanks to our IDEXX employees across the company and around the world who delivered such a great quarter, and to our customers for their continued confidence in partnering with IDEXX to support their clients with the important bonds we all have with our pets. So, at this point, we'll open it up to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Jon, one for you. Given the significant OUS opportunities, specifically with instruments that you discussed, can you talk a little bit more about the balance between investing more of the upside into the U.S. customer-facing organization and spending those dollars outside of the U.S.? And then, number two, I'm just curious if any of this is due to competitive actions in the U.S. market, or if it's more just the expected return on investment versus any externalities you're seeing? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. It's a wonderful situation, Ryan, because we really see attractive markets, of course, in the U.S. which is, by the way, two-thirds of global market today, as silly as that seems, for Companion Animal Diagnostics, and great opportunities really around the world. As you know, in international geographies, over the last several years, we have moved to more and more of a fully direct presence in many countries and roughly 70% of our Companion Animal revenues outside the U.S. are now sold through direct organizations and 30% through hybrid or distribution. We think at this point we're about at the right mix, but those have been some very significant investments. And now we're seeing the return on those investments. And they're led by \u2013 outside the U.S. They are led by just the exceptional opportunity we have for Catalyst placements and they're \u2013 it's a high growth, and I think we feel comfortable with the growth and investments we're making there. In the U.S. market, we're just seeing a tremendous response to our innovation portfolio. The U.S. market is a more sophisticated market. But it's shocking, Ryan. We estimate that only 7% of clinical visits, a chemistry panel, just a chemistry panel is run. Only 7%, and yet best practice, evidence-based medicine would suggest that preventive care, including routine wellness testing is really appropriate given we find things. So, that 7% is just a small fraction of where we think it could be. And the responses we're seeing to things like SDMA or SediVue, or now the incredible response to the SNAP Pro, which is primarily a U.S. market because, of course, it leverages the rapid assay behind, means that the constraint here is more customer presence. And so, based on the momentum we have in the U.S., we think that augmenting our investments here is going to help us support our 10%-plus organic growth of the company as a whole into future years. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Ryan, I'd just reinforce too. This is an investment that's based on an opportunity and a return from the opportunity. It's not a reaction to other dynamics. As you know, this is our core business. We know it well. And this is what we love to invest in, and when we see the opportunity for incremental growth and incremental return, we very much would like to invest towards that for \u2013 on an ongoing basis. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. It's just \u2013 kind of building on that comment, Ryan. We're not a company that makes a lot of acquisitions. I mean, we make acquisitions when they fit into our core strategy. We're very interested in it, but there's just not that many to do. So, our types of investments we're making are \u2013 they're more organic, but we think that has the best ROI. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then one more follow-up. Could you talk a little bit more about instrument placements into competitive accounts you've made over the last one to two years. I know some of your competitors have talked about those opportunities reopening for them. So, I'm curious if you have data on retention for some of the accounts that you have displaced over the last year or two? Thank you. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. We measure the retention trends for our instrument customer base as a whole. And we've seen an improving trend in those retention levels for the consumables that come from our instrument customers and we're around \u2013 and that's improving every quarter, at low rates at this point. But we're at 98% retention. So, that's \u2013 and this quarter is a little better than last and last quarter is a little better than the quarter before. And so, we're pleased with that and... Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. I'd expand beyond that to say it's not just instruments, it's across modalities. We're seeing improving retention trends in the U.S. in reference lab, consumables, rapid assay. And it's one of the things that's helping our underlying growth. It's also helping improve our underlying net price realization. It's a very positive trend and goes back to some of the comments we were making about the network effect that, as we're bringing together different instrument solutions through integrated systems architecture and have invested well above $100 million plus ahead of the industry on these types of initiatives over time, we're seeing the benefits of that. And, I think, that aids retention and will continue to aid retention going forward. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. The other thing, Ryan, we're seeing is we've shared this metric from time to time, the percentage of our customers that we believe are loyal customers or significant customers for both our in-house and reference lab. And, I think, several years ago, we said that was in the high-30%s, 36% to 38%, depending on what year you picked. We're now at 47% of our customers who are loyal in one or the other or both of the in-house instrument and reference lab, are loyal in both. It's an interesting number because it has grown, but it's still below 50%, which just shows how much runway we have ahead to continue to build a complete diagnostic experience with our customers. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Well, thank you for that. That's helpful color. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse : Great. Thanks so much. You mentioned some underlying or better underlying margin improvement in your updated guidance net of the incremental investments that you're making. And is that just a function of the improved organic growth profile or is there other initiatives going on? And as we think about the longer term drivers of profit improvement, where do you see some of the more meaningful opportunities near-term? Thanks. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. Erin, in simple terms, I think we had obviously a great start to the year in the first quarter. And looking ahead, we do see some incremental benefit from the stronger organic growth profile that we've highlighted, which is offset by the $10 million of incremental investment that we're advancing. And the net of that is it's a bit better than where we were in our original guidance, and it's at the high-end of our long-term goals. I think our long-term goals are consistent with where we've been, which is we see the opportunity to sustain 50 to 100 basis points of annual margin improvement. We think the gross margin will be a key driver of that, aided by strong growth in recurring revenues, CAG Diagnostics revenues, as well as productivity in areas like our lab business, ongoing improvement there. And we think that we can also get operating expense leverage as we continue to invest against the long-term potential of this highly profitable and durable annuity that is at the core of our economic model. So, a similar long-term outlook and we're tracking really well this year as we position ourselves for that 10% plus organic revenue growth goal that we're hoping to continue to achieve. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And Erin, from a modality point of view, obviously, we've got volume leverage and productivity initiatives in our core reference lab networks around the world, the benefit from the double-digit growth we're seeing in the lab business. And on the VetLab side, obviously, the growth in the \u2013 that's a good business and the growth in the recurring revenues of VetLab consumables, both of those augmented by a couple percent price realization and effective management of costs are two of the big \u2013 I think between the two of those, it's easily over 60% of IDEXX's total revenues. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse : Excellent. Thanks. And you mentioned the 45 new reps, I think, you said and some new regions as well. What regions are you adding and how quickly should these reps fully ramp up based on the experience you've seen so far? And just that hybrid versus direct model in your other countries, are you expanding the direct effort elsewhere as well? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. We go through a systematic process of looking at our account coverage around the country. And it's a pretty complicated process because you have to kind of redraw the lines. So, we see where we see the highest ROI. And some of that is in having fewer accounts per rep, so that reps can call on those accounts because that's what grows the revenues. And some of it is covering some of what we call the white space which is the \u2013 I don't know, roughly 5% or 6% of the country that we don't have direct account coverage because it's highly rural. We cover by phone, but now we're adding some account coverage. So, this is really the highest ROI places to make those investments. Those 45 reps are, of course, both sales and our field support organization, both of which are highly appreciated by the customers and help drive growth. It generally takes a quarter for them to get trained and get into those territories. I think they start generating a return after that quarter. So, we're really timing this so we're going to be in great shape for the fourth quarter of 2017, always an important instrument placement quarter. But they grow in productivity over time. You can just see what's happened, we did the expansion in the beginning of 2015, and we're still seeing productivity growth from that expansion in the first quarter of 2017. So, it's a \u2013 you get growth in productivity of those reps. With regard to your comments of international, we think we're about \u2013 right now in terms of the 70% direct and 30%, now 30%, many of those, we do have a strong in-country presence, but we also work with distribution. Sometimes they provide logistics or collections or sometimes there's a full presence. And supporting our distributors is \u2013 these are generally more emerging markets and \u2013 or places where it's just not \u2013 doesn't make sense to have a direct presence. So, I think we're going to, obviously, be continuing to grow appropriately our feet on the street internationally consistent with the revenue growth. But I don't see \u2013 I think we've made the shifts we want to make in fully direct now for all intents and purposes. I think we have the right mix right now. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse : Great. Thanks. Appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good morning. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Good morning. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Good morning. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, I actually wanted to piggyback on Erin's question on the gross margin. I mean, certainly 150 basis points improvement, much better than we had thought in the quarter. Just kind of talk about pacings of the gross margin for the rest of the year and I guess full year expectations for where you think it'll end up? Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. I think we are targeting continued gross margin improvement. I think that the investments that we're talking about will be relatively more in the OpEx line in terms of how they're going to flow through the year. So, I mentioned Q2, the net of that will be relatively flat and that is we will have some ramp in the OpEx and some of the lab capacity investments are impacting gross margin, but those, of course, will pay off for us, it's basically they will ramp. But I think you should expect a profile moving forward in the near term that is margin gains driven by on the gross margin line and where we're reinvesting that in OpEx just given the growth opportunity we see. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I guess, still, staying on \u2013 I guess, if you look at sort of the out year expectations on the business. I know you've guided to 50 to 100 basis points for the longer term model. Is there an opportunity to sort of have a bigger step change than that on a recurring basis? I mean can that go 50 basis points higher over time? Is that \u2013 would you need to see a better mix shift in that or just see more adoption of product? I'm just simply saying like is there an opportunity on the margin to see it sustainably go up another 50 or so basis points on an annual basis? Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I think we will continue to drive gross margin improvement. That is a key part of our goals, and I think if we're successful growing the way we think we can on the recurring CAG side. That will aid that dynamic. I think we always have the choice to govern the pace of the investment that we're investing back in the business. And just building on Jon's earlier comments, I think we want to build this annuity as large as we can make it, and so I think we try to calibrate that expectation to invest in things like the international opportunity and growing the U.S. market where it makes sense and on balance we still think that 50 to 100 basis points is a \u2013 I think it's very much aligned with how we think about managing the business, Derik. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I think we can always change that dynamic over time, but I think given the growth opportunities that we see, the broad range of innovation we're bringing to the market that requires support, not just from commercial resources but from enabling information technology, we think that's a reasonable balance and outlook for the business. This is clearly a very powerful business model that has a lot of profit potential and \u2013 but we think we're balancing that in the right kind of ways. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: It's a \u2013 building on Brian's comment, it's a virtual cycle, and we can really see that in play in our revised guidance in 2017. As Brian said, we raised the constant-currency operating margin expansion guidance for the year to the high end of our long term of 75 to 100 basis points, and yet that's with augmented investments which we think will help us with longer term growth of that very profitable recurring revenue, which itself will help us with margins. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: So, it's a virtual cycle, and it's driven by an incredible technology portfolio that we have, that quite frankly just gets better and better. I mean, that's what's interesting is, it's gotten better and better over the last five years. Starting with the launch of really back to launch of ProCyte and then Catalyst One and SDMA and SediVue and there's a whole lot going on in the information technology side, and so, we're really in a \u2013 all supported by the fact that people love their pets and are underserved by the veterinary profession today, and meaning that as vets get better at communicating the value of the services that they provide, pet owners respond and that's a lot of what's behind our technology and our commercial investment. So, it's a virtual cycle and we have long-term goals, and we manage that year-by-year within those long-term goals. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Brian, I'll beat you up offline on how the out-year OpEx leverage isn't better than 50 to 100 bps. I'll focus on two other questions. Maybe the first one, on the reference lab, growth was really solid. The growth rate accelerated. I think the stacked growth was actually the strongest that I can see in my model looking back 10 years. So, Brian, can you revisit the international versus U.S. lab commentary? And then, Jon, if you can speak to the long-term opportunity within U.S. reference lab and if you see some opportunities for accelerated market share gains sort of in light of the recent acquisition of Antech by Banfield. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. Just on the performance, then I'll turn over to Jon, but we said it was 13% organic growth. It was actually a little bit higher than that, and it was comparable growth in U.S. and international markets. And to your point, Jon, I think we were up against some really strong compares. So, we agree that it was an excellent performance on the lab front, both U.S. and internationally. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. The growth in reference lab is really three factors. One is that we're getting some price realization. Of course, everybody said, well, why did you offer SDMA at no incremental charge? Well, we did offer it at no incremental charge, but now the chemistry panel that all customers are getting is much higher value. And that allows us to realize price and realize some of that value in price. The second \u2013 and that's not a big number, as Brian said it was, I think, 3% in the quarter, 2% to 3% for the year. That's for all-U.S., but reference labs is a contributor to that, all-U.S. CAG recurring diagnostics. And second is that we are growing our customers that we have. They're growing. And sometimes, the customers don't give us all their lab business, but they're shifting more of their lab business to us. It's kind of hard for us to measure that. But we are growing our existing customers. Part of it is because they're adopting more testing. Maybe they're running more chemistry because it's a better case for preventative care. Maybe they are picking up a molecular diagnostics or fecal antigen that they previously were not \u2013 they were doing manually or just not doing at all. I mean, they're expanding their standard of care. And then the third is that we are adding customers and adding more customers at the same time that we're seeing improved retention rates with our existing customer base. Of course, all of that takes field presence to make that happen. It doesn't just happen. It happens because of our extraordinarily professional sales, professional service vets and the field support representatives that we have in the field that are the face of IDEXX to veterinary practices. And so, we think the opportunity is there on all three of those dimensions to continue to grow. What is actually \u2013 it's interesting, the reference lab is the largest diagnostic modality, largest contributor to our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Got it. Okay. Helpful color. And then, the other one, Jon, is just on the sales force. I get it, I mean, you're putting up tremendous top line growth, and three or six months is an incredibly quick return for a rep. But where do you see that number leveling off? In other words, I think you and I talked on the call, maybe nine or 12 months ago, you upped it and you thought you were where you needed to be, and here you're taking another 10% higher, 25,000 vet practices and over 400 reps. I know they're all not out in the field but that's a big number when your arguably next biggest competitor from a direct basis might be 60 or 70 reps. So, maybe just looking out, is this something where, hey, you can always add 5% or 10% to sort of continue to augment the top line or should we think about a number out there as a finite number to point to where you think you'd have a fully \u2013 a full sales force out there, specific to the U.S.? Thanks, guys. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. Well, I think what we saw is we have seen the tremendous response to our innovation in the field and yet we believe that the constraint here is time with customers. The more we call on customers the faster they grow. And so, it's a tough call. Okay. It's a tough call about when or where or what rate to make incremental investments but obviously we're able to do it and expand our operating margin target for the year which is good. I mean, we feel good about both of those. Where will that go going forward? It's a tough call. The other thing we have going on is we're continuing to see growth in productivity of our field professionals. I just want to correct you on one thing, the 435, those are only the people in the field calling on customers. They include sales reps, they include our field support representatives are highly valued and they include our professional service and veterinarians. They do not include people on the phone that are sales or support. They do not include managers. They're just field feet on the street. It's a very, very clean metric. And so, we think it's the right call. Given the incredible response we're seeing, I mean, the over 1,000 SNAP Pros and the momentum in that business, we actually ended the quarter with a backlog, that's just the number that we installed. That's just \u2013 I remember you asking me about SNAP Pros two years ago, why can't we have more SNAP Pro placements? Well, we got more SNAP Pro placements now. And look at the competitive Catalyst, 18% year-over-year growth in competitive and greenfield Catalyst placements. And look at the 14% EVI productivity. Part of that is coming from the maturation of the sales organization, and part of that's coming from enabling support. We're actually fully moved to a new CRM. We're leveraging the salesforce.com platform, fully implemented now in the U.S. field organization and highly leveraged by the incredible data that we have that helps the rep support the customer. I mean, they have incredible data at their fingertips now, real-time, that helps them engage in very substantive conversations with customers where they can act like true diagnostic consultants how to expand the testing. And because now they have these relationships because they have enough customers, they can call on the average customer 10 times over the course of the year. And that's what we achieved in 2016. We see nice \u2013 that combined with professionalism and the data that they have at their disposal on our innovation portfolio, we see nice returns on that. So, it's an art, but we're pleased to be able to do it and expand our constant currency operating margin target. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks for your time, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Congrats on another excellent quarter. I just wanted to talk a little bit more about the gross margin and particularly with the reference lab. The strength that you guys have noted in terms of kind of accelerating revenue growth there, I would assume that that has your \u2013 one of your highest incremental gross margins dropdown from an incremental test perspective. So, if I run the math, if one-third of your total revenue is coming from this highly incrementally profitable business, you can get to your 50 to 100 basis points of kind of margin target expansion just in that business alone almost. And so, I'm just trying to reconcile how we should be thinking about the rest of the business that's also growing double-digits, that's good margin, when we think about the long-term opportunity to expand beyond the 50 to 100 basis points that was reiterated today. Thanks. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. I do think we see good potential that flows from the incremental growth, as you point out. I think that the \u2013 that is offset to a degree by some of the investments that we're talking about and \u2013 which is supporting the long-term growth of the annuity. And on balance, we think that yields the outcome \u2013 the outlook for 75 to 100 bps is \u2013 of improvement this year is very reasonable in that context. And that's how we look at it kind of in an integrated way. So, I think we're acknowledging that there is good gross profit improvement potential, particularly for growing the recurring CAG modalities at a good rate. And we anticipate continuing to improve on the lab front as we grow. And so, I think we're aligned with that. It's just, it really comes back to, I think, fundamentally, how we are choosing to manage the business in the context of the growth potential that we see for the company. And we are going to balance margin improvement with reinvesting towards the long-term growth potential, and we think that's the way the company has been running for a long time very successfully. And we continue to see, particularly with the innovation pipeline that we have and the global market opportunity that continues to grow, a lot of opportunity to continue on that path. So, that's how we're choosing to manage the margin equation. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. Let me comment a little more about the lab. The lab is a very, very operationally intensive, hour-by-hour type of business, very different than our other businesses. And we are good, and we have the opportunity to get a lot better. And we are making systems and other types of investments that will be leverage-able over time. And it takes a while to roll those out in our different geographies. And we will get very good returns on that. Our primary goal here with the reference lab is to be able to serve the customer consistently and with quality. That is the number one thing that customers care about. They care about that before they care about an advanced test. So, that's table stakes. And so, we want to make sure that we are world-class in that capability. So, I would say with regard to the reference lab, we see long-term, very significant gross margin expansion in the reference lab, but it happens over time as we both get the leverage but also prioritize the customer experience. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I think Jon is making a very important point, just to give you a sense of maybe the tone of the business right now and how we're managing things. We're growing very, very quickly. So, to have the kind of consistent double-digit organic growth in our reference labs, to execute that well, our number one priority is to make sure that we have flawless turnaround times and the capacity to do everything that we need to do to support our customers. And it's not to say that we're not trying to improve as we grow, but that's our first priority and that's certainly where the business context is now. So, on balance, I think we've got a reasonable outlook and we'll continue to try to perform well and deliver against that. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And what it means is there's a lot of long-term runway. It means that the runway is there for many years to come. And it comes back to the enduring opportunity we see not only on the top-line growth but on the margin expansion. It's an enduring number. It may not be as much as you want in any one particular year but it has a long runway associated with it. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks for the color. And then just quickly on the market stats. I know the industry faced a very challenging first quarter comparison, but the data you presented and certainly one of your largest peer also presented kind of a decel. And I'm just trying to \u2013 how do we think about, is this just a comp issue, or is there something perhaps a little bit going on in the end market after two or three years of pretty rapid growth off of the lows? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I really appreciate that question, too, and we measure this with every data source that we can get our hands on, some of which are proprietary to our own systems, and some of which are external validations of all different kinds. And the net of that is we really do not see a change. We don't see a deceleration, we don't see an acceleration. We see the trends that we have seen over the last several years are intact, the same rate. I think the so called deceleration that you saw in Q1 was really a comp issue because, as Brian said, you take the average two year stack growth, it was 6.8%. So... Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: 6.9%, actually. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: 6.9%. Yeah. So, I think that you take the two years, add them together, and divide by two. So, yeah, I think everything that tells us this is kind of steady as you go, 5.5% to 6.5% same-store sales growth market at the practice level \u2013 of course there's a little bit of net practice formation that adds to that, diagnostics is growing faster, all those things, but really kind of a steady \u2013 as far as we can tell, it's steady. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. Congrats again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, guys. Nice quarter and thanks for the questions. The first one is a two-parter, just to clarify on the investments you're making. The extra 45 people in the field, how many of those are going to the so-called white space versus going into an existing territory? And then the second part of that is on the lab capacity. How much of that is going to service existing products versus scaling for the future? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: It's mostly greater coverage in existing territories, and a small part of it is white space expansion. And the capacity is really to support the core lab, the existing products. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And then, my second question is on the international launch of SediVue. Can you just speak to some of the opportunities and challenges? The number dipped a bit sequentially. My guess is that might be a timing issue because you have reiterated your goal for 2,000 for the full year. So, could you just speak to maybe how many placements were in North America versus international in the first quarter? Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: There were only 47 placements in international. So the bulk of that was North America placements. And just for clarity, Mark, we very consistently \u2013 if you go back over time and look at our premium instrument placements, Q1 is typically less than 20% of the full year number. And so that, it's very much aligned with our outlook for 2,000-plus placements. We feel we're right on track and it's very consistent seasonality that we've seen in our business for a number of years. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And what I would say about \u2013 we think in the near term, SediVue is mostly a North American product, a more sophisticated market and such, but the opportunity we have internationally is they could sell a SediVue or they could sell a Catalyst and get much higher consumables. So, our teams are still very focused on Catalyst placements, and that's higher economic value or ROI for them. So, SediVues are typically in the more sophisticated markets that are add-ons to existing customers, but I think you're going to \u2013 and we haven't completely rolled out SediVue internationally \u2013 it's going to occur over the course of the year. And so \u2013 but I think you're going to see it being mostly in the next couple of years, mostly a North American opportunity whereas Catalyst One is the international opportunity. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our final question will come from the line of David Westenberg with C.L. King. Your line is open. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: All right. Hey. Thank you for squeezing me in, and happy Friday. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you. Appreciate it. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: So, I'm going to stay away from the margin for you guys, and then just want to talk real quickly about capital deployment strategy. You've been buying back shares a lot in the last year, couple years. Is that still a primary focus in your capital deployment strategy? Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yes, we're comfortable. We've had a very successful program. We've bought back $3.2 billion worth of stock at an average price of $27 a share over time. So, this has been a long-term strategy that's had very good outcomes. We look at this on an ongoing basis. We try to understand our business strategy and the intrinsic value we see in the company, and to the degree that we have cash flow beyond the investments in the core business that we're generating, if we think there's value in share repurchases, we'll continue to allocate capital that way. That's been our past practice and we continue to have that level of confidence and that's what we were signaling today. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Got you. All right. And then can you talk about, it looks like a little bit of a low volume quarter in terms of veterinary practice volumes, but reference lab and consumables were pretty \u2013 you had pretty much a blowout quarter there. Can you talk about how volumes correlate on a quarter-to-quarter basis with your consumable and reference lab businesses? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Well, as you can tell, it's not that great a correlation. I think, it's because we're expanding the diagnostic category; whereas, the clinic revenue is the entire revenue of the clinic of all customers, whether they are customers or not. Diagnostics is typically 15% of the total and a growing percent. So, there are going to be some disconnects between our innovation-based market expansion strategy in the diagnostics and software categories versus the entire practice revenue growth. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. When we report the market numbers, that's a same-store number for all sales in the clinic, and we believe diagnostics, itself, in the market is growing 1.5 to 2.5 points above that when you add in practice formation and our \u2013 the fact that diagnostics is growing quicker. And, of course, we're growing faster than market. So, I think those are the dynamics that contribute to the differences. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. Have a good weekend. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. I think that concludes the call. We appreciate all the questions. Again, I just want to thank everybody who dialed in And, again, congratulate our IDEXXers around the country and around the world for a great quarter and pursuit of the purpose to be a great company, that creates exceptional long-term value for our customers, employees and shareholders by enhancing the health and well-being of our pets, the people who love them, and livestock. Thank you very much. That closes the call. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude you conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference Service. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thanks, good morning everyone. IDEXX delivered excellent financial results in Q2, building on our strong start to 2017. In terms of highlights, Q2 revenues of $509 million reflected 10% organic revenue growth at the high-end of our expectations. Our growth continues to be driven by expansion of recurring CAG Diagnostics revenues, which increased 13% organically in the quarter to $380 million or 75% of total revenues. These gains were driven by 14% organic growth in the U.S. with strong gains across each of our modalities and 12% growth in international markets, despite a relatively tougher compare in Europe related to the later timing of the Easter holiday. Strong revenue growth supported another excellent quarter of profit performance. Operating profit of $123 million, increased 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by a 180 basis point year-on-year improvement in gross margins, reflecting high recurring CAG Diagnostics growth, supported by moderate pricing gains and ongoing productivity improvement. EPS for the quarter was $0.95 per share, an increase of 30% on a constant currency basis. These results included $0.08 per share or about 11% of EPS growth benefit from the adoption of new share-based compensation accounting guidance, which was also relatively higher than expected. Reflecting our strong first half performance we're raising our full-year 2017 financial guidance today. We're increasing our 2017 revenue outlook by $17.5 million at midpoint to $1.945 billion to $1.965 billion. This reflects an updated outlook for organic revenue growth of 10% to 11% and approximately $13 million of benefit from changes to FX rate assumptions, reflecting the recent strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. We're raising our full-year EPS guidance to $3.12 to $3.22, an increase of $0.14 at midpoint, reflecting approximately $0.04 of operational improvement, $0.02 per share in benefit related to favorable FX changes, net of hedge affects and approximately $0.08 per share related to raised projections for 2017 benefits from stock compensation accounting changes. Our updated EPS outlook reflects expectations for full-year operating margin gains of 100 basis points to 125 basis points as reported or 110 basis points to 135 basis points of improvement on a constant currency basis, while we advance incremental commercial, R&D and enabling IT investments to position us for sustained strong organic revenue growth. We'll review our updated 2017 outlook in more detail later in my comments. Let's begin with the review of our Q2 performance by segment and region. Q2 performance was again driven by our Companion Animal Group; global CAG revenues were $440 million, up 11% organically, supported by continued strong gains in recurring CAG Diagnostics revenues and solid growth in our veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging system businesses. These gains offset relatively lower instrument revenues reflecting comparisons to strong prior year placement levels and impacts from our increased emphasis on high economic value placements, which resulted in lower year-on-year second Catalyst placements and hematology upgrades in the U.S. Water revenues of $29 million grew 7% organically in Q2, supported by solid gains in Europe and Latin America including benefits from our go-direct initiative in Brazil. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues grew 4% organically to $34 million as we benefited from continued strong growth in China, improved performance in our herd health screening business and continued expansion of our recurring pregnancy testing franchise. These gains offset moderately lower revenues related to successful Europe bovine disease eradication programs and in our Dairy business reflecting market demand impacts related to lower milk pricing. For the second half of 2017, we continue to target flat to modest growth in LPD overall. By region, U.S. revenues were $360 million, up 10% driven by high growth in our CAG business. Recurring CAG Diagnostics revenues in the U.S. grew 14% organically in Q2, reflecting strong double-digit gains in consumables and lab revenues and continued solid growth in rapid assay. Recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue gains continue to be primarily volume driven with overall net price gains trending at about 3% aided in the first half by some favorable year-on-year comparisons related to promotional activity. IDEXX's performance continues to significantly outpace solid U.S. veterinary practice growth, reflected in our data set from approximately 5,000 clinics. In Q2, patient visits increased 2.8% and clinic revenues increased 6.8%, reflecting continued healthy market momentum. International revenues in the second quarter were $193 million reflecting 10% organic growth driven by 12% recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue gains. Recurring CAG growth continues to benefit from robust consumable gains driven by expansion of our Catalyst instrument base and related increases in average test utilization. These gains offset impacts from a later timing of the Easter holiday, which was in Q2 this year versus in Q1 last year, which moderated European CAG recurring revenue growth in the quarter as expected. For the first half overall, international recurring CAG Diagnostics revenues increased 15% organically, compared to the U.S. at 13% with strong gains across modalities and major regions. In terms of segment performance, our Q2 results were supported by strong global gains across CAG Diagnostics testing modalities and continued expansion of our premium instrument base. Globally, we placed 2,680 premium analyzers in Q2, including 1,191 Catalysts, 861 premium hematology instruments and 628 SediVues. We also placed 1,811 SNAP Pros in the quarter with accelerating momentum following our rollout of enhanced auto read capabilities. We continue to achieve high levels of competitive Catalyst placements in North America benefiting from our expanded commercial organization and our focus on maximizing the economic value. In Q2, we placed 341 Catalysts at competitive or greenfield accounts, a growth of 14% year-over-year. This represented 82% of total North American Catalyst placements. International Catalyst momentum also continues to be strong with close to half of these placements going to new and competitive accounts. As we in parallel support the expansion of SediVue in a wider range of international markets. Globally our installed Catalyst instrument base increased 21% year-on-year in Q2, reflecting 11% year-on-year growth in North America and 37% year-on-year gains in international markets. Global Instrument revenues for IDEXX were $28 million in Q2 down 13% organically, compared to strong prior year results, which included benefits from higher second Catalyst placements. In Q2 of 2016, we placed a 131 second Catalysts in North America as part of the successful customer retention program, which declined to 48 units this Q2, creating a headwind to report an instrument revenue growth this quarter. Note that while these second Catalyst placements contribute to instrument revenue, they do not on their own contribute meaningfully to incremental consumable revenue. Our emphasis on the economic value or EVI of placements in the U.S. also shifted emphasis towards competitive Catalysts, SediVue and SNAP Pro placements, which resulted in relative declines in focus on hematology upgrades. We continue to be very pleased with the execution of this new approach, which resulted in double-digit year-on-year increase in our EVI metric related to North America instrument placements in the quarter. Growth in our instrument customer base supported by high retention levels and utilization benefits from the expansion of the Catalyst platform in international markets is driving continued strong momentum in consumable revenues. Instrument consumable revenues of $132 million in Q2 grew 17% organically. These gains reflect continued high-teens organic growth in international markets and accelerated double-digit growth in the U.S. including benefits from the expansion of SediVue, which contributed 1.8% to global consumable gains in the quarter. Reference laboratory and consulting services with revenues of $171 million, grew 13% organically in the second quarter, supported by higher growth in the U.S., which offset moderated international gains impacted by the later timing of the Easter holiday in Europe. Strong U.S. lab trends reflect continued momentum from the differentiation provided by SDMA, which is increasing customer retention, as well as from high growth in test panels with proprietary IDEXX parasitology and Lab 4Dx Plus Tests. Rapid assay revenues also continued to trend very well with Q2 revenues of $60 million up 9% organically. Rapid assay gains reflect continued strong growth in 4Dx and specialty tests and progress regaining share in first generation products in the U.S. We expect rapid assay growth will moderate to the mid-single-digit growth range in the second half, as we begin to lap relatively stronger prior year performance levels and are impacted by select factors including fewer business days and less favorable year-on-year comparisons related to promotional activity. Veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging system revenues were $32 million in the quarter, up 9% organically. VSS gains continue to be driven by increased penetration of recurring services in our Cornerstone installed base. Diagnostic imaging system revenues also increased solidly supported by growth in digital radiography-based placements and recurring services, including growth in our Web PACS platform. Turning to the P&L, operating profit in Q2 was $123 million, up 18% as reported or 19% on a constant currency basis, with results driven by very strong profit gains in our CAG business. Operating margins were 24.1%, up 180 basis points in the constant currency basis, driven by gross margin gains, reflecting continued strong momentum and expanding CAG recurring diagnostic revenues supported by moderate price gains and ongoing productivity improvement aided by volume leverage. For the first half of 2017, we delivered approximately 220 basis points of operating margin improvement on a constant currency basis, building on the 170 basis points of adjusted constant currency improvement, delivered for the full year of 2016. The new guidance we're providing today indicates we're on track towards 280 basis points to 305 basis points of adjusted constant currency operating margin improvement combined in 2016 and 2017, well ahead of our long-term goals. We're delivering these results while advancing increased investments in certain areas, aligned with sustaining our accelerated revenue growth. These investments will moderate our year-on-year operating margin improvement in the second half of 2017 compared to our very strong first half gains. We'll talk more about our second half outlook as we review our updated 2017 guidance. For Q2, reported gross profit was $293 million, up 12% or 14% on a constant currency basis. Foreign exchange hedge gains, which benefit gross profit, were $750,000 in Q2. Operating expenses in Q2 were up 9%, driven primarily by higher investment in sales and marketing resources. Expense growth increased in Q2 as we began advancement of incremental investments in U.S. commercial capability with some delay in the initial phasing \u2013 in the phasing of initial ramping costs, which created favorability in our Q2 results compared to our quarterly outlook. We expect to see higher levels of year-on-year operating expense growth in the low teens range in the second half of 2017 related to increased U.S. commercial resources, enabling IT programs and R&D initiatives. We also recently announced the acquisition of rVetLink which will add an important dimension to our growing software and connectivity capability. This acquisition and related development initiatives will add about $2 million to $3 million of incremental operating expense in H2 of 2017, including transition costs with limited initial incremental revenues. These costs are factored into our updated financial outlook. EPS in Q2 was $0.95 per share, including $0.08 per share in benefit from adoption of new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation. Tax benefits from share-based compensation continue to trend higher than originally projected, reflecting the significant recent appreciation of our stock price and higher levels of activity related to the expiration of specific stock compensation grants. For the full-year, we now project benefits from adoption of the new accounting guidance in the range of $0.30 to $0.34 per share or about $0.08 per share higher than our last estimates. This is obviously a dynamic area and higher levels of benefits in 2017 reflect timing of stock option grants and effects from the significant recent increase in our stock price. As we'll discuss in clarifying our tax rate outlook, we projected about $13 million of the after tax benefit we expect to see in 2017 or about $0.15 per share will not flow through to future years. Aside from the benefits from the new accounting adoption, Q2 EPS results were supported by share repurchases, which lowered year-on-year shares outstanding by 1% net of a 0.5% negative impact related to adoption of the new share-based compensation accounting guidance. Our effective tax rate was 25.5% in Q2, including 6.2% of tax rate benefit from share-based compensation accounting adoption, foreign exchange net of hedge impacts in Q2 2016 and 2017, lower quarterly operating profit by $1.4 million and EPS by $0.01 per share. Free cash flow was $95 million for 2017 in Q2, on track with our full-year outlook for free cash flow of approximately 95% of net income and projected full-year capital spending of $90 million. Our outlook for continued strong free cash flow generation, aligned with our very strong business momentum, supports allocation of capital to share repurchases. In Q2, we deployed $114 million to repurchase 700,000 shares in the open market bringing year-to-date repurchases to $165 million for 1.1 million shares or an average price of $152 per share. We ended Q2 with $1.309 billion in debt outstanding, $423 million in cash and investment balances and $145 million in borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 2.7 times gross and 1.8 times net of cash and investment balances. Turning to our 2017 outlook. As noted, we're increasing our full-year revenue and EPS guidance ranges, we're raising our reported revenue guidance by $17.5 million at midpoint to $1.945 billion to $1.965 billion, reflecting our expectation for organic revenue growth of 10% to 11%, as well as about $13 million in revenue benefits from relatively more favorable foreign-exchange rate changes. At the updated FX rates noted in our press release, we now project that our reported revenue growth will be reduced by about 0.5% in 2017, related to the year-on-year strengthening of the U.S. dollar. In terms of our operating margin outlook, as noted, we're projecting annual improvement on a reported basis of 100 basis points to 125 basis points, which equates to 110 basis points to 135 annual basis point improvement on a constant-currency basis. This higher constant-currency outlook reflects our strong first-half performance and momentum in growing CAG recurring diagnostic revenues. For the second half, we expect operating margin gains will moderate as we lap strong prior-year gross margin performance and invest in expanding our regional customer-facing capability in the U.S., advance our R&D and enabling IT agenda and integrate the rVetLink acquisition. In terms of EPS, we're raising our 2017 outlook to $3.12 to $3.22 per share or an increase from our previous $2.95 to $3.11 range or approximately $0.14 per share or higher at midpoint. This equates to 17% to 19% EPS growth adjusted for currency changes and share-based compensation accounting impacts, aligned with the long-term financial goals. Our higher EPS outlook is driven by three factors; first, we're projecting $0.04 in operational benefit, related to our strong organic growth trends and our raised full year constant currency operating margin outlook. Note that this reflects about $0.06 of projected operating improvement offset by about $0.02 of impact from the rVetLink acquisition. Second, favorable FX changes are projected to contribute $0.02 of benefit compared to our last guidance assumptions. At the rates assumed in our press release, FX changes are projected to reduce 2017 operating profit by $7 million and EPS by $0.03 per share, net of a projected $3 million or $0.03 per share benefit from hedges. In terms of our 2017 outlook as a sensitivity to rates assumed in our press release, a 1% weakening of the dollar across our currencies would raise 2017 revenues by $3.5 million and operating profit by about $900,000 net of hedge impacts. Please note that while not all of the favorable FX change year-to-date will benefit 2017 results given previously established hedge positions. These changes, if they hold, will benefit future years as hedge contracts expire. Third, as noted, we expect $0.08 per share of incremental benefit from adoption of the new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation. On our last call, we had estimated that our effective tax rate for 2017 would be about 32% prior to these impacts, and we're maintaining that outlook. In terms of benefits from reflecting the tax deductibility of share-based compensation in our P&L under the new accounting guidance, we're raising our expected tax rate benefits on these fronts for the full-year of 2017 to 7% to 8%. This reflects in an updated estimated, in an updated estimate for our 2017 full year effective tax rate of 24% to 25% and this assumes an effective tax rate for the second half of 2017 of 26% to 27%, somewhat higher than the first half, reflecting accelerated option exercise activity earlier this year. The projections for our effective tax rate in 2017, aligned with an estimated $27 million to $30 million benefit in tax reduction related to share-based compensation activity. As noted, a portion of the tax rate benefit in 2017 is related to specific factors, including the timing of exercise of stock options which are not expect to carry over into future periods, based on our analysis of future vesting schedules and historical activity. For future years, we estimate that the annual benefit from share-based compensation activity will be $14 million to $17 million, assuming our current share price and no change in U.S. corporate tax policy. This is approximately $13 million below projections for 2017, which equates to about 3.5% of tax rate benefit in 2017 or $0.15 per share EPS benefit, which we do not anticipate will carry over into future periods. Our outlook for share count in 2017 is for reduction in average shares outstanding from stock repurchases of approximately 1.5%, net of a 0.5% accounting impact. We're projecting net interest expense of approximately $33 million, assuming a relatively consistent current gross leverage ratio. In terms of our third-quarter outlook in 2017, we expect Q3 reported revenue growth in the 9% to 10% range, reflecting organic gains of 9.5% to 10.5% offset by a modest FX headwind. As noted in earlier calls, we will see a 1% reduction in organic revenue growth in Q3 and Q4 of 2017 related to fewer business days, which is factored into our outlook. Year-on-year operating margin improvement in Q3 is expected to be 0 to 50 basis points on a reported basis compared to the prior-year third quarter. This equates to 10 basis points to 60 basis points of constant-currency improvement. While we're targeting continued solid operating margin improvement, Q3 gains will be moderated reflecting higher levels of operating expense growth, from our U.S. commercial expansion, R&D initiatives and acquisition integration, as noted. We're targeting solid continued gross margin improvement, but also expected moderated level of year-on-year gross margin improvement for Q3, compared to very strong first half gains. That concludes the financial overview, let me turn the call over to Jon for this comments. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Okay, hey, thank you, Brian. Indeed a strong quarter with constant-currency revenue and EPS gains and an outlook for the year that is at the high end of our long-term growth goals. This reflects continued strong market growth and outstanding execution by our teams with our highly impactful direct sales coverage model, driving an even higher growth for our business. Also the weaker dollar provides a tailwind as we're a net exporter of technology products. Global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth of 13% constant-currency benefited from exceptional performance from our U.S. commercial team, achieving 14% CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth. Some notable accomplishments in North America, double-digit growth in the productivity of instrument placements using our economic value index, which measures the value of different instrument placements in contributing to recurring revenue growth and profitability. Note that we didn't have a significant change in the field resources in place that are responsible for instrument placements over last year's quarter. So this is essentially all productivity. In Q3, we have in place the expansion of our U.S. sales organization. Part of this EVI was contributed by 14% growth in competitive Catalyst placements year-over-year and SediVue placements continued to be strong. Reference lab growth in the U.S. pulled up the global average for this CAG Diagnostic modality. And in rapid assay, our field professionals achieved tremendous momentum in placing SNAP Pro units at over 1,800 for Q2, the vast majority in North America, which grew 300% year-over-year. SNAP Pro is giving our field professionals a great reason to talk about our highly differentiated rapid assay SNAP line, which saw another quarter of strong growth, led by SNAP 4Dx Plus in the North American market. Clearly, even after 15 years in the market vector-borne disease testing, aka tick-borne disease, remains a developing market and by highlighting SNAP Pro and the SNAP line in general, our commercial organization is bringing new attention to the importance of vector-borne disease screening with 4Dx. In fact, we just released a seminal analysis that uses big data to demonstrate a significant increased risk of chronic kidney disease with dogs exposed to the tick-borne diseases of Lyme or Ehrlichia. So, now we appreciate that testing for exposure to tick-borne disease is more important than ever. We also appear to be continuing to recover the volumes in first-generation rapid assay sales that eroded during the transition to the fully direct in 2015. In Q3, we have put in place a 12% expansion of the sales force in the U.S. market with additional territories. The hiring and training associated with this expansion is essentially complete and we have about 430 field-based professionals in place to start the new quarter. With the expansion we have both new reps to IDEXX and a U.S. territory reconfiguration that evolves about 8% of accounts with a change in IDEXX account professional. We anticipate some moderation in U.S. growth in H2 over the very strong year-to-date performance as it typically takes at least a quarter for reps to settle into their new territories and we will be up against relatively tough compares in rapid assay that will moderate growth from the very strong first-half gains. We also have about 1% of growth headwind with fewer business days. Having said that, our model of customer coverage has proven to be exceptionally successful in both growing the market for diagnostics for customers that use IDEXX, the expanded toolkit and also look forward to the benefits of this further-expanded U.S. commercial presence over time. As we move into 2018 with this expansion fully settled into place, we'll also benefit from productivity initiatives such as fully leveraging our new customer relationship management system, up the EVI model for instrument placements, as well as more effective digital marketing support. And of course, we will have significant new product introductions. Europe was solid in Q2 with CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth impacted by year-over-year timing of Easter, which is a major four-day holiday in Europe unlike the U.S. And as we indicated, this would be the case. Asia-Pacific and Latin America continue to be our fastest-growing global regions. Global gains continue to be driven by the expansion of the Catalyst customer base generating high-teens year-over-year consumable gains with years of runway ahead. We are seeing an increasing percentage of international Catalyst placements to new and competitive accounts, reaching almost 50% in the second quarter. Overall, our CAG dynamics are very strong globally with a unique innovation driven growth, high and improving customer retention, strong pricing gains and high profit flow-through enabling us to support growth investments while delivering strong financial results. Let me turn to a couple of technology pipeline updates. We are very pleased to add the rVetLink team to IDEXX in Q2. rVetLink is an exceptionally successful cloud-based application that solves the issue of communication and medical record sharing between the specialty referral hospitals and their referring DVM clients. rVetLink adds an attractive recurring revenue business model to IDEXX that will also further add value to our practice information management systems offerings, including Cornerstone, DVMAX and Neo in North America. All three of these practice information management systems are strategic product offerings that will also continue to be a development priority, including, but certainly not limited to embedding the rVetLink functionality. The rVetLink acquisition comes with a seasoned and talented leadership team. We welcome them to the IDEXX family and their SaaS-based solutions to the IDEXX ecosystem. Of note, rVetLink is the seventh in a growing ecosystem of cloud-based offerings offered by IDEXX. We also continue to see great opportunities to address our customer information technology needs with our ecosystem of products, including both client-server and cloud-based platforms by taking client-server applications to the cloud and through leveraging the data that is created by these systems. These continue to be R&D investment priorities for IDEXX. We remain on track for two important product launches within the next year, as I referenced earlier, Catalyst SDMA and SNAP Fecal. Both products will generate direct revenues. Importantly, they also add value to the entire IDEXX diagnostic offering and thus provide a multiplier effect on the growth of our core recurring diagnostic revenue. Let's take a look at each. Catalyst SDMA, a new slide for Catalyst, will contribute to instrument revenues directly, as it is a new test. In addition, the new test makes Catalyst instrument even more unique, supporting the expansion of our in-house chemistry customer base. Finally, by providing SDMA on Catalyst, we accelerate the growing recognition of SDMA as an essential parameter to the core chemistry panel, whether run at the point of care on an instrument or sent to the reference lab. We are on track to introduce Catalyst SDMA by the end of 2017 in the North American market. As expected, with estimated annual revenue growing to roughly $50 million or more within five years for this one test alone on Catalyst. SNAP Fecal will become in time a major category of our rapid assay business, directly adding to the annual revenue growth with potential rapid assay revenue in five years, also of about $50 million or more. SNAP Fecal also has a multiplier effect and that it adds value and attention to the SNAP family and makes SNAP Pro even more valuable as a device that assists in practices in running all SNAP products in the family, thus supporting our entire rapid assay product line. SNAP Fecal also brings further attention to our unique Fecal antigen technology, which is used in SNAP Pro and also used at the reference lab, for those customers who prefer a send-out protocol for their Fecal testing and yet value the unprecedented accuracy advantage that antigen technology adds to traditional methods. Again, we remain on track for the launch of SNAP Fecal in mid 2018 as expected. Both of these products are examples of how IDEXX innovation is uniquely driving profitable growth of veterinary diagnostics and thus IDEXX's CAG recurring revenues. We are combining new and augmented technologies with evidence-based medical insight, increasing the clinical value of diagnostic testing and thus the motivation and justification to run more testing. And we know that pet owners prioritize spending on their pets when the benefit to the health of their pet is apparent to them as it is with this medical-based insight that we're bringing to the market. With this differentiated and augmented set of medical tools, it is no surprise that IDEXX's veterinary customers are growing their usage of diagnostics faster than the market as a whole to the benefit of the pet and the pet owner, the veterinary practice and to IDEXX. This dynamic is one of the reasons we remain confident in the long-term target of 10% plus constant currency revenue growth for IDEXX as a whole. So, with those opening comments, we'll now open it up to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Jon Block form Stifel. Your line is open. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys and good morning. Maybe two. The first one just your thoughts on international CAG recurring traction. I think it was plus 17% in the first quarter, still a robust 12%, but slowed to 12% in 2Q. You guys certainly called out the timing of Easter, but just want to make sure anything else at play there, the step down from 17% to 12%, were there any markets in Europe that may have pulled back a little bit, maybe if you can just \u2013 can provide some overall color across the international landscape specific to CAG recurring? And then I've got a follow up. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, great. Thank you. It's a big holiday in Europe, Easter four-day holiday, and it was in the first quarter last year and then second quarter this year. So I think the best way to look at Europe is the first half growth and that sort \u2013 that normalizes for that. That was 15% recurring revenue growth internationally versus 13% for the U.S. So that's that 200-basis-point delta that we typically see. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. If you adjust both quarters for that, Jon, it's a pretty consistent trend. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, okay. Brian and then, of course, I got to push you a little bit on the leverage. The guidance implies a pretty big step-down in the amount of constant currency operating margin expansion in 2H relative to what we saw in 1H. Of course, Jon, you've alluded to the increased investments that you guys have made more recently. Brian, I guess, maybe two things, how do we think about that leverage as we go into 2018? Maybe you can give us some details around the timing of it. In other words, do you absorb the heightened level of spend in 3Q and 4Q and then we go to a more normal cadence once we enter into 2018? Thanks guys. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: We'll obviously provide more clarity on that as we get towards our preliminary guidance. But I think what we're signaling is that we're going to have low teens OpEx growth in the back half of this year and you would expect, just given lapping, Jon, some of that's going to carry over into the first half of 2018. As we add the resources, we'll obviously have a higher level of resources that we have in the prior year. We're still confident that we can deliver good operating margin improvement. We do think it's going to be moderated because of that in the second half, along with just some relatively less favorable compares on the gross margin front. But we feel good about being positioned to continue to deliver our 50 basis points to 100 basis points of annual operating margin improvement on a constant-currency basis which is our long-term goal, and we'll share more insight on that as we get closer to 2018. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Jon, I just want to add to those appropriate comments by Brian. Obviously, the investments in the U.S. organization have generated a very attractive return in accelerating growth of the recurring diagnostic revenue that we've seen in the first half of this year, 13%, and the second quarter being 14%. I think what we're finding is the more we call on customers the faster they adopt our more expanded toolkit of diagnostics, and it turns out when you have more tools you use them more frequently and they find more disease and this is a reinforcing dynamic. And so while it takes a little while for this \u2013 it'll take a little bit while for this 12% expansion to settle in, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we've got some very significant productivity initiatives that are already in play, that we're already seeing the benefits from, combined with some additional new product launches with the SDMA on Catalyst, which is going to be very, very big for us in the North America market, even in the global market. And SNAP Fecal which will be very, very big for us in the North American market where Fecal testing is already an established protocol, mostly using in-house microscopy manual method. So we think these are proven to be very attractive ROI investments. But as Brian mentioned, they take a little time to kick in. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Understood. I'll follow up on the instruments offline. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple of follow-ups on some of the investments you're making. I guess number one on the expansion in the customer facing units. I'm curious, as you spend more time with vets and techs, if your teams are not only focusing on educating them on your products and product launches, but also how to increase overall lab utilization with pet owners, meaning wellness program initiatives, seasonal screenings, parasitic outbreaks et cetera that drive greater utilization at the point of care? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. Ryan, actually it's a great question and we're seeing our customer grow faster whether they're growing \u2013 one of the drivers of reference lab growth is the same-store sales with our customers. As Brian mentioned in his comments that's being driven in part by some of the technologies were being in the market, Fecal antigen testing is really taking off in the reference lab and driving same-store sales growth and 4Dx when customers choose to send that to the lab. We also have some very successful programs to drive the growth in preventive care with our customers, which \u2013 and we're going to talk a little bit more about this at the Analyst Day, but the medical justification of running diagnostics in a preventive care across both dogs and cats and all ages is very, very strong and yet still really very, very underutilized. So when our veterinarian \u2013 when our diagnostic or veterinary \u2013 VDCs, the veterinary diagnostic consultants engage with customers towards advancing a preventative care, we see a very dramatic growth in their usage of IDEXX diagnostics. This is a much higher growth and it really shows they're starting to kick in the gear. And of course, one of our cloud-based offerings, Petly Plans, aids in the adoption of a preventive care plan, which, while it's not necessary can be helpful to growing a preventative care diagnostics in the customer. So, all of these are trends we see were just starting to crack the code on this accelerated utilization, because we have unique tools, they find more disease, it's sort of a virtuous cycle, customers see the success, they see the clinical efficacy, they see that they are raising the standard of care, they're helping pet owners and pets find and treat these disease earlier. Pets are living longer lives and so they want to do more of it. This virtuous cycle with the customers that are IDEXX customers is a very, very positive. And of course, then we're adding new customers that start to enter this virtuous cycle of utilization growth. It all happens over time, but these are enduring growth dynamics for us. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. That's very helpful color. And then as my follow-up one on the R&D spend. I guess, can you talk a little bit more about how much of that is currently going towards commercialization or development of some of the products you've already announced, like moving SDMA on to Catalyst and the SNAP Fecal versus focusing on novel testing areas on the pure research front? Thank you. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Well, we have \u2013 it's really all of the above. We, of course, support existing products, for example, our \u2013 as I mentioned seven cloud-based offerings and our practice information management system, these are software offerings that are continuing to add a functionality. We see the opportunity to leverage cloud technology with our client-server applications over time. So in the software area, it's not \u2013 it's new, but it's also really expansion and growing the value of that entire ecosystem and how it works together seamlessly to drive very, very attractive clinical and financial outcomes for our customers. Of course, we've got the new products that we've announced SDMA on the slide, which is going to be really big for us and we're right on track for the launch at the end of the year. And then SNAP Fecal, which will be \u2013 the SNAP Fecal will be the most significant product launch since 3Dx in 2002. And as I mentioned in my comments, 15 years later, we're still seeing growth in vector-borne disease testing. These are very, very long-enduring cycles and so we're going to start a whole \u2013 another long-enduring cycle with the SNAP Fecal. Of course, we have other things in our pipeline that we haven't discussed yet because in many cases, these are a multiyear development efforts. But I'm going to tell you, what our commercial organization is very busy with our current and projected offerings. In some cases, Ryan, we have to hold things back. And so let me just give you an example. We have a great new test on Catalyst called CRP. This is an inflammatory marker, chemistry marker. We launched in Europe because the European market appreciates \u2013 certain countries in the European market appreciate the benefit of CRP. The U.S. market is completely uneducated on CRP. We haven't even launched it in the U.S. We don't want to \u2013 we're going to launch it eventually, but we just don't want to try to do too many things and each of them half done. And so, we are not gated by new \u2013 the innovation, we're more gated by the commercialization. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse : Great. Thanks. Can you speak to kind of how the incremental sales force in commercial investments that you've already made to-date are taking hold, I guess, what are you seeing quarter-to-date or the sales force that perhaps ramping up according to plan and how should we think about that influencing the quarterly progression as instrument placement trends in the next two quarters? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, thank you. As I've mentioned, it's a 12% expansion and the vast majority of that is reducing the number of customers that a rep is servicing and thus increasing the intensity of the calls, creating a stronger relationship. So that involves some territory reconfiguration and about 8% of our accounts will therefore have a new rep. Sometimes they're just \u2013 they're an existing rep, but they're new to that portion of the territory and of course other times it's a rep that's new to IDEXX. As we've done with the expansion in 2015, the added reps are very highly experienced and occasionally they also come from the very territory with some other animal health OEM. But it does take time to learn our product line and it does take time to get settled in and we typically see that's going to be a quarter of investment and then they start to sort of begin to pay for themselves in the second quarter, but then we have a long period as they grow their relationships and their competency, where we see growing productivity. But of course, we also have the benefit of ongoing relationships with the other 92% that aren't changing as a result of this expansion and we will be adding, as part of this expansion, we're adding in the second half year more professional service veterinarians which are highly appreciated by the customer and we've also added more of the field support reps, which are involved in the adoption of these protocol changes. So it's a \u2013 we've seen that as we add intensity of coverage, we see very nice response with our customers who adopt diagnostic protocols faster, and it's such a deep market. Everything that suggests it's such a deep market that this has good ROI, Erin. Thank you. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse : Okay. Great. And then on SediVue, can you speak to how the feedback has been in the field and placements were pretty strong, has there been any surprises from a consumable utilization standpoint per customer and can you speak to ways you could potentially enhance the utility of SediVue or potentially better leverage the algorithmic interpreted software? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Well, thank you very much for that comment. We saw really nice customer response to the Neural Network 2.0 software offering, which as you know just gets launched behind the scenes, fully launched in the early part of second quarter. And that continued to advance the diagnostic algorithms. That's not the last one, we're going to have another one in the first quarter of 2018, called Neural Network 3.0 that will continue to leverage the tens of millions of images that we're getting. I would say again everybody wants this to happen faster. We think that urine is underutilized. We know that roughly 50% of the urine that is run on SediVue provides results that are medically significant, meaning, some kinds of observations in the urine that is very medically significant and helps rule in certain types of diseases. That's a very high rate, close to 50%. We ran a free UA day, which we can do because of the pay per run, where they only pay when they run the analyzer. We say when you run the analyzer, this one day, you don't have to pay. And we saw over 600 customers run seven times the amount of urine that they would have run on a normal day. And on the incremental results, we found over a third of those results provided remarkable diagnostic findings. This just shows underutilized urinalysis is. Our current projection is still 3,000 or 4,500 per year in recurring revenue per instrument placement. We hope to grow that gradually over time; we're around 1.1 runs per day on average. Obviously, some customers are higher than that, other customers are lower. But the opportunity to run and the value of running urinalysis is still very, very significant and, of course, SediVue makes it easier to do so. It's one of these protocol changes that allow customers to grow their diagnostic utilization without heavy load on the technician productivity. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Good morning. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Can you hear me? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yes. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, yes. Good morning. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Oh, great. Thank you. Sorry, I'm remote today. So, when you launch SDMA on the Catalyst, clearly an important product launch, how do we think about the incremental consumable pull through as we look into 2018? And what does that do, do you think to the consumable numbers, I'm just curious. And then how do you look at \u2013 do you have any data on how many of people that are sending out to your services just do SDMA only and have Catalyst systems. I'm just curious on potential utilization that way? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: There's all sorts of interesting good things that happen and yet they've all happened slowly over time, now when they \u2013 when a customer adds SDMA to a Chem CLIP that'll be an incremental roughly $7 for us. And so really the question is to what degree will we see customers adding the SDMA slide to the Chem CLIP over time. And that'll be a gradual thing just like it was with when we launched the T4 on Catalyst and it adds a small amount, but every year it adds \u2013 continues to add more and more. And so \u2013 but the other thing that we know is that we have a cohort of customers that have our full in house suite including Catalyst, but don't use us for the reference lab, but because they're in a contract they can't get out. But they value SDMA and so we may see a shift towards more full panels being run in-house with this cohort of customers, again these are very difficult things to model, but we're really seeing very nice traction in SDMA being more and more viewed as an essential element of the routine chemistry panel and for those customers that have Catalyst, this will be \u2013 but don't \u2013 are don't have ready access to our reference labs, this will be a way that they can change to that protocol, so. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: As Jon noted, we estimated over five years, we think they can build a $50 million and or more. So... Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: That would be $50 million in just Catalyst revenue associated with the SDMA slide, that's our estimate. That doesn't include the multiplier effect of growing utilization or growing the recognition of SDMA, or growing our reference lab or all the other things that we believe this will help. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. That's very helpful. And just one follow-up. I really appreciate the commentary on the SPC tax implication, that a lot of the other companies that are reporting these gains are calling out the fact that they're going to have headwinds in 2018 from this. So I'm just curious, is there a general, is there any rule of thumb to think about incremental X amount of increase in the stock price, could potentially drive an incremental benefit from this, I know timing of these options is really hard to do, but I'm just wondering if there is any sort of rule of thumb we can use? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Don't have that handy, I think that's something we can try to bring some clarity to over time because that obviously has one impact, and the other impact, that's harder predict, is how do people behave. So, I apologize we don't have that specifically... Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: We don't have that specifically, but that's a \u2013 as we continue to work on our PhD and stock share-based compensation impacts, we'll add some of that over time. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the color. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: No, problem. Operator : Thank you. We will go to the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys, congrats on another strong quarter. Just want to talk a little bit about margins in sales force density, as you look at your commercial infrastructure. At what point in time, do you think that we perhaps will level out there a bit more. And then think about maybe accelerating the long-term guidance on margin improvement? Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I think the \u2013 we've gone through some phases on the increases in our sales and marketing capability. I think the history has shown, this has been a very high return area for investment, we're obviously focused on growing our core business. We did a reset, if you will, once we went direct, and I think that you see the benefit of that playing out now and we've got a more modest reset here going on in the next few quarters. I think over time, we do think we can get leverage out of sales and marketing, but we want to always leave the opportunity open to invest incrementally towards incremental growth, we're growing the market, we think this requires resources, and we'll continue to monitor that over time. And that's all factored into our long-term view of the 50 basis points to 100 basis points of operating margin improvement. I think that there's potential to deliver more on that, but we want to balance that with always having an eye towards the significant long-term potential we see for growth in this company. And we'll \u2013 as we move towards Investor Day, we're going to \u2013 we'll be spending more time on that and helping you understand the benefits of that approach. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, thanks for the comments, Nick. Just to add to that, margin expansion is a good thing, Brian mentioned with our new guidance we'll have 280 to 305 basis points on an adjusted constant currency basis over the combined two-year period, 2016-2017. Margin expansion is a good thing, organic growth is a good thing, accelerating organic growth is a good thing. Some of that comes from incremental investments, of course, that also helps with gross margin expansion. I think it's a very favorable dynamic that we are \u2013 that we are working here. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks for that color. And then just on the reference lab, certainly it's interesting to see your U.S. growth continue to accelerate relative to your peer group that's seeing some level of moderation. So just maybe want to dig a little bit deeper into the share gains that you're seeing in the U.S.? And then more importantly, where are we in the cycle of your guys' gross margins within the reference lab as we think about that being a pretty big lever for growth longer-term in operating income? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yes. Thank you for those comments. I want to comment that our reference labs are doing very, very well in the U.S. market. A significant portion of that is the same-store sales growth from our customer base. And because they're adopting some of our unique differentiated offerings that aren't available to customers that don't use our reference lab. And this really comes from the fact that our veterinary diagnostic consultants are \u2013 their commission is based on territory revenue growth. And that comes from any CAG recurring diagnostic growth including same-store sales and reference labs. And so, we're really seeing a nice growth again in the Fecal antigen area, in the reference lab version of 4Dx and some of the specialty tests. And then, when we add a new customer \u2013 oh, by the way that growth also means that customers are adopting protocols that are only unique to IDEXX. And it increases the retention of our IDEXX reference lab customers, and of course, the retention is increased as they appreciate that SDMA is an essential element of their routine chemistry panels. So, we're seeing gradually improving off of very strong retention ratios. And then, as we add a new customer, what's really interesting is they start growing faster, with the reference lab utilization. And then, we're going to share this with \u2013 the results with \u2013 at Analyst Day, which I think investors know will be a Reg FD event, everybody will have the benefit of this. We also note that actually customers that run more in-house diagnostics grow their reference lab business; they're higher reference lab growers. It turns out, and we're going to show this with big data. Testing begets testing. The more in-house testing that customers do, the more reference lab testing they do, it's an amazing dynamic. These are our customers because these are all \u2013 a reinforcing integrated offering. I can't comment on with regard to customers that don't use us, because they don't have the tools, the toolset, the expanded toolset that we're providing. But it's an interesting dynamic. One would normally think, hey, if I'm going to do more in-house, I do less reference lab. No, the more in-house you do, the more reference lab you do. And so that's another factor that's contributing to the growth in our reference lab business. And indeed, the expansion of the diagnostic market with customers who are using IDEXX expanded toolkit. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I'll leave it at two. Thanks, guys. Congrats again. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And one moment please. Our next question will come from the line of David Westenberg with C.L. King. Your line is open. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question and then, congrats on another good quarter. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Can you just give a little bit more color on the free SediVue utilization \u2013 the free SediVue utilization day in terms of what you might have saw afterwards. Was there a spike, was there a continuous usage in those customers that used it? And if that is the case, is this something you might do on a regular basis, if testing begets testing in this particular case? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. It was an exceptionally successful market initiative that actually had very, very high ROI, because the foregone revenue and the marketing costs on it were relatively low. We're just now fully beginning to appreciate as a result of digging into the big data, how profound impact it had on the patient care. But like everything in veterinary medicine, changes in clinic protocols, they happen slowly, they may happen with a subset of customers very rapidly. As I said, we have 600 to 700 customers, who really participated in the UA Day in such a way that they greatly expand their testing that day. But, of course, that's a small fraction of our SediVue installed base in North America. But it is \u2013 it shows the power of the pay per run model and some of the creative marketing that we can do with that. And I suspect that we'll continue to find ways to drive the utilization growth because the opportunity is so large in relation to the current standards. It's hard to parse all this out in terms of the impact that it's having because you've got seasonal factors. We've only been in the market for a year; we barely have year-over-year data. Obviously, there's a little bit more testing that's run in the summer when practices are busier than run in the winter. And so, but it's got to be a good dynamic, as I said, we're right now about 1.1 runs per day, it's really shocking how low that is. And I think even vets themselves are shocked with how low that is. So we see the opportunity to grow that. But I'm not going to say, it's going to change to 1.5 overnight, this takes time. And of course, we're continuing to grow the install base in the meantime. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. That's very helpful. And then just a very, very quick clarification question, you mentioned the slide pricing of SDMA being $7. Was that up from $5 or was it always $7? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: We're just getting closer to launch and we're getting closer to what \u2013 this would be a bundled price if they buy it. The list price for the SDMA slide will be $16 or $17, but we'll have a bundled discount when they buy it with a CLIP which should be the incremental price of the SDMA when you add it to a CLIP purchase, that will be about $7 and this is specific to U.S. These are U.S. numbers. So we're just getting a little bit more specific on that as we get closer to the launch. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Fine. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I don't think we fully, we finalized it. But I think we're \u2013 that's pretty close to the neighborhood we're going to be in, in the bundled discount pricing which we would expect would be the majority of the slide-only purchases. Of course, the majority of our customers also run T4 in combination with their panel and when they add SDMA to their T4, they will come at no incremental charge. But that's a very low, T4 which is just underutilized too. So less than 10% of Catalyst run in the U.S. add a T4. So the vast majority of what we think will be the impact will be SDMA added to the CLIP without T4; although it may grow T4 utilization too. It's just a lot of moving parts, they're all good. We just don't know what degree they will move in and at what rate. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you very much and I look forward to seeing you in a couple of weeks and again congrats on a good quarter. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you very much. Operator : And our final question will come from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Unknown Speaker : Hi. This is Max, (01:04:48) on for Mark. Thanks for the question and congrats on the strong quarter. So first, SediVue, can you speak to the number of countries you're launched in today? And perhaps could you add come color about where you're launched now and where you're expecting to launch later this year? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much for that question. We are, over the course of the first half of 2017, we launched in the major European countries, some of those were first quarter, some of those were second quarter and we're also launched in Australia. And but I'm going to tell you what's interesting is SediVue is playing a nice role, but the big, big opportunities in these markets continue to the Catalyst placements, which are a lot for an individual instrument they have a higher impact on growth and recurring revenues of the consumable \u2013 the instrument consumables. So in other words, they're EVI, the EVI of a Catalyst placement is still significantly higher than the EVI of a SediVue placement. So therefore SediVue plays a \u2013 what I would call a supporting role, but it's not a primary role. It supports winning competitive customers, it supports advancing existing customers, filling out the suite, but really the primary objective for instrument placements internationally even more so in the U.S. is continuing to take to upgrade or put in the Catalyst, which are, are what's generating that high teens VetLab consumable growth that we're seeing in the international markets. But we \u2013 it did contribute the international SediVue placements did contribute to meaningfully to the year-over-year growth in SediVue the 628 units that we place globally. Thank you. Unknown Speaker : Great, thanks, and as a follow-up in terms of monetizing your patient data, I know it's an extremely small percentage of your business today. Do you foresee any new verticals or areas where your lab data may be used to help some of your partners develop greater insights, whether it's in pet food or perhaps in new areas of pharmaceuticals? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: This is really very early days. What we're really finding, right, and we \u2013 of course we do have a data business where we support some of the other players in the industry as you said on the pharmaceutical or diet side that appreciate their markets and support the execution of their marketing strategies, which are by the way very complementary to our strategies. It helps grow the market and also a small revenue source for us. But what we're really \u2013 the larger impact we're seeing right now with this big data is these advanced medical insights. I mean, I just mentioned the seminal work that used 850,000 patient data points that demonstrated that the length between exposure to Lyme Disease or Ehrlichiosis and increased risk of chronic kidney disease in the dog, which of course supports both our 4Dx product line as well as our kidney test to SDMA, which finds kidney disease earlier. This is a phenomenal big data, evidenced-based work that we will published, we're out in the field, but it's only the beginning of what we see are the \u2013 medical insight. What we're showing here, and we're going to talk a little bit more about some of the work at Analyst Day is how underutilized diagnostics are in advancing care in the pet. And we know the pet owner wants this. I mean, we know pet owners love their pets, we've talked about; we'll talk about that some more. And so, we're really finding that through this evidence-based medicine, how powerful role diagnostic, how powerful role diagnostics played \u2013 plays when it is used to assess and monitor the health status of a patient and yet the utilization is still very, very low in relation to what would be medically justified. And so, this is our Companion Animal business, and if we can have, even a couple points of impact on the growth of the Companion Animal business that will be lot of value creation for IDEXX shareholders, who come from our big data, well and doesn't preclude us from other ways that we can use the day. I don't think there is any question that we're in the lead in the industry in using big data to provide insight to the industry on how to advance the standard of care. Unknown Speaker : Great. Thanks. And one more if I could. On instruments, how should we think about your opportunity to place a second Catalyst in the clinics in either North America or beyond \u2013 and has the lion share of placing a second Catalyst \u2013 already taking place? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, we're going to continue to place second Catalyst, when the customers need the throughput and \u2013 and that's \u2013 so that's still part of our standard program, it's is just a \u2013 I think we have some catch-up to do, and it really \u2013 it really, even with the growth, but the second Catalyst is more satisfying the customers need. It doesn't generate it helps their capacity, but doesn't have any meaningful impact on the growth of their recurring revenues that we can deliver this over the short period of time, although it's certainly a good thing to do. So, it plays a role, but it's a minor role. Unknown Speaker : Great. Thanks for the question. And congrats on a great quarter. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : And with that, Mr. Ayers, I'd like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Well, thank you \u2013 thank you very much. I appreciate everybody joining on in the call. Again, I just want to congratulate the IDEXX team on really what was an exceptional quarter, the number of opportunities that we're finding to serve our customers is truly amazing. And for investors, we look forward to sharing in more detail the opportunities we see for this market going forward at our Analyst Day which will be webcast and Reg FD for all of investors to benefit from. So with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude you conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference Service. You may now disconnect.",

We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we'll take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Good morning and thanks, everyone for joining us in our call. Today I'll take you through our Q3 results and outlook for the full year. I'll also provide an overview of our preliminary guidance for 2018, Jon will follow with his comments. In terms of our results for the third quarter, we delivered revenue of $492 million or growth of 10% on a reported basis supported by 1% year-on-year benefit from foreign exchange rate changes. Organic recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth was strong in the quarter at 11% despite over 2% in combined growth headwinds from fewer equivalent days in the quarter, year-on-year changes in distributor inventory levels in international markets and natural disaster related impacts. Overall organic growth for the quarter was 9%, below our expectations for 9.5% to 10.5% gains. The largest element of the shortfall related to the combined growth impacts noted, which lowered overall organic growth by about 2%. This was about 1% above the growth headwind we had previously projected related to fewer equivalent days heading into the quarter. We also saw greater than expected end market pressure on our LPD business, as well as some changes in our CAG instrument program mix which resulted in relatively higher levels of deferred instrument revenues in the quarter. We'll discuss these factors in more detail as we review our quarterly performance and our revised 2017 organic growth outlook. Despite these impacts we continue to leverage high recurring CAG revenue gains to drive strong profit flow-through keeping us on track towards our full-year EPS growth goals. Operating profits in Q3 grew 14% as reported and 13% on a constant currency basis, supported by continued strong gross margin gains. EPS for the quarter was $0.79, an increase of 27% on a reported and constant currency basis. These results included $0.03 per share of discrete benefit from the expected utilization of foreign tax credits and $0.04 per share from the adoption of new share-based compensation accounting guidance. Adjusted for these factors comparable constant currency EPS growth was 16%, on track with our goals. Today we're refining our 2017 revenue guidance and raising our EPS outlook to reflect benefits from discrete tax items and a higher projection for full year operating margin gains. Our new revenue outlook of $1.95 billion to $1.96 billion is consistent at midpoint with our prior guidance reflecting reported growth of 10% to 10.5%. We're maintaining an outlook for CAG Diagnostics recurring organic growth of 12.5% to 13%, consistent with very strong year-to-date trends. We're updating our outlook for full-year organic growth of 9.5% to 10%, incorporating natural disaster related impacts, a lower projected growth rate for our LPD business, consistent with recent trends, and adjustments to our outlook for instrument revenues reflecting expectations for relatively higher levels of deferred instrument revenues this year based on our projected program mix and current accounting treatment. These impacts are fully offset by favorable FX changes. We're raising our projections for 2017 EPS to $3.22 to $3.26 per share, compared to our earlier guidance of $3.12 to $3.22 per share, or an increase of $0.07 at midpoint, including about $0.05 of per share benefit related to discrete tax items. This updated EPS outlook equates to 18% to 20% comparable constant currency growth adjusted to exclude EPS growth benefits related to share-based compensation accounting changes and discrete tax benefits. This outlook incorporates higher expectations for reported and constant currency operating margin gains of 130 basis points to 150 basis points this year, resulting in approximately $0.02 of operational improvement from our earlier guidance, net of refinements to our organic growth outlook. Our updated 2017 outlook assumes $0.12 to $0.15 per share in EPS benefit from stock compensation accounting changes and $0.05 per share in discrete tax benefits, which are not expected to benefit future years. This is factored into our 2018 preliminary outlook, which we're also sharing today. In terms of our 2018 preliminary outlook, we're projecting revenue of $2.14 billion to $2.18 billion and EPS of $3.50 to $3.62 per share with comparable constant currency revenue and EPS growth aligned with our long-term financial goals. Our 2018 revenue outlook reflects expectations for 9.5% to 11.5% reported revenue growth driven by 9% to 11% organic gains. As we'll discuss later in reviewing our preliminary guidance, we currently estimate that the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard will have an immaterial net impact on our revenue in 2018. Our EPS outlook assumes achievement of 75 basis points to 125 basis points of improvement in operating margins on a reported and constant currency basis, approximately 25 basis points above the improvement outlook shared at our recent Investor Day. On a comparable constant currency basis, that is adjusted to exclude share-based compensation impacts and discrete tax items, this preliminary outlook equates to 15% to 19% EPS growth compared to midpoint 2017 projections. We'll discuss our 2017 and preliminary 2018 outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our Q3 performance by segment and region. Q3 performance was led by continued strong momentum in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were $427 million, up 10% organically, supported by double-digit gains in recurring CAG Diagnostics revenues and in our veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems businesses. These gains were offset by relatively lower instrument revenues impacted by comparisons to strong prior year results, as well as by relatively higher levels of deferred revenue recognition, which we'll discuss in more detail as we review our product line results. Water revenues of $31 million grew 10% organically in Q3 supported by solid testing gains in the U.S. and benefits from international go-direct initiatives, which added about 3% to quarterly growth. As noted, Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues declined 7% organically to $28 million. This was about $2 million to $3 million below our flat to modest organic growth outlook for the quarter. Recently, our LPD business has been impacted more than anticipated by end market factors that are pressuring producers that use our diagnostic tests. European deregulation of milk quotas has lowered milk pricing globally. In addition, imports of powdered milk has been increasing in China, depressing demand for local milk for consumption and for production of dairy products. Combined, these factors had the effect of lowering dairy producer demand for antibiotic testing, pregnancy testing and health herd screening for cattle. In addition, regulations controlling pork prices in China have led to the closure of farms. And recent poultry disease outbreaks have reduced demand for live poultry, both of which have constrained growth in demand for our diagnostic tests. For our business, this has lowered revenues in our dairy testing and health herd screening businesses globally and moderated the strong growth trends we've seen in emerging markets. While we expect these dynamics are transitory and will stabilize and improve over time, we are updating our outlook for the LPD business in the near-term to reflect continued mid-single digit declines in organic revenue growth. This results in about a $5 million of reduction to our previous LPD revenue outlook for 2017. By region, U.S. revenues were $301 million in Q3, up 9% organically driven by continued strong recurring CAG Diagnostics gains. U.S. recurring CAG Diagnostics revenues grew 11% organically in Q3, despite over 2% in growth headwind from the combined impact of fewer equivalent days in the quarter and natural disaster effects. Gains were driven by very strong continued growth in U.S. labs, double-digit gains in consumable revenues and solid growth in rapid assay. Recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue gains continue to be primarily volume driven with overall net price gains trending in the 2% to 3% range. Overall, U.S. revenue growth was moderated by lower instrument revenues related to comparisons to strong prior results, which included benefits from SediVue backlog order fulfillment and higher levels of second Catalyst placements, as well as growth in deferred revenue related to instrument placements. IDEXX's performance continues to significantly outpace continued strong U.S. veterinary practice market growth, reflecting our dataset from about 5,000 clinics. In Q3, patient visits increased 1.9% and clinic revenues increased 6%. National disaster impacts could be seen in moderated September patient visit growth of 0.9% and practice revenue growth of 4.8% compared to July and August average growth rates of 2.4% and 6.6%, respectively. International revenues and in the third quarter were $191 million reflecting 8% organic growth, with overall gains moderated by declines in our LPD business, as nearly 90% of LPD revenues came from international markets. International results were driven by continued strong 12% recurring CAG Diagnostic organic revenue gains, despite over 2% of combined growth headwind in the quarter related to fewer equivalent days, and year-on-year changes in distributor inventory levels in certain markets. International CAG recurring growth continues to be led by robust gains in consumable revenues, reflecting ongoing rapid expansion of our Catalyst installed base. In terms of segment performance, our Q3 results were supported by strong global gains across CAG Diagnostic testing modalities and ongoing expansion of our premium instrument base. Globally we have placed 2,738 premium analyzers in Q3, up 6% compared to prior year levels or 13% when normalizing our comparisons to adjust for prior year fulfillment of SediVue backlog orders. These results included 1,385 Catalyst placements, which were up 14% globally. We also placed 848 premium hematology instruments, 505 SediVue's, and 1,373 SNAP Pros in the quarter, bringing year-to-date SNAP Pro placements to over 4,300. By region, we continue to achieve high levels of competitive Catalyst placements in North America. In Q3, we placed 292 Catalysts at competitive or greenfield accounts, in line with strong prior year levels. Competitive placements represented 80% of total North American catalyst placements, reflecting our strategic focus. We continued to see a shift in our premium instrument placements toward competitive Catalyst, SediVue and SNAP Pro in the U.S., aligned with our economic value or EVI metric which increased in the quarter on a basis adjusted for prior year SediVue backlog fulfillment. International Catalyst momentum continues to be very strong with over 1,000 placements in the quarter, with close to half of these placements going to new and competitive accounts. Globally, competitive placements increased 19% in Q3. This progress and continued improvement in retention has supported a 21% year-on-year global expansion of our Catalyst install base to just under 28,000 units reflecting 10% year-on-year growth in North America and 36% gains in international markets. Overall, instrument revenues declined $2 million in the quarter to $29 million compared to strong prior year results, which included fulfillment of our backlog of about 160 SediVue orders post-launch and about 80 more second Catalyst placements as part of our successful retention programs. The implementation of our expanded sales force reconfiguration in the quarter in the U.S., which is now complete, also had a moderating effect on Q3 placement gains as we work through this change. As noted, reported revenue results in Q3 reflected an increase in levels of deferred revenue recognition related to customer program mix. As context, in the U.S. we offer different customer programs for instrument placements with some involving deferred revenue recognition aligned with multiyear agreements, which enhance customer retention. We've seen an increase in CAG instrument placements that are tied to cross category customer commitments that include upfront payments or points. This is aligned with our expanded penetration of new instrument platforms, such as SediVue as well as with our accelerated growth in the reference lab business. Under current accounting, instrument revenue recognition related to upfront commitments is deferred over time rather than at the time of placement, with net impacts of these commitments allocated across instrument and consumable revenues. These changes reflect a shift in the mix of deal types rather than a change in pricing dynamics and we continue to expect net price realization on related recurring revenues in the plus 2% to plus 3% range. In addition, we expanded bundled rental programs in select international markets in Q3, which supported high levels of placement growth in these markets and also resulted in instrument revenues being recognized over time. Our revised full-year 2017 revenue guidance has been adjusted to reflect our Q3 instrument revenue results and updated projections related to customer program mix resulting in a $5 million reduction to our prior full-year organic revenue growth outlook. Growth in our instrument consumer base supported by sustained high retention levels and utilization benefits from the expansion of the Catalyst platform in international markets is driving continued strong momentum in consumable revenues. Instrument consumable revenues of $129 million grew 13% organically in Q3 supported by strong gains across U.S. and international markets, despite about 3% of combined growth headwind from fewer equivalent days, international distributor inventory changes and natural disaster impacts. Our SediVue installed base continues to expand and contributed 1.7% to consumable growth in the quarter. Reference laboratory and consulting services, with revenues of $168 million also grew 13% organically in the third quarter. We estimate fewer equivalent days and natural disaster impacts reduced lab revenue growth by about 1% in Q3. Strong reference lab gains were supported by continued mid-teen organic revenue growth in the U.S. reflecting double-digit organic volume gains with existing customers, augmented by solid price realization and net customer additions. International reference lab gains were solid in the quarter with organic revenue growth at high single-digit rates driven by consistent gains in Europe. Rapid assay revenues continued to trend well, Q3 revenues of $51 million grew 4% organically net of an estimated 4% headwind related to fewer equivalent days, international distributor inventory changes and natural disaster impacts. Rapid assay gains continue to reflect solid volume growth in 4Dx and specialty tests and progress from gaining share in first generation products in the U.S. As expected, growth moderated somewhat from high first half levels reflecting relatively less favorable comparisons related to the timing of promotional programs. Veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging revenues were $33 million in the quarter, up 10% organically driven by increased penetration of recurring services in our Cornerstone installed base and solid growth in digital radiography placements and recurring services, including growth in our Web PACS platform. Turning to the P&L, operating profit in Q3 was $100 million, up 14% or 13% adjusted for currency, with results driven by continued strong profit gains in our CAG and Water businesses. Operating margins were 20.4%, up 80 basis points on a constant currency basis. Gains were driven by continued solid gross margin gains reflecting momentum and expanding CAG recurring, diagnostic revenues, supported by moderate price gains and ongoing productivity improvement, aided by volume leverage. For Q3, gross profit was $274 million, up 11% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis. With the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar, we recognized $900,000 in foreign exchange hedge losses in gross profit in Q3. Overall foreign exchange, net of hedge impacts in Q3 2016 and Q3 2017 lowered quarterly operating profit by about $400,000 with no material impact on EPS. Operating expenses grew 10% in Q3, in line with revenue growth and slightly favorable to our earlier projections as we advanced increased commercial and technology related investments in the U.S. We've now reached our staffing goals for the U.S. commercial expansion and expect year-on-year operating expense growth in the low teens range in Q4. EPS in Q3 was $0.79 per share, including $0.03 in discrete tax benefits from the expected utilization of foreign tax credits and $0.04 per share in benefit from the adoption of new accounting guidance related to share-based compensation, which was about $0.01 below our expectations. Looking forward to Q4, we are projecting an additional $0.02 in discrete tax benefit related to expected utilization of foreign tax credits and about $0.05 of benefit per share from share-based compensation impacts, which is factored into our updated 2017 outlook. For the full year, we now expect benefits from the adoption of the new share-based compensation accounting guidance of about $0.30 per share, which is about $0.02 below the midpoint of our last guidance estimate. Q3 EPS results were supported by share repurchases, which lowered year-on-year shares outstanding by 2.1%, net of a 0.5% negative impact related to adoption of the new share-based compensation accounting guidance. Our effective tax rate was 23.4% in Q3, including 4.2% of tax benefit from share-based compensation accounting adoption, and 3% of benefit from the discrete foreign tax credit. Comparable constant currency EPS growth in the quarter was 16%, adjusting for share-based accounting and discrete tax effects. Free cash flow was $95 million in Q3, on track with our full-year outlook for free cash flow of about 95% of net income, and projected full year capital spending of $90 million. In Q3 we deployed $50 million to repurchase about 300,000 shares in the open market, bringing year-to-date repurchases to $215 million for 1.4 million shares or an average price of $154 per share. We ended Q3 with $1.296 billion in debt outstanding, $454 million in cash and investment balances, and $163 million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 2.6 times gross and 1.7 times net of cash and investment balances. Turning to our 2017 outlook, as noted, we're refining our full-year revenue guidance and raising our EPS outlook to reflect benefits from discrete tax items and a higher projection for full-year operating margin gains. We're narrowing our reported revenue guidance range to $1.95 billion to $1.96 billion or growth of 10% to 10.5%, reflecting a consistent full-year revenue outlook at midpoint. As noted, we're maintaining an outlook for CAG Diagnostics recurring organic growth of 12.5% to 13%, consistent with our strong year-to-date trends. We're updating our outlook for full-year organic revenue growth to 9.5% to 10% from earlier guidance of 10% to 11%. This updated revenue outlook incorporates expectations for full-year natural disaster related impacts of about $2 million, a lower projected growth rate for our LPD business, resulting in a $5 million reduction to our earlier outlook and a $5 million adjustment to projections for reported instrument revenues reflecting relatively higher expectations for deferred instrument revenues this year under current accounting standards. These revenue impacts are fully offset by favorable FX changes. At the updated FX rates noted in our press release, we now project that FX will have a modest favorable impact on reported full-year 2017 revenue growth and a $0.01 negative impact on EPS, primarily reflecting the lapping of 2016 hedge gains. For the full-year 2017, we're now projecting hedge gains of approximately $1 million. Our updated full-year 2017 organic revenue outlook reflects expectations for 9% to 10% organic revenue growth in Q4, including expectations for an approximate 1% headwind related to fewer equivalent days and natural disaster related impacts. As noted earlier, we're raising our outlook for full-year 2017 reported and constant currency operating margin improvement to 130 basis points to 150 basis points reflecting updated FX estimates. In terms of our EPS, we're raising our 2017 outlook to $3.22 to $3.26. This guidance includes a projected $0.05 in discrete tax benefits related to the expected use of foreign tax credits and about $0.02 per share in net operational improvement driven by higher expectations for operating margins. FX benefits of $0.02 per share relative to earlier guidance offset $0.02 of less projected benefit from share-based compensation impacts in 2017. Adjusting for share-based compensation accounting impacts and discrete tax effects, our 2017 EPS outlook equates to 18% to 20% comparable constant currency growth, at the high-end of our long-term growth plans. We continue to estimate that our effective tax rate for 2017 would be about 32% prior to benefits from share based accounting changes and discrete rate benefits. We're refining our estimate for the full year benefit from shared-based compensation accounting changes on our effective tax rate to about 7%. This includes a projected $5 million or $0.05 per share benefit in Q4. We also project an additional 1% discrete tax benefit from expected utilization of foreign tax credits, including expected $1 million to $2 million or $0.02 per share benefit in Q4. Incorporating these factors we now estimate a full year effective tax rate for 2017 of about 23.5% and a Q4 effective tax rate of 24% to 25%. The projections for our effective tax rate in 2017 align with an expected $27 million full year benefit from tax reduction related to share-based compensation activity. A portion of this tax rate benefit in 2017 is related to specific factors including the timing of exercises of stock options, which are not expected to carry over into future periods based on our analysis of future vesting schedules and historical activity. For future years, we now estimate that the annual benefit from share-based compensation activity will be $13 million to $16 million, or about $0.15 to $0.18 of per share benefit, assuming our current share price and no change in U.S. corporate tax policy. This means that $0.12 to $0.15 of net EPS benefit projected in 2017 is not anticipated to carry over into 2018. Combined with the discrete tax benefits recognized this year, this means that $0.17 to $0.20 per share of associated EPS benefit recognized in 2017 is not expected to carry over into future years. We've adjusted for these dynamics in our preliminary 2018 outlook. For the full year 2017, our outlook for share count is a reduction in average shares outstanding from stock repurchases of about 1.5%, net of a 0.5% accounting impact. We now project net interest expense of between $32 million and $33 million. As we look ahead to 2018, we're targeting continued strong revenue and profit growth, consistent with our long-term goals. As noted, our preliminary revenue outlook is $2.14 billion to $2.18 billion, reflecting expectations for 9.5% to 11.5% reported revenue growth, driven by 9% to 11% organic revenue gains. Our 2018 outlook reflects expectations for sustained strong organic growth in CAG recurring diagnostic revenues, supported by our launches of SDMA on a slide and our Fecal antigen SNAP. In 2018, we'll be adopting the new revenue accounting standard ASC 606 under the modified retrospective method. This means that we will be applying the new standard in 2018 and reflecting a cumulative adjustment to our balance sheet accounts for prior years, assuming that the standard had been in effect for those periods. Based on our analysis to-date, we estimate that the implementation of the standard will have an immaterial net impact on our overall revenue recognition in 2018. Note that this reflects in our estimate of the combined impact of the modified retroactive restatement and the change in timing of revenue recognition for 2018 activity. On balance, we expect the new standard will result in relatively earlier revenue recognition for IDEXX over time when instruments are placed, aligned with the principles of the accounting standard. Turning to our preliminary EPS guidance for 2018, our outlook is for EPS of $3.50 per share to $3.62 per share. As noted, this outlook assumes a full year increase of 75 basis points to 125 basis points in operating margins on a reported and constant currency basis. At the rates assumed in our press release, we estimate FX will increase revenue growth by about 0.5% and EPS by about $0.02 per share, net of established hedge positions. Adjusting for changes in currencies, share-based accounting benefits and discrete tax effects, this equates to a projected 15% to 19% comparable constant currency growth rate next year compared to the midpoint of our 2017 EPS guidance. As noted, our 2018 outlook assumes $13 million to $16 million from share-based compensation accounting. These benefits are reflected in our projected 2018 effective tax rate of 28.5% to 29%. We're projecting to generate relatively less uplift in EPS growth from capital allocation leverage in 2018 reflecting expectations for a 1% reduction in shares outstanding and relatively higher floating interest rate costs, which contribute to current projections for a $3 million increase to interest expense next year to $35 million to $36 million. We look forward to providing an update and more detailed review of our 2018 guidance in our year-end conference call. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the discussion over to Jon for his comments. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Brian, for that detailed and fully transparent review of our Q3 results and our guidance. And as I step back, I'm very, very pleased with our continued progress in expanding our business in the third quarter, reflected in strong CAG recurring growth and expansion of our premium instrument platforms, while delivering strong margin gains, keeping us on track towards our long-term goal of 15% to 20% comparable constant currency EPS growth. Adjusted for the factors that Brian noted, which impacted organic CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth by about 2%, our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue grew 13% in the U.S. and 14% international, reflecting the robust durable momentum in expanding our annuity base, driving strong profit flow-through and positioning us for continued strong financial performance in 2018. A key initiative we are advancing to sustain our enduring CAG recurring revenue growth is our enhanced commercial capability in the U.S., an expansion which we completed at the beginning of Q3. As we enter the fourth quarter, we have moved beyond the expected transition impacts to sales productivity, as the new IDEXX representatives begin to build experience and develop their relationships with customers. Even during this transition quarter in the U.S. we saw growth in the EVI of our instrument placements, adjusting for last year's delivered SediVue against preexisting backlog. The Q4 trends, though early, suggest patterns in the past still apply with a jump in productivity as the new reps build on their customer relationships and move to commission-based compensation for instrument placements. Instrument unit placements were strong in Q3, supported by 19% global growth in placements of competitive and greenfield Catalyst chemistry analyzers. In international, we had a record quarter of Catalyst placements in Q3 and also a record quarter of total premium instrument placements in the quarter. Continue to expand our instrument customer base around the globe. Our customer retention rates for U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues remain at exceptional levels of 97% to 98% for reference labs and instrument consumables respectively. And in fact, trends in Q3 continued to show further modest improvement in both modalities. Customer retention rates internationally for reference lab instrument consumables are even higher, at 98% to 99%, demonstrating the unique and irreplaceable value of our innovations in the eyes of our customers. While we were disappointed in our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy Q3 revenues, this business has historically been more volatile. It remains an important part of our portfolio with this proprietary line of animal health diagnostics and leveraging the same technologies that we use in our companion animal business. Our Water business had an outstanding quarter of 10% organic growth and 47% operating margin. In addition, Water had two favorable regulatory developments that bode well for growth in the next several years, one in the U.S. market for wastewater and one in the European market for drinking water. In the new product pipeline, we continue to make good progress in the planned launch of two exceptionally strategic tests, Catalyst SDMA in the next few months, and SNAP Fecal DX in mid-2018. The enthusiasm for our Catalyst customers for SDMA is exceptionally high as we continue to build the franchise for this unique and proprietary kidney function marker as an essential element of the chemistry panel, whether run in-house on Catalyst or sent out to the IDEXX reference labs. SDMA has the benefit of a growing number of third-party studies and the impact of almost 12 million patient samples run in our reference labs over the past two plus years. SNAP Fecal DX will build on IDEXX's proprietary Fecal antigen technology, that we now offer in our reference labs, and itself is a meaningful driver of growth of same-customer volumes in our North American labs. We have an attractive pipeline of new product development resulting from our over $100 million annual investment in R&D, that will generate future product launches, a pipeline that remains as attractive as ever, even beyond Catalyst, SDMA and SNAP Fecal. The pipeline includes instruments, menu, veterinary software, artificial intelligence and Big Data capabilities. In the latter two technologies, we have over 250 employees in software R&D focused on expanding the capabilities of our existing cloud and client server-based software offerings as well as the Big Data opportunities. Also included here is the further advancement of our cloud-based VetConnect PLUS, a platform that adds unique and growing value to our diagnostic offerings worldwide. The combination of our innovation and expanded commercial strategies gives us confidence for our 2018 guidance of 9% to 11% organic revenue growth, and as Brian mentioned, the 75 basis point to 125 basis point expansion in constant currency operating margin. So with that, we'll open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for all the color commentary thus far. I was hoping to dive a little bit more into the delta and your assumptions behind revenue recognition for the instruments. And my curiosity is that driven by a change in the instrument sales mix that you're seeing towards different products, is it more bundling or is it kind of a novel program, or end market response to the competition, just any more color what's driving that delta? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, thanks. It is basically a change in the mix of previously established programs. Programs can have different kinds of revenue recognition. We are focused on, particularly the metric, economic value index, and we see those holding steady. And I think we've given the results there, the 19% growth in Catalyst placements at new competitive accounts, the EVI that's up in North America despite the Q3 transitions. So, I think the fundamentals of the instrument placement are strong and the revenues are a reflection of program mix. Brian, you have further comment? Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. As Jon said, it's existing programs and more an evolution that we've seen relatively more growth than we were projecting earlier. And I tried to note that we also had some growth in international markets, we have rental programs in emerging markets which are doing quite well, and that also results in very good placements, great EVI, but you don't recognize the revenue upfront. So... Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. And in Q3 we had one country that started one of those programs that we've had in other markets to exceptional success. But it's a program that doesn't have upfront instrument revenue. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: So the placements were good, but the mix and how that flows through instrument revenue was somewhat different than we anticipated, and we tried to flow that through for the full year and make an adjustment there. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. That makes sense. And then, I don't recall you talking about international distributor changes in the past kind of impacting performance. So is that just normal fluctuation in distributor inventory, are you seeing different ways that they operationalize their inventory trying to shrink lead times, or seeing less end market demand, or anything else we should read into that, or is that just a normal? Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: It really is, we \u2013 when we went direct in the U.S., we actually stopped normalizing because we had relatively immaterial impacts from this, it's primarily Japan actually. And it just so happened that the year-over-year changes because it's not just this year, it's also what happened last year, was large enough that it kind of had an impact on the growth rate we wanted to highlight. So what we're really trying to note is that the underlying growth when you normalize for hurricanes and these changes in days if you look at the growth rate in the \u2013 as Jon mentioned in international, it's 14%, in the U.S.... Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: In the CAG. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: ...13%, we feel very good about the underlying CAG recurring Diagnostics recurring growth, and wanted to make sure we noted that, so people understand those trends. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse : Great. Thanks. I think your underlying operating margin improvement is slightly higher than what you were alluding to at Investor Day. How \u2013 I guess for 2018, how should we think about sort of that difference, how much of it is attributable to FX and broadly can you speak to maybe the drivers of that metric into 2018? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: It primarily flows from the strong momentum we're having, growing the CAG recurring diagnostic revenues. So we're, as noted reinforced 12.5% to 13% organic growth rate this year and we're looking to sustain that into next year and we have some drivers like SDMA on a slide and Fecal Antigen that will help with that and growth in that part of our revenue stream has really nice gross margins... Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And we're getting 2% to 3% pricing, which is a demonstration of the unique value we're bringing, by the way, it's at constant currency, so none of that is FX related, the 75 basis point to 125 basis point expansion in operating margin would be in a constant currency. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse : Okay. Great. And how should we think about the quarterly progression of SediVue placements, do you anticipate placing a, I guess increasing amount into 2018? And can we get an update on the consumables utilization there, is it tracking better than kind of maybe your initial expectations there? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, I think, we had a very good quarter in SediVues. I think we gave guidance, we did 505. We gave guidance to over 2,000 for the year, I think we're well on track for that. We would \u2013 SediVue is going exceptionally well. We're going to launch the next version of the algorithmic software called Neural Network 3.0 in January, Erin. 2.0 really was an exceptional success that we launched in April of this year. But we're going to get the benefit of over 50 million images now. So, and one interesting thing about urine, it's really important to understand this, is that, if you don't take a picture of the urine when it's fresh, I'm talking about within the first half hour of coming out of the bladder, it changes. I mean, bacteria grows or disappears, crystals dissolve, I mean, you've got to \u2013 the algorithm has to be run on fresh urine and of course one of the benefits of SmartService is we have tens of millions of images. So Neural Network 3.0 is just going to take it to a whole new level. And of course every single SediVue customer will receive that through a SmartService update in January. So, I think we have a good momentum. On the utilization. We're seeing very, very small increases, but we're still really in the 3,000 to 4,500 and maybe a little bit of that, very small modest increase in that. And of course, our goal through things like the free UA day that we can do with the pay per run is to get customers to grow utilizations. It's kind of a shocker that urine is used so little in diagnostics when it provides so much value, but I think that's going to be a long-term trend. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Good morning. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So just a question, you're on the \u2013 how much in year 2018 organic revenue growth guidance, is that benefiting from deferred revenues that were pushed out from 2017 to 2018, just trying to get a sense? And can you just give us an idea on what the recognition timelines you're looking at on those, are you're talking about recognition over one-year, two-year? Just a little bit more color on sort of, are you getting pushes from 2017 to 2018 and just sort of the numbers involved? Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: So that is all captured in the \u2013 we're transitioning to the new revenue accounting standard, Derik. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: In 2018. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: In 2018 and that is all captured in what we reflected as a net immaterial change overall. To give you a sense of this, the things that we talked about, we talked about bundle programs deferred revenue, associated with upfront points and payments. Under the new accounting standard that actually is primarily recognized upfront. So, under the modified retroactive restatement though we're going to have to treat the past as if we were using the new statement in the past. So it \u2013 we're really going \u2013 it gets complicated because we have three different programs, major programs that all have kind of differing changes to them. The net of what comes out of the wash of all that is we don't necessarily see a net material change one way or the other. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And let me also answer your question, typically you either recognize the revenue upfront in one type of program or you basically recognize instrument revenue over a five-year to six-year period. There's no in between. It's not like you recognize it in the second year. It's either amortized or it's upfront. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: So, that's captured in our 9% to 11% and what I did note is, over time in the future, the standard will lead to probably relatively more upfront revenue recognition, which is given the mix of programs that we have. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks, that's really helpful. And I guess \u2013 I may have missed this, but can you \u2013 did you say anything about how you see the Livestock, Poultry and Dairy business trending in 2018? don't think you can gave any specific segment comments. If I missed them, my apologies. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I think \u2013 no we didn't and we haven't given segment guidance in 2018. But we believe that the factors in LPD are transitory in the second half of 2017. I think that's still a solid \u2013 it remains a very solid business with a favorable return on invested capital. And so, we would not expect that to be a longer term factor. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And if I can sneak in one final one, the share count \u2013 the share buyback is a little bit lower for next year, it's a little bit \u2013 some color on that? Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: We're trending right now at about $50 million a quarter and we are \u2013 our outlook for next year anticipates continuing in that range. We think that's \u2013 we feel good about the value of the company and I think we \u2013 it supports continued deployment towards repurchases. We are at a somewhat moderated level from where we've been historically and that's reflected in that outlook. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: What is not reflected is any change in our free cash flow. As Brian said, our free cash flow to net income for the guidance for 2017 is 95%. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. First one, Brian, for you. Why the increase in the op margin expansion guidance relative to the Analyst Day two months ago? Maybe if you can give some color there, and just even maybe more importantly, considering the spend was supposed to be higher in the near-term, is the new long-term op margin expansion guidance, sort of that 75 bps to 125 bps per annum, versus that prior 50 bps to 100 bps plus? And I've got a follow up. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: As, Jon, I mentioned earlier I think the growth in CAG recurring Diagnostics revenues and the continued solid price realization we're getting there is supporting very good gross margin improvement and we're building that into the outlook next year. We're not changing our longer term view on the margin potential of business, it's just the preliminary view for next year. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Right. And I would also say, one of the things that we do between August and this point in time in the late fall, is we build together, we build our plans for \u2013 operating plans for 2018, as we built our plans for 2018, we really saw solid margin opportunity that gave us the confidence for next year of 75 basis points to 125 basis points of margin expansion. And it's going to be primarily gross margin. A lot of good things happening in the gross margin, 2% to 3% net prices is one of them, but favorables on labs and instrument consumables, but so, I mean, as we as we kind of rolled everything together, that gave us the confidence to tweak it up by 25 basis points for 2018. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Understood. I guess what I don't understand is, unless some of that spend was deferred, you would think that new higher rate would carry forward in subsequent years. Again, Brian, based on your prior commentary that the most heightened level of expense was targeted for 2018. But I can follow-up with you offline there? Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Well, we're obviously going to be growing off of higher bases as we move forward, Jon. So, I think we'll continue to look at that, but we're comfortable with the longer-term guidance of 50 bps to 100 bps. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I was going to say, Jon, because you asked for it, but no, it was really the fundamentals of... Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Exactly. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I appreciate that, Jon. And then, just to shift gears, maybe Jon for you. Any change on the color, the exact timing of SDMA on the slide, in other words, next few months to me sounds slightly different than year end, is that a true assumption? And then the international lab was up high single digits. That's a good number, but it is down from the low double-digit range, even mid-teens that you guys had gotten too. I know there was a day adjustment, but that wouldn't account for 300 bps or 400 bps or even 500 bps, so maybe you can talk to what you're seeing in the international reference lab? Thanks, guys. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. First of all, we're very excited. We're in the short strokes on the SDMA on the slide launch. We now have it out with Catalyst customers that are running the slide in practice and producing results and providing data in the care of patients. That's the last step in our development timeline, and just as we get to this level, we always want to make sure that we launch it right. So, we're very comfortable with the next few months timeframe for that. I think what I would say about the reference lab business is, we're \u2013 I think we're pleased with the growth international. I think we're exceptionally pleased with the success of the international had with instrument placements, which are very profitable business model for us and in turn we're very pleased with the continued growth in the U.S. and Canadian reference lab business, which is also demonstrating nice profit flow-through, allowing us to support our profit guidance for 2018 and 2019. So, I think these are, what we're seeing is growth in the profitable areas of the recurring revenue around the world, that's a little differential. But I mean, I don't think the reference to the growth in international reference lab, that Brian mentioned, is anything to sneeze at; obviously these are very good numbers. But I think it was a particularly good quarter for instrument placements internationally. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James. Your line is open. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for all the color. Just two for me. First, just in terms of any sort of flagging associated with kind of the cadence of 2018 earnings growth, certainly some of the new products kind of build through the year, so just wanted to \u2013 I know it's early, but any sort of thoughts on how we should be thinking about the ramp associated with A, the new products and B, the timing of kind of the margin leverage? Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I think it's early for us to be projecting that. I think one thing I would note is obviously we've had some increase in our OpEx base as we staff up in the U.S. and advance some of the U.S. commercial organization and advance some of the IT initiatives, so that'll carry over into the early part of next year in terms of year-on-year growth. But I think we'll wait until we kind of complete our detailed budget processes before we get into that. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, I think these new products, like SDMA on a slide, it's going to be helpful on the margin, I actually think we're getting the benefit of SDMA on a slide now, because customers are anticipating it. So it's benefiting things like the retention rates, that I mentioned that are continuing to improve modestly, and the placement rate in anticipation. So the multiplier effect on the SDMA on a slide is pretty significant and is embedded, of course, in our expectations for overall recurring revenue growth. And then there's also a multiplier effect on SNAP Fecal, which we are very comfortable with a mid-2018 launch. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's helpful color. And then just thinking about the operating expense budget forecasted for 2018, over the last couple of years, you've made some pretty targeted investments in the U.S. commercial infrastructure; and just wanted to get a sense of how we should be thinking about the sales force potentially being further expanded in light of these new innovations that are coming to the market? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you. I think that's a great question. We're very pleased with the expansion that we put in place and really had the bulk of the costs in Q3 already embedded in the P&L. And as I mentioned, now they're go through that one quarter of transition that's associated with territory changes and rep changes, which positions us very well, not only for Q4, for 2018. We're at 435 \u2013 that's field-based sales professionals, sales and support professionals. I think we're really in a great position \u2013 that is the largest and deepest sales organization in the companion animal market across all of companies, including pharma. And I think we're in a good place for that. I think 2018 will be an opportunity to leverage our investments both, of course, not only in people but also IT that supports that. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Going back to our Investor Day guidance though, for 2018, the margin improvement that we're signaling will be more gross margin driven. So we are going to have some carryover impacts from the investments. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's great. If I can just squeeze one more in on the tax rate for 2018. It does seem, even if you strip out some of the noise this year, maybe a little bit higher than the Street was modeling. Remind us, maybe is it just mix factors in terms of the U.S. growing so strongly? But just any thoughts on kind of what the longer-term tax rate we should be thinking about in 2018 and beyond? Thanks. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: It actually is the same underlying tax rate of 32% before our estimates for the share-based compensation activity. So I'm not sure how the external views were factoring that in, but that's effectively what it is, it's the 32% before the benefit of the $13 million to $16 million that we signaled. Nicholas M. Jansen - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks for all the color, as always. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thanks, Nick. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. And I appreciate a lot of commentary on the call. I guess I wanted to just follow-up on the instrument dynamic in the quarter. Obviously, you called out changes in program mix. I think some of us are still trying to understand the economic value index, my understanding is that one of the areas of that is to promote competitive Catalyst placements. That number was pretty good in the quarter. So I guess I'm really trying to get to the bottom of what constituted the expanded bundling in the quarter that really contributed to the bulk of the change in program mix. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. Just thank you for that observation, I'll let Brian answer on the accounting, which is complex, and of course will even change next year. But we're very pleased with the 19% growth in competitive and greenfield Catalyst placements that we had globally and the 14% overall growth in Catalyst placements. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, we saw relatively more cross CAG placements, which I think reflect actually the focus of the sales organization. It was relatively more than we had projected, but it's bundling of SediVues and lab deals with competitive Catalyst placements relative of single placements that may be associated with something like a rebate program. So, it was a relative change in mix that at the end of the day is very positive for the long-term growth of the company and the company's revenues and the recurring revenue base, but does have an effect just in terms of the current accounting that we don't recognize that upfront, and so that was... Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: But over the life of the contract, five years, six years. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Got it. And I might have missed it. But, do you envision the possibility of getting back to double-digit growth in instruments for 2018? Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: It's early for us to get in... Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Are you talking about in revenues? Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: For CAG instrument revenue? Yeah. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: It's too early for us to be getting down into the modality views. But, I think what we've signaled in the past that it's more about sustaining high levels of instrument placements and that the bigger driver of our growth is going to be growth in the recurring. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. The primary purpose of instrument placements is to drive the very profitable recurring revenue up. That's not only instrument consumables, but of course can apply also to reference labs and rapid assay, all the components of the CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue. So instruments is a means towards an end, and that end is profitable recurring revenue, which, as you know, is close to three-quarters of the total company's revenue. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Excellent. If I can sneak this one in. Jon, you talked about new opportunities in artificial intelligence and Big Data opportunities. Can you speak if that is something that would tie into some of the capabilities you've already built at IDEXX or is this something that you're working on that would provide a completely new, maybe a new architecture or ecosystem? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, no. I think one of the benefits of the ecosystem \u2013 the answer is the former; it will enhance and leverage the ecosystem that we already have. It allows us to do exceptional work in retrospective analysis, which advances medical insight, it allows our reps to be more productive. There is a lot of multiplier effect and it's been a focus of our R&D and other folks. And I think you saw some of that at the Analyst Day, when we talked about the number of clinical visits that has a chemistry panel is only 13%, which is pretty low. And by the way, it's higher for our customers than it is for the market as a whole, but still the opportunity to grow the standard of care by helping customers appreciate where they stand versus their peers, we think could be a long-term growth driver. That's just one of the many examples that the AI and Big Data. Another example is just the Neural Network 3.0 that we're going to launch in January I mentioned earlier, Mark, on SediVue, we continue to see advancements inside of our products. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line David Westenberg with C.L. King. Your line is open. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks so much. So not to belabor the instrument number, I know that's been too much maybe of a focus of this call, but I have noticed that instrument revenues have \u2013 they've missed me for three quarters and year-over-year has been challenging for the last, let's say two quarters. So has this mix been actually something that you've seen for a couple quarters and maybe are just calling out now or is this maybe a mix that you've seen a little bit more in focus this particular quarter and something that you're calling out now because it's something that we should definitely be aware of on a go forward basis? Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I'd say relative to our goals, we've been performing very well in terms of instrument placement. So just to reinforce, the premium analyzer growth was 6% in the quarter, it was up 13% when you adjust for the prior year backlog orders and we've grown our Catalyst base globally 21% year-on-year. So, we feel very good how we're doing on instrument placements. In terms of the mix and how that flows through our accounting. We've seen relatively more bundle placements that result in deferred instrument revenues and we're adjusting that in this year's number, and in total that's a $5 million revenue number for this year, which under new accounting going forward will be less of an impact. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And just a reminder on that question, because, David, I know, there's lot of moving parts on revenue recognition. We introduced a very successful new program in Japan actually, and it really helped accelerate very attractive economic value placements, but it moved from upfront revenue recognition of the historical way we placed programs, to in this 2017 revenue accounting world, to a deferred recognition. So, that was one of the factors, really something where we \u2013 that was new (01:00:25). Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Just don't want to lose sight of that supported the over 1,000 placements of international Catalysts in the quarter. So we're doing great on placing instruments and the mix is a little different, and we're trying to reflect that in the estimates. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. That was a 35% growth in Catalyst placements internationally in Q3. Pretty attractive. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Yeah, definitely. You guys have definitely beat me on the instrument placement numbers by quite a lot. So actually can you talk about maybe on the utilization, on the Catalyst as we move internationally, just for sake of our models, how should we look at Catalyst utilization on the per as you become, as Catalyst moves more and more as a percent of your installed base outside the U.S.? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. So, I'd say that's an excellent question. As we've talked about in the past, the typical utilization of a Catalyst placement outside the U.S. is going to be less than the utilization of a Catalyst placement inside the U.S. On the other hand, while we make a big deal about the new and competitive, when we upgrade VetTests outside the U.S., we usually see a larger bump than we would have historically seen in the U.S. We're not upgrading too many VetTests in the U.S. anymore because there aren't many left. But there are VetTest upgrade opportunities, most of the Catalyst placements that are not new competitive internationally are VetTest upgrades and they support the very strong recurring revenue growth that we've seen. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: We've seen nice uplift on the international average utilization as we're upgrading. So, it's been definitely supporting our outlook. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Upgrade from VetTest to Catalyst. So that's a favorable dynamic internationally. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: That's a couple of questions. And I'll take a couple more offline, so I'm just going to do one more for sake of time. So, on the reference lab, your primary competitor has now been fully incorporated into a larger private company. Can you talk about changes that you've seen competitively, not necessarily in terms of competitive wins and losses, but just in terms of shift in the way that they're marketing or maybe going against you, or any sort of color on competitive dynamics as this integration takes place or has taken place? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: The thing I would say there, it really \u2013 there remains a very competitive market. It has been a competitive market, I expect it will be a competitive market, but I think one of the interesting things that we've seen in the U.S. market for IDEXX is, we're getting double-digit volume growth in same customers' volume. That is volume growth, that's being driven by things like the Fecal antigen test and by SDMA and that is, along with price and net new customer wins, but double-digit, over 10% growth in same-store volume is helping us with very favorable reference lab growth in the U.S. market. So I don't see really any change in the competitive environment. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Thanks for the questions. I'll take the rest offline. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Ben Haynor with Aegis Capital. Your line is open. Benjamin Haynor - Aegis Capital Corp.: Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the questions. First off for me on the bundled rental programs that you've seen success with in the emerging markets and now it sounds like starting to see some success in Japan. Is there a plan to expand those into more of the developed world or how do you see those programs evolving over time? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. I don't \u2013 I think we always look at what is the most favorable scenario where we can place instruments with very profitable economic value and sometimes it's an upfront placement where we recognize revenue, and sometimes it's another placement. And what's going to confuse everything is in 2018, the revenue standards change, as Brian took you through in the prepared comments. But we are always keeping an eye on the economics of these placements. And we believe that creates long-term shareholder value and we really aren't as concerned about the revenue recognition, that's accounting, it's important that we do that correctly, but what creates value is the net present value of the placement over a five year to seven year period of time Benjamin Haynor - Aegis Capital Corp.: Okay. That's helpful. That makes sense. And then lastly for me, is the shift amongst the deal types that you've seen in your view more of a function of increased promotion of certain types of deals by your sales force or is it a function of shifts in the preferences of veterinary practices? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. I think what happens is sometimes practices respond to one type of \u2013 they're not particularly \u2013 I mean I don't think they took managerial accounting in vet school. And so, sometimes one type of program just appeals them more than another, it works for them, but it also works for us. The economic value of these programs isn't very different by one type or another and isn't different by those that that we recognize revenue on upfront and those that we recognize revenue for the instrument placement over time. It's just not different, but sometimes we'll see trends on how customers respond. And our job is to place instruments in customers in an economically attractive fashion. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I do think the growth in cross CAG deals aligns with the connectivity that we are bringing to vet practices and the value that they see in having a full set of solutions from IDEXX. So, that's very much (01:06:27). Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: That's an excellent point, Brian. We're not just talking about placements of instruments, of course we're growing the reference lab business. SDMA really merges the two. We had SDMA in the reference labs, now customers say, well I also run my chemistry in-house, I want SDMA on the in-house. So, really is \u2013 we call it one business the CAG diagnostics with different modalities, modes of delivering that value. And we're continuing to see growth in the percentage of customers who use both in-house and reference lab as \u2013 with the base being those who use one or the other or both, we're continuing to see growth in that cross-selling that we've talked about in past investor meetings. And yet we've still got \u2013 we're still below 50%. So we've got a lot of runway to go there. Benjamin Haynor - Aegis Capital Corp.: Okay. That's all I had. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Okay. With that, we will conclude the call. We appreciate everybody's attention and we look forward to reporting our year-end results in January. Operator : Thank you. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: With that, I'll conclude the call and huge thanks to all of our employees who have worked very hard to deliver these results and to deliver exceptional value for our customers. It's interesting, our customers actually grow faster than the market as a whole. And I think that's the result of the great work on innovation and commercial efforts that we have around the world. So with that we'll conclude the call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference Service. You may now disconnect.",

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the investor relations section of our website. In reviewing our fourth quarter 2017 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth, constant currency growth, and comparable constant currency growth referred to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2016, unless otherwise noted. In order to allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit his or her questions to one, with one follow-up if necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we'll take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian P. McKeon: Thank you and good morning everyone. I am pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results and provide an update on our financial outlook for 2018. We had excellent results in Q4 which concluded another year of outstanding financial performance for IDEXX. We achieved 12% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter supported by 13% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and 15% growth in premium instrument placements. Overall reported revenue increased 14%, aided by favorable year-on-year changes in FX rates. Our strong finish to 2017 supported achievement of full year organic revenue growth of 10.4% consistent with our long-term financial goals. Results were driven by accelerated 13% organic gains and CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues reflecting strong double-digit growth in U.S. and international markets. Our full year EPS was $2.94 net of a non-recurring $0.34 per share charge related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform. Adjusted for this factor, full year EPS was $3.28, $0.02 per share above the high end of our guidance range. This performance reflected strong top line growth and achievement of full year operating margins of 21%, a 140 basis point improvement year-on-year on a constant currency basis. EPS grew 21% on a comparable constant currency basis in 2017 above our long-term financial goal range for the second consecutive year. We're well positioned to build on these results in 2018 reflected in our updated outlook for 9.5% to 11.5% organic revenue growth which now includes an estimated $10 million year-on-year benefit from revenue accounting standard changes. We're also maintaining a consistent outlook for 75 to 125 basis points improvement in constant currency operating margins while investing 10 million in incremental operating expense leveraging benefits from U.S. tax reform. Overall strong operating trends, favorable FX rate changes, revenue upside from accounting changes, and significant projected benefits from U.S. tax reform support a $65 million increase to our 2018 preliminary revenue guidance to $2,205 million to $2,245 million and a $0.55 per share increase to the midpoint of our EPS guidance to $4.04 to $4.18 per share.  We'll provide an update on our 2018 guidance later in the call. Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results beginning with an overview of performance by segment and region. Q4 performance was led by continued strong momentum in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were 434 million up 12% organically supported by 13% organic gains in recurring CAG Diagnostic revenues and in our veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging businesses. For the full year, CAG revenues increased 11% organically to 1.7 billion driven by accelerated 13% organic gains in recurring CAG Diagnostic revenues. Livestock, poultry, and dairy revenue of 37 million increased 8% organically in Q4 ahead of our expectations. Results reflected higher than projected year-end government program and distributor ordering and solid gains in recurring revenues supported by growth of our pregnancy platform. These gains were moderated by continued pressure on dairy and swine markets in China which have constrained emerging market gains. For the full year, our LPD revenues were 128 million reflecting relatively flat organic growth. For 2018, we're planning for flat to modest organic growth in LPD [ph] overall consistent with recent underlying growth trends.  Our water business revenues grew 16% organically in the fourth quarter to 29 million aided by favorable comparisons to prior year channel inventory adjustments in advance of our go-direct initiative in Brazil. Adjusted for these changes, we estimate Q4 water organic revenue growth was about 9%. For the full year, water business revenues increased to 114 million, up 10% organically including about 3 percentage points of growth benefit from go-direct initiatives. We're very pleased with our momentum in the water business and believe we're on track for continued high-single digit organic revenue gains in this highly profitable business in 2018. By region, U.S. revenues were 298 million in the quarter, up 11% organically. Gains were driven by strong 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, despite a 1% headwind from fewer equivalent days. U.S. recurring revenue gains were supported by continued strong double-digit growth in reference labs and consumables and high-single-digit growth in rapid assay sales. U.S. CAG recurring diagnostic price gains continued to trend in the 2% to 3% range with the bulk of our growth driven by volume. IDEXX's performance continues to significantly outpace solid U.S. veterinary practice market growth reflected in our dataset from about 5,200 clinics. In Q4, patient visits increased 2.0% and clinic revenues increased 6.1% compared to the prior-year period. For the full year U.S. revenues reached 1,204 million up 10% organically driven primarily by our U.S. CAG business, which represents nearly 94% of total U.S. revenues. We achieved U.S. CAG organic growth of 10% in 2017, supported by accelerated 12% organic CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains. International revenues in Q4 were 208 million up 13% organically. International results were driven by 14% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting continued strong consumable gains supported by our expanding Catalyst instrument base. International revenues reached 766 million for the full year or 39% of total IDEXX revenues supported by organic gains of 11%. International CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 14% organically for the full year, reflecting double-digit growth across Europe, Asia Pacific, and Latin American regions. Overall, international revenue gains were moderated by flat organic growth in our international LPD business. In terms of segment performance, our Q4 results were supported by accelerating expansion of our premium instrument base and continued strong global gains across CAG Diagnostic testing modalities. Globally, we placed a record 3,650 premium analyzers in Q4, up 15% compared to prior year levels driven by a 25% year-on-year increase in Catalyst placements and record SediVue results. Q4 results included 1,863 Catalyst placements. This performance reflected 1,300 placements in international markets of 34% year-on-year and 433 placements to new and competitive counts in North America, a 25% increase over strong prior year levels. Consistent with our strategic focus, 77% of North American Catalyst placements were at new or competitive accounts in the quarter. In the quarter, we also placed 1,040 premium hematology instruments globally, 747 SediVues and 1,630 SNAP Pros bringing year-to-date SediVue placements to 2,267 and year-to-date SNAP Pro placements to nearly 6000. Instrument revenues in Q4 were 37 million, up 2% organically as very strong placement gains offset deferred revenue impacts under 2017 GAAP accounting standards. Our EVI metric in the U.S. was up significantly in the quarter reflecting very strong gains in competitive Catalysts and SediVue placements consistent with our strategy. For the full year IDEXX made substantial progress in growing our global premium install base. We now have 29,855 Catalysts installed globally, the growth of 22% year-on-year. These gains reflect 37% year-on-year installed base growth in international markets and 10% gains in North America driven by 1,369 placements in new and competitive accounts, a 14% year-on-year increase in North America. International Catalyst placements reached 3,839 this year up 19% and on track with our long-term expansion goals. Growth in our instrument customer base supported by sustained high retention levels and augmented by continued seller utilization gains to grow continued strong momentum in consumable revenues. Instrument consumer revenues of 134 million grew 14% organically in Q4 supported by robust gains across U.S. and international markets. Our SediVue installed base continues to expand and contributed 2% to consumable growth in the quarter. Reference laboratory and consulting services with revenue of 162 million also grew 12% organically in the fourth quarter net of the 1% equivalent day headwind. Continued high Reference Lab gains were supported by strong double-digit organic revenue growth in the U.S. reflecting double-digit organic volume gains with existing customers augmented by solid price realization and net customer additions. International Reference Lab gains were solid in the quarter with organic growth at high single-digit rates driven by consistent gains in Europe. Rapid assay revenues continued to trend very well. Q4 revenues of 46 million grew 10% organically benefiting by about 1% net due to favorable international distributor inventory changes offset by fewer equivalent days. Rapid assay gains continued to reflect solid volume growth in 4Dx and specialty test and continued progress we're gaining share in first generation products in the U.S. Veterinary Software Services and Diagnostic Imaging System revenues were 37 million in the quarter up 13% organically driven by increased penetration of recurring services in our cornerstone installed base and very strong growth in digital radiography placements which were up 24% year-on-year in the quarter.  Turning to the P&L gross profit was 272 million in Q4 or 53.8% of revenues up 13% on a reported basis. Adjusting for foreign exchange impacts gross margins decreased 30 basis points. Continued solid net price and productivity gains were offset by stepped up investments in lab capacity in operations, approximately 1 million of IT related costs reclassifications from operating expense to cost of goods sold, relatively higher year-on-year LPD and water costs, and relatively lower average instrument margins reflecting strong international growth. Certainly these impacts were specific to the quarter and we're targeting continued solid gross margin expansion 2018. Foreign exchange hedge impacts reported gross profit reflected a $1 million loss in Q4 related to the weakening of the U.S. dollar limiting year-on-year net FX gains to about $0.02 per share in the quarter.  Operating profit in Q4 was 98 million up 17% as reported or 14% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit results benefited from strong revenue gains in operating expense leverage supporting a 40 basis point improvement in constant currency operating margins in the quarter. Operating expenses in Q4 were up 11% as reported or 10% on a constant currency basis driven by investments in sales and marketing resources and enabling information technology. For the full year operating profit was 413 million, this reflects an operating margin of 21% or an increase of 140 basis points on a constant currency basis in 2017. This outstanding full year result reflects about 100 basis points of constant currency gross margin gains and 40 basis points of benefits from operating expense leverage benefiting from our accelerated revenue growth. EPS in Q4 was $0.43 per share including a 31 million or $0.34 per share non-recurring charge related to the implementation of U.S. tax reform, $0.06 per share in benefit from a share based compensation accounting adoption, and less than $0.01 in discrete tax benefit from the expected utilization of foreign tax credits. The $31 million tax reform related charges are current estimates and relates to the deemed repatriation of the company's foreign profits net of deferred tax remeasurement at lower corporate tax rates and other related adjustments. The charge came in below earlier estimates reflecting favorable clarification of specific factors related to deemed repatriation tax impacts for IDEXX. For 2017 EPS was $2.94. Adjusted to exclude the onetime tax reform impact EPS was $3.28 per share. For the full year foreign exchange rate changes increased revenue growth by 0.3% and reduced EPS by $0.01 per share including FX hedge loss impacts of about $4 million. For the full year adoption of a share based compensation accounting guidance provided 28 million or $0.30 per share and benefit. Discrete tax benefits also contributed $0.04 per share benefit in 2017. Adjusting for these factors 2017 EPS growth was 21% on a comparable constant currency basis. Free cash flow was 299 million for 2017, this represents free cash flow at 114% of net income or 102% adjusting for the U.S. tax reform charge that includes deemed repatriation taxes required to be paid over eight years. This performance was delivered while supporting 76 million in annual capital investment. Our strong cash flows and continued positive business momentum supported the allocation of 270 million in capital towards share repurchases for the full year including repurchases of 350,000 shares in Q4 for $55 million. This brought our 2017 repurchase levels to nearly 1.75 million shares at an average price of $155 per share.  Of note over the last five years we deployed just under $2 billion to repurchase 28 million shares or more than 25% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the period for an average price of $70 per share significantly enhancing per share returns for IDEXX shareholders. Our balance sheet is in a very strong position, we ended the year with 1,266 million in debt outstanding including 606 million in fixed rate term debt and 655 million outstanding under our $850 million revolving credit facility. At year-end we had 472 million in cash and investment balances of which 99% was held internationally. Our leverage ratios at year-end is a multiple of EBITDA where 2.4 times gross and 1.5 times net of cash investment balances. Turning towards 2018 outlook our growth momentum and disciplined operating performance positions as well to deliver continued strong financial results in 2018 aided by substantial projected benefits from U.S. tax reform. As noted we're raising our 2018 organic revenue growth outlook to 9.5% to 11.5% gains incorporating an estimated $10 million or 0.5% growth benefit from revenue recognition accounting changes. Our outlook is supported by expectations for continued high levels of premium instrument placements and 12% to 14% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues including about 1% of growth benefit to CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues in 2018 for retroactive revenue accounting standards change impacts. Overall we are raising our reported revenue outlook by 65 million at midpoint to 2,205 million to 2,245 million or reported growth of 12% to 14%. This increase reflects strong operating trends including the flow through of higher than expected 2017 performance. The projected 10 million accounting change benefit and about 35 million of additional benefit from updated rate assumptions for foreign exchange which are reflected in our press release. At the new FX rates we project that our reported revenue growth will be increased by 2% to 2.5% in 2018 related to year-on-year weakening of the U.S. dollar. We're raising our 2018 EPS outlook to $4.04 to $4.18, an increase of $0.55 per share reflecting about $0.06 in upside from strong operating trends, $0.10 of additional EPS related to our updated FX estimates, and an estimated $0.39 per share in net benefits related to U.S. tax reform.  The EPS outlook reflects consistent goals for year-on-year constant currency operating margin improvement of 75 to 125 basis points. We have maintained this outlook while incorporating 10 million of additional operating expense investment and about 5 million of incremental capital investment in 2018 leveraging benefits from U.S. tax reform. This outlook results in comparable constant currency EPS growth of 28% to 33% including an estimated 13% of net EPS growth benefit related to U.S. tax reform. Our outlook for our effective tax rate in 2018 is now 20% to 21% including an estimated 11 million or 147 million, excuse me, including 11 million to 14 million or about 3% in projected tax rate benefit from exercise of stock based compensation. This outlook reflects projected recurring tax rate benefits to the newest -- the new U.S. corporate tax structure primarily driven by the reduction in the U.S. statutory rate from 35% to 21% net of certain offsets. Our updated outlook for share count in 2018 is for reduction in average shares outstanding from continued stock repurchases of 1% to 1.5% which assumes that we maintain net leverage at approximately 1.5 times EBITDA. Under U.S. tax reform we will have increased flexibility related to global management of cash and debt balances. Our 2018 projections reflect an assumed optimization of our global net interest costs utilizing excess cash balances over time resulting in an outlook for net interest expense of 35 million to 36 million. Free cash flow was projected at 80% to 85% of net income for 2018 including approximately 15% of free cash flow impact driven by 50 million of combined incremental capital spending related to our Westbrook, Maine headquarters expansion and our German core lab relocation and expansion as well as about $5 million of incremental growth capital investment supported by additional cash flows associated with the U.S. tax reform. Incorporating these estimates our 2018 free cash flow outlook reflects projected capital spending of approximately 140 million. Foreign exchange rates will be a positive factor impacting 2018 profit results at the updated exchange rates outlined in our press release. At these rates we estimate that foreign exchange rate changes will increase reported EPS by approximately $0.12 per share net of $7 million in currently projected hedge losses. In terms of our first quarter outlook in 2018 we expect Q1 reported revenue growth in the 13% to 14.5% range reflecting organic gains of 9.5% to 10.5% net of a 1% equivalent to a headwind. Reported Q1 revenue results will benefit by approximately 3.5% to 4% from favorable year-on-year FX impacts at the rates assumed in our press release.  Q1 operating margins are expected to be flat to modestly higher than prior year levels reflecting near-term moderating impacts from Reference Lab growth capacity investments and relatively higher levels of operating expense growth as we lap incremental commercial investment advance in the second half of 2017. We expect our effective tax rate in Q1 to be 15.5% to 16.5% including projected benefits from share based compensation, exercise activity which is typically higher in the first quarter. That concludes the financial overview, let me turn the call over to Jon for his comments on our business performance and our areas of focus heading into 2018. Jonathan W. Ayers: Thank you, Brian. We had a very strong finish to the year across our businesses and around the globe. I'm very pleased with our team's success in 2017 in growing the market for IDEXX's innovative diagnostics and software solutions including for the companion animal market resulting in over 10% organic revenue growth and EPS gains at the high end of our long-term financial goals. Our North American commercial team saw accelerated successes at high value instrument placements, a key driver to the profitable recurring revenues of instrument consumables while at the same time growing both our Reference Lab Diagnostic modality, the largest contributor to North American recurring revenue and our Rapid assay line.  As investors recall we undertook a 12% expansion in our U.S. field organization fully in place in Q3 but still early in the learning curve. In Q4 we saw this expansion kick into gear. We also resumed the double-digit productivity in our EVI growth in instrument placements per rep that we achieved in the first half of the year and the combination of the expansion in the number of reps and the productivity per rep in North America grow our 25% growth in Catalyst placements to new and competitive accounts and 23% growth in SediVue placements. Along with these results we saw sustained high levels of customer retention which are world class levels. Our 98% retention of in-house chemistry accounts in U.S. compares favorably to any period since we announced our intention to go fully direct in 2014.  Our U.S. Reference Lab revenue growth in the fourth quarter sustained mid teen range even with a 1% headwind related to equivalent days. North American growth continues to benefit from strong same store sales growth as customers appreciate and adopt our unique offerings including fecal antigen, SDMA, molecular diagnostics, and we saw increasing customer retention levels reaching 97% from the Reference Lab modality. These results are driven by our deep sales coverage and strengthening customer relationships that come over time combined with an expanding diagnostic offering that is unique as well as new tools and technologies that help customers adopt and grow preventive care testing protocols. This volume led growth in our Reference Labs helps us assure our long-term margin expansion growth goals in the lab operation.  Our Companion Animal Group international operations completed a year with exceptional performance in placements of instruments led by Catalyst, our instrument platform with the strongest generation of recurring consumable revenues. Premium instrument placements growth of 24% to almost 25% in the high value Catalyst placements growth was 34% resulting in full year Catalyst placements of 3,839 and a 37% expansion in our international Catalyst installed base. Results were strong in virtually every country of every geography Europe, Japan, China, Australia, New Zealand, and Latin America. Our move to a direct sales structure in most countries in each of these regions over time has proven to be highly successful and our teams around the world are applying their entrepreneurial spirit to bringing Catalyst and the rest of the IDEXX lab offering to countries in a way that inspires veterinarians to adopt this advanced technology in accordance with local market needs.  I was also very pleased with the waters continued growth and profitability and the rebound in the growth of livestock, poultry, and dairy or LPD from Q3 levels. No water benefit this year from go-direct initiatives that set the stage for sustained long-term growth in this business. While LPD leveraged the benefits of new innovations like our pregnancy testing platform to offset broader market headwinds constraining overall growth gains in 2017. These are exceptional businesses represented by IDEXX professionals around the world that are committed to our purpose.  The key innovation accomplishment for Q4 was the on-time launch of Catalyst SDMA. In adding this remarkable assay to our in-house Catalyst solution we are greatly expanding access to SDMA and the availability of estimate providing expanded pet care. As Brian mentioned we have close to 30,000 Catalysts instruments in customers around the world and these Catalyst customers have been anxiously awaiting for the availability of this slide as evidenced by the over 3,500 unique practices in North America that have already bought the test since our pre-launch and 60 days ago and are beginning shipping just a couple weeks ago. Many of our Catalyst customers do not have access to our Reference Labs for a variety of reasons and others are committed to running their chemistry real-time in the practice. We call this real-time care or the practice of running the panel immediately on the in-house lab during the exam and providing care at that moment in time. We're also looking to build a clinical appreciation of SDMA with veterinary schools which is facilitated by Catalysts SDMA since these institutions typically run lab work on their premise and now can do so with Catalyst. We find that the more customers gain experience with SDMA in a clinical setting where it can make the difference in the health of their patients, the faster they realize how essential this new parameter is in routine chemistry testing including a sick animal, disease monitoring, and preventive care protocols. Catalyst SDMA would celebrate this learning and market adoption and once customers conclude that SDMA is critically important then they become highly loyal to IDEXX for their diagnostic needs. Our SediVue results were also amazing in Q4 bringing 2017 total placements to well over our 2000 of 2,267 units. This month we're rolling out our next generation algorithmic software to the entire customer base called Neural Network 3.0. This version has the benefit of images from a million patients and uses machine learning to add quantification to red and white blood cells, advance to detection of certain bacteria as you can imagine bacteria is an essential urine parameter, and also bring other enhancements to the image algorithm. The instruments growing capabilities that come from having over 3,800 systems in the field it's achievable through our 10 years of experience with smart service or the Internet things which means that the unique IDEXX innovation for in-house lab equipment. Every pet sample run on SediVue improves SediVue for all future patients and this is the impact of smart service and machine learning. We also remain on track for the launch of SNAP Fecal Dx in the summer of 2018, our biggest SNAP launch in 15 years. SNAP Fecal will launch our ever growing installed base of SNAP Pro customers and our success with fecal antigen at the Reference Labs. As a result of the great success in SNAP Pro placements in 2017 we have an installed base of over 17,000 instruments in almost 10,000 practices in the U.S. alone with continued momentum in 2018. The volume of SNAP 4Dx in the U.S. market that comes from SNAP Pro customers easily exceeds 50% of our U.S. 4Dx volume up significantly from where we were when we went direct in early 2015.  SNAP Pro penetration combined with strong field presence, a powerful online marketing channel and demonstrated clinical accuracy of our SNAP technology sets the stage for continued solid expansion in our Rapid assay franchise. The strength of our business performance reflects the attractiveness of our recurring revenue business model around the world which achieved accelerated 13% organic growth in CAG recurring revenues in 2017. We have consistently focused on aggressively allocating capital to grow our businesses organically. The attractiveness of investing in growth in our franchise will be further enhanced by U.S. tax reform.  Simply put tax reform is huge for IDEXX as it is for our U.S. customers who are generally small businesses. And anything that helps our customers become more successful economically also helps IDEXX and tax reform gives our customers greater resources to invest in IDEXX's advance innovations be they diagnostic, digital radiography where we had a breakout in Q4, software or staff education. All these areas support practiced growth and the acceleration of their partnership with and utilization of IDEXX through the benefit of the owners and their pets. As a result of tax reform we are accelerating our investment in software, data, and related innovation. We are the innovative leader in veterinary software with nearly 39,000 VetConnect PLUS accounts, 22,000 of which we call active monthly users, 9,000 customers for our practice management solutions and over 5,000 customers for our cloud based apps that add value to the customers practice management software.  Our data capabilities have already generated groundbreaking insights in medicine using a data driven evidence based approach. And in 2018 we aim to use data to help our customers appreciate how to grow their protocols with the appropriate use of diagnostics to better meet the needs of today's pet owner. Importantly we will be able to show how any particular IDEXX customer benchmarks in relation to their peers and colleagues and other practice locations in diagnostic utilization. We're also using some of the benefits of U.S. tax reform to expand the company's financial math we provide the U.S. -- two U.S. employees who save for retirement using IDEXX 401K plan. This expansion to a dollar for dollar match of 5% of salary or up to 5% of salary will help our U.S. employees better provide for their retirement in a highly tax efficient fashion. Retirement planning is a societal challenge and we are further supporting our employees with this expanded benefit.  Tax reform supports investments towards our purpose and our long-term growth strategy. The return on investments that we've made in past years in the U.S. market starting with our sales force reconfiguration and then decision to go fully direct and then estimates we continue to make as we grow the topline will increase on an after tax basis. Prior to 2018 our pretax dollar of U.S. return generated $0.65 after federal tax and in 2018 this same dollar generated $0.79 after federal tax, a growth of 21% all other things being equal. This gives us confidence to continue to grow our investments in this incredibly attractive market. We are able to do that and still meet the company wide margin expansion goals that Brian reinforced earlier in the call driven in part by 2018 operational efficiencies resulting from our accomplishments in 2017 and prior years. All of us remained dedicated to our purpose, to create exceptional long-term value for our customers, employees, and shareholders by enhancing the health and well being of pets, people, and livestock. So with that we will open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll go to the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Please go ahead. Nick Hiller : Good morning, this Nick Hiller in for Ryan Daniels, thanks for taking my questions. I was just wondering if you could give a bit of an update on the SNAP Fecal Dx launch specifically when would produce of that product begin, and how much interest is there in that products specifically outside of the core IDEXX customer base especially given how prevalent fecal tests are and how unique the offering will be? And just a follow-up on assays, any thoughts on the potential competitive launch of a Rapid assay to compete against 4Dx? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers: We're very excited about the SNAP Fecal launch which we expect in the summer of 2018. I think as you referenced fecal testing is a routine preventative care protocol for dogs, usually done with the annual or semiannual exam. The vast majority of those are run in-house today using manual methods in the microscope and so we see this as an opportunity to replace that in-house manual method with using biotechnology and ELISA method. So, our rough estimate is around 40 million fecal tests are run in North America annually. And a large majority of that is run in house although we're also very successful in driving fecal testing in the Reference Lab with our fecal antigen offering. And so, like anything the penetration and adoption of any product takes time, but we think this is going to be a long-term grower. I\u2019ll just noted I was really excited about the rapid pick up with SDMA on slide with over 25% of catalyst customers buying in the first couple months. We think it is an amazing start up, but I think Fecal will be a major -- the in house fecal leveraging the Reference Lab fecal antigen technology will be a major franchise for us.  We remain excited about strong franchise we have with vector borne disease screening. We believe the announcement to which you refer validates that customers really need multiplexing a comprehensive disease screening, which has been our strategy from the beginning and what we've been doing in that business is turning it into a razorblade business model by adding a SNAP Pro which not only interprets the result but automatically runs a result, connects it to our ecosystem, captures the charge, and adds it to the medical record. And at this point, easily over 50% of our U.S. volume is running on SNAP Pro and that will continue to grow as we continue to replace SNAP Pro we placed over almost 6000 of them last year. We also have a really unique accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity that has been validated by third party technology and I think that is unique to our SNAP ELISA platform. And so I think we remain excited. This is a business though that is still under penetrated and not enough customers are running 4Dx or vector-borne disease screening as part of preventative care protocols on their dogs. And so while we had very strong high single-digit growth in 2017 and we've launched -- regionally launched actually vector-borne disease screening over 15 years ago, we see continued growth in this market in 2018 and beyond and that's a growth that we expect to continue to drive. Operator : Thank you, we will go to the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Michael Ryskin : Hey thanks, it is actually Mike Ryskin on for Derik. Congrats on the quarter guys. Want to touch on a couple quick points, the instrument growth in the quarter, it's nice to see they have returned to positive growth but just want to confirm the difference between the instrument revenue growth and the placements, is that along the lines that we saw in previous quarters of the revenue recognition that we talked about in 3Q or is there something going on with pricing there? And then also I have a follow-up on the margins, saw that you reiterated that targets for 2018 of the constant currency op margin growth, but still saw some choppiness in gross margins this quarter, can you talk about some of the gives and takes there and what your expectations are on the gross margin line for 2018? Brian P. McKeon: Sure, why don\u2019t I take those on instruments, that's correct. We did have some deferred revenue impacts, very, very strong growth as noted, and under current accounting we had deferrals which under the new accounting will be a new set of rules and we won't have that same dynamic. Moving forward, they will be different pieces moving forward, but net-net I think that's more reflective of the current GAAP standards and we work through that. Michael Ryskin : And that's starting in 1Q? Brian P. McKeon: Yes, we'll break that out for you. It's going to be complicated, it will be very, very detailed disclosures because you have a restatement -- modified restatement of prior year balance sheet information and then obviously the new accounting, try to highlight that net we now estimate that overall that's going to be a plus 10 million impact for IDEXX. It will from a growth rate point of view which is actually going to help us on the recurring CAG and we highlighted that was about a point of growth rate impact and that's more related to the restatement of balance sheet the prior year aspect, and on the instruments well basically new accounting gets you to more upfront revenue recognition, but there again will be some restatement impact that will be a slight headwind, so we will clarify that all for you. Jonathan W. Ayers: I think just to get back to your -- the fundamental essence of your question, these remain the pricing, it's not a factor. These are economically very successful placements and are really no different than prior quarters in that regard, and so I think the unit placement numbers particularly in the U.S. to new and competitive accounts and of course internationally we're placing to both new competitive and upgrading a VetTest which is a good -- which also contributes to recurring revenue growth. These are very high quality placements. Brian P. McKeon: And also of note, the EVI metric we noted was up significantly, that's a measure of value and we'll be rolling that out to international markets in 2018 to reinforce that. On your question of gross margins, a couple of themes here, our Reference Lab business in the U.S. is growing very quickly and with accelerating growth momentum and we made decisions to add routes basically, add capacity to support the growth that we see coming, make sure that we are fully staffed, we're doing a better job on retention of our lab employees. And the net of that is it is extremely healthy business. We actually delivered close to 100 basis points of constant currency margin improvements in our lab businesses here while supporting those investments, so in the near-term, that has some moderating impacts on gross margins but we will quickly grow into that. Michael Ryskin : And then also knew this quarter was -- the fourth quarter was the reclassification of million\u2026? Brian P. McKeon: Yeah included in that too was our laboratory information management systems. We're recording those costs that previously the amortization was recorded in the OPEX and we're moving that to cost of goods sold. So no net profit impact but it has a moderating impact from margins. We also had another factor that was more specific to the quarter in our LPD and water businesses. We were comparing to a prior year Q4 number that had favorability related to basically inventory dynamics, accelerated production growth and higher levels of absorption. That's not something we anticipate carrying forward so the outlook that we have for operating margin growth next year we reinforce the 75 to 125 basis point improvement that will be driven by gross margin gains. So we feel good about that and I'd also note that that covers the 10 million of incremental investment that Jon highlighted so the underlying growth is really about 50 bips stronger than that. Jonathan W. Ayers: And that 75 to 125 basis point margin improvement is off of the higher revenue which as Brian referenced was FX related, was accounting related, and was flow through of the revenue over delivery so higher growth. But none of those things are changing our 75 to 125 basis point incremental margin on that higher level. So there are some fundamental goodness there. Michael Ryskin : Got it, that's all really helpful, thanks guys. Operator : We will go to the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Erin Wright : Hey, thanks. I notice there is a nice uplift in Rapid assay, I guess let's all try the amount [ph], I guess how much of it was price and it continues to be a competitive market there, do you think that growth rate is sustainable or what is your overall growth assumption assume for that segment thanks? Brian P. McKeon: Thank you, yeah, of course it is a global business. We had a good Rapid assay performance around the world. It is predominantly North American. We had good performance in North America that was more volume than it was price. I think our reps are pretty engaged in Rapid assay business it is combine with their -- the value that they are bringing with SNAP Pro, a placement so when they're placing SNAP Pro they are really talking about the entire Rapid assay family. Our 2018 guidance for recurring revenue growth incorporates the benefit of the second half year launch of SNAP Fecal. And so I think you know I think our overall Rapid assay growth if you will combined scope of what I would call reasonable assumptions for the Rapid assay business augmented by new revenues from a new product launch. Of course that will take time to be adopted so we're only talking about a partial launch and like everything we just like the ramp to be faster than it will be. But that will be new revenue from new innovation. Jonathan W. Ayers: And it was price -- volume driven growth. Brian P. McKeon: Volume driven growth in the fourth quarter and in 20\u2026 Jonathan W. Ayers: We always have a timing of -- year-over-year timing of programs that are underlying 2% to 3% recurring CAG price gains is pretty consistent across\u2026 Brian P. McKeon: Yes, we just -- we had just good performance in Rapid assay. We saw market share gains, continued market share gains in the first generation in 2017 and the vector-borne disease franchise just continues to grow in volume. And even though we're 15 or 16 years into that it just shows the long runways of growth that we have. In fact that was the best volume growth we've had in that franchise in a number of years. But every year it's grown so it's still amazing that we don't have as many dogs as we have that get annual screening for vector-borne diseases. Erin Wright : Great and I'm curious on your thoughts on just the overall market as we stand here kind of, I felt that you saw strong 6% growth in practice revenues across your data set, I guess what does your guidance imply for 2018 in terms of the underlying demand trends across the CAG segment and where does it stand now, I guess how much room do we have to run, I know we've seen this massive improvements since the recession over in terms of overall veterinary demand trends but I guess what are some of the key metrics that you're tracking and looking at that give you kind of confidence in underlying demand, thanks? Jonathan W. Ayers: Well we have as Brian reported the 6% growth in veterinary practices which really comes out of it. That's a measured number out of what 5000 or 6000 of practices that we saw in Q4 and really consistent with the growth over the course of the year. And that's overall practice revenue at our customer level. Our assumptions for 2018 are consistent with really what we saw in 2017. But the runway every time we look at this, the runway for growth is amazing because what's interesting is our customers are growing faster than the market. We can measure this okay, our customers are growing faster, they're growing their overall practice revenues faster, they're growing their diagnostic portion of their revenues faster. They are growing it faster because our reps are helping them adopt more and more diagnostics to meet the changing needs of today's pet owner. What's interesting is the best practices in doing this are 2-3 X times the size of the average practice and just in our portfolio practices who are themselves above the market averages. And so we see the opportunity to help customers appreciate that while they may be doing well they can actually be doing better because other practices that are very much like them are doing better. And so the diversity of practice -- of performances inspires us to inspire the practices, to continue to focus on advancing diagnostic utilization and protocols using IDEXX's expanded and unique menu of tools to bring value to pet health. And to do so meeting the needs of the pet owners that want this when they appreciate the value and of course some -- the best practices are doing a great job doing that. So we need to bring those best practices to the broad market and that's why we have very deep sales coverage with strong account relationships so we can grow not just adoption of IDEXX but adoption of diagnostics as part of the care equation. Operator : And we go to the line of Jon Block with Stifel Nicolaus, please go ahead. Jonathan Block : Great, thanks, and good morning. Maybe two questions, first one what still needs to be done from a regulatory standpoint for SNAP Fecal antigen, is that sort of a gating factor between I don't know a June launch versus September? And part two sorry, that same first question is maybe you can just talk to us some of the moving parts of call it the low end of the organic guidance versus the high end, the 9.5 versus the 11.5 as you look at the year. Is it based on traction with new projects or limiting Rapid assay in roads from competitor, the overall market, would love to just get your thoughts and then I got a follow-up? Jonathan W. Ayers: Very quickly on the first question a point of care test, that tests for infectious diseases is one of the few areas that requires a regulatory approval. So for instance our lab test, fecal antigen test does not require regulatory approval but the same technology on a stamp does and so that does -- that is a factor that will that we need to be successful with, the U.S.D.A. approval in order to launch the product. We're confident of the track record there that always adds a little bit of uncertainty as to exactly which month or when Brian P. McKeon: Yeah, and just in terms of revenue outlook the key driver of that of course is going to be the recurring CAG growth number Jon so that's the 12% to 14% if you adjust for the accounting change, its 11% to 13%. We finished this year just under 13%. I think it's a reasonable range. We're obviously growing very quickly. In terms of high growth rate we need to execute very well and we think that's a reasonable range at this time in the year. It's not projecting risks, it's more just reflecting that we're growing off a base at high rates and need to execute well and need to execute well against the new innovation launches and that's principally why we have that type of range this time of the year. Jonathan Block : Okay, got it. Jonathan W. Ayers: One of the nice things is we over deliver in the fourth quarter on revenue so with the same growth rate that the absolute revenues in 2018 are -- they're growing off higher base. So, as Brian said we need to continue to do a great job executing and supporting our customers with great products, reliable products, and great sales coverage around the world. Jonathan Block : Got it and just the second question, you deemed across most of the CAG were occurring modalities but maybe the only one that I could sort of nitpick on was international lab. I think you mentioned up high single-digits for the second consecutive quarter, the U.S. has been up mid teens. It just seems like a relatively big delta and I think that's for the second or third quarter we've seen that delta. Arguably international should sort of be in that sweet spot of SDMA. And I know the competitive landscape is more fragmented O.U.S. So Jon any reason why that international rough lab is call it lagging some of the other diagnostic modalities that we see with the mid teen growth from some of your other areas? Thanks guys. Jonathan W. Ayers: Yeah, I think that's a fair observation from my relative basis. Of course I wouldn't sneeze at high single-digit organic revenue growth in any business in the current market. But relative to the success of our other businesses a fair characterization. The fact of the matter is our international organizations are really prioritizing the highly profitable placements of Catalysts where we just have a unique instrument you know you saw those Catalysts placements up 37% year-over-year and then the retention on these Catalysts is like 100% and 99.95% or something. It's an amazing business, it's a -- these are profitable placements and then we also have a reference lab business. By the way the Reference Lab business is not as profitable as other lab business internationally whereas in the U.S. we've got a really good network effect taking place. We want to make sure that we have that network in fact in place and that when we grow the Reference Lab business and let's recognize a reference lab business internationally there is a lot of different labs in a lot of different regions. Our German lab for example is doing very well, it's very profitable business which is why we're investing in a world class lab. As part of the relocation of the core German lab. Other parts of the world are not as profitable as they need to be and so we're focused more on profitability there before growth with the -- again the primary sales growth being the placement of the analyzer. These analyzers that we're placing today are going to be there decades from now. I mean it's just it's just a great business. Operator : And we will go to the line of Nicholas Jansen with Raymond James and Associates. Please go ahead. Nicholas Jansen : Hey guys and congrats on a great quarter. Just following up on that point Jon, just looking at the Greenfield opportunities O.U.S. versus U.S. as you think about Catalyst. Certainly the U.S. opportunity is probably starting to diminish a bit. I mean where are we on the O.U.S. trajectory as a number of that test still outstanding that could be upgraded, areas where you're seeing competitive displacements, just maybe walk us through how we think about the sustainability of this global like Catalyst placement growth that we've seen over the last three years? Jonathan W. Ayers: Yeah, I just do want to note the 25% year-over-year growth and Catalyst placements to new and competitive counts in North America I don't want to gloss over that a number. Our U.S. teams had an extraordinary quarter and we think there's a lot of runway ahead in the U.S. because of the result of the fabulous product line now supported by SDMA and great commercial teams but turning to the essence of your question on the international opportunity, it's wide open. And as you know we've shared the number of customers who we believe are targets for Catalyst placements internationally. Over 75,000 customers and that\u2019s a growing number of course. And so we're upgrading that test but roughly half of those placements are to new and competitive accounts. So they're organic accounts, we're replacing really an aged install base of competitive analyzers that have really fallen behind and then of course once we put Catalyst in there it stays there which I've mentioned with a very, very high retention rates. We have markets like China where it's basically a Greenfield opportunity and then we have markets like Europe that's both a vet test and a very attractive Greenfield and new account and competitive account. We as Brian mentioned in a previous question we are moving -- international was now moving to the compensation approach which looks at the economic value index of an instrument placement. What this is going to do is put even more focus on new and competitive.  Well it turns out our vet test customers internationally are pretty loyal customers. I mean they're in the high 90's in terms of their loyalty and so it's not like we have to rush to upgrade them because they're already pretty loyal. Of course we will continue to do so but the highest value placement is to a newer competitive account and as we move to EVI we expect to see a jump in the productivity of the same sales efforts towards the highest value placement. So even with the phenomenal success we had in 2017 we would expect to see a productivity jump in 2018 in placements and yet we have very, very -- less than -- a little bit less than 4000 placements of Catalyst internationally and you put that in the context of the opportunity. We have a long runway of opportunity for filling out the world with a very attractive point of care technology to help veterinarians provide care for pets. And they're all going to have SDMA. And so we're running, we are rolling out SDMA internationally in the next couple of months on Catalyst and so that -- and the international markets have developed the market appreciation for SDMA. So they're just as excited as our North American teams were with the availability of SDMA now being able to be run on Catalyst. Brian P. McKeon: I will just reinforce the strap we talked about, the build to our five year growth and trying to achieve over the next five years 20,000 placements in international markets and we're right on track with that. So this year was right in that range and we're building each year the percentages coming out of new and competitive placements. So we're feeling very good about the execution on the international front. Nicholas Jansen : That's very helpful and as we think about the recurring revenue associated with those O.U.S. Catalysts placements where we are on the utilization map on those relative to the U.S. and if you can maybe compare that to maybe three or five years ago are we seeing more and more utilization off of these boxes as these end markets become more like the U.S. or are we still very early in that transition? Jonathan W. Ayers: So it's a great question, the bottom line is we're still very early, okay but we are seeing a same store sales growth and we're seeing it because they're adding menu. We saw it with P4 when we had P4 to a Catalyst install base. We're going to see it with SDMA and interesting parameter we don't talk that much about CRP. We've launched CRP now globally. There are markets outside the U.S. that already value CRP. We don't have to explain to them why that's an inflammatory market and they're adopting it that gross utilization. So, as we add menu to the analyzer we see growth in utilization of the installed base. Where we really haven't even begun the story outside of North America it's preventive care. And so that's kind of the next wave, it's not a 2018 wave, it's couple of years out as we grow the market, as we grow our intensity of sales coverage we can then really take the preventative care story around the world. But right now they're just working on sick animal testing and so it's just amazing how early we are in the whole story and yet we are we're getting utilization growth primarily from sick animal testing from this menu expansion which customers appreciate is helpful in helping rule in and rule out disease on a sick presentation. Operator : And we go to the line, I am sorry go ahead. Jonathan W. Ayers: We have time for one more question, I know we're up against the hour. Operator : Absolutely, the last question will come from the line of Alex Nowak with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Alexander Nowak : Great, good morning everyone. I just had a two part question. Jon you mentioned this in your prepared comments but regarding tax reform to your customers is it fair to say that most of that customers will see some sort of tax rate because I believe the personal service corporations are going from a flat 35% rate to 21%? And then the second part of that is have you talked with any customers since the beginning of the year and have they signaled what they plan to do with the extra income such as reinvest into analyzers, is that place filled out or they just simply plan to park the extra cash? Jonathan W. Ayers: Okay, very quickly we expect most to answer your question it's a little complicated because there's a couple of different moving parts but the bottom line is yes, our customers will see benefit. They're all small businesses, they are [indiscernible]. They will see a benefit to tax reform. I think they're just beginning to realize. I am seeing around the corner on this okay, I don't think our customers fully appreciate because they didn't take tax accounting in veterinary school. Okay, they ask their accountants and their accountants are still trying to figure it all out. So here we are February 1st, I would say it's still early days. So what I'm saying is as this starts to -- as they start to see the benefits I think their appreciation for the attractiveness of their business gives them some room to make incremental investments and of course we're going to be there inspiring them with IDEXX technology. Alexander Nowak : Okay, that's helpful. And then you are only couple weeks into the SDMA launching Catalyst but are you seeing any cannibalization of SDMA in the reference web? Jonathan W. Ayers: No, we -- absolutely not. This is all a testing begets testing. We in fact think the estimated option in our in house will actually grow the Reference Lab business because of the appreciation. We have seen this issue in launch after launch where we have something in Reference Lab and then we launch it in-house. It actually helps our Reference Lab. You can go back 15 years when we launched a five part white blood cell differential with absolute ridiculous sides with laser sight or by studying you are going to see Campbell's any reference lab and you've seen what's really happened to our reference lab over that period of time. So we actually think this augments Reference Lab growth over time because it accelerates the clinical appreciation of SDMA in the care of pets. Alexander Nowak : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : And I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Ayers for closing remarks. Jonathan W. Ayers: Yes, thank you very much. We had the little bit longer comments because of the end of the year and because the number of exciting things going on at IDEXX. So I appreciate we didn't get into all the questions and we'll try to do so afterwards. And we appreciate all the attention. I just really want to thank the IDEXX organization for fabulous 2017 and the excitement and momentum that we have I think will be evidenced at the BMX previously known as the North American veterinary conference show that's taking place this weekend. I know some of our investors will be there. Our sales teams will be there. We're very excited about the prospects for 2018 and I think that's reflected in our comments and in our financial guidance for 2018. This is a long-term enduring growth business. As we enhanced the health and wellbeing of pets, people, and livestock we see the long-term growth vectors ahead of us. So with that we will close the call and thank you very much for signing in. Operator : Thank you and ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. IDEXX's strong business momentum continued in Q1 reflected in another quarter of excellent financial results. We achieved 16% reported revenue growth driven by 13% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, 21% growth in premium instrument placements and favorable FX changes. Our reported revenue and 12% overall organic growth results reflect the implementation of the new revenue accounting standard, which now more closely aligns instrument revenue recognition with the timing of the instrument placement. In Q1, $12 million of revenue was attributed to implementation of the New Revenue Standard. A significant portion of this amount related to the introduction of a very successful multi-modality customer program called IDEXX 360, which drove strong U.S. premium instrument placements in the quarter. EPS was $1.01 per share, an increase of 32% on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting strong revenue growth, solid operating margin gains, and net benefits from U.S. Tax Reform. In terms of our outlook, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of $2.205 billion to $2.245 billion, as $15 million of operational upsides reflected in our updated projection for 10.5% to 12.5% full year organic revenue growth are offset by impacts from the strengthened U.S. dollar. We're increasing our 2018 EPS outlook, $0.02 per share to $4.06 to $4.20 or 30% to 35% growth on a comparable constant currency basis. This incorporates our higher revenue outlook and consistent expectations for 75 basis points to 125 basis points in full year constant currency operating margin improvement, resulting in a $0.04 per share full year operational upside. Our outlook also incorporates an additional $0.02 in projected benefits from stock compensation activity. These upsides are offset by a negative $0.04 per share impact from updated FX assumptions. We will review our updated 2018 outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with the review of our Q1 performance by segment and region. Please note that, as we review our results by segment, the organic growth rates referenced include benefits attributable to the New Revenue Standard. Q1 performance was led by continued momentum in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were $471 million, up 13% organically driven by strong gains in recurring CAG revenues, high premium CAG instrument placements and continued high growth in our digital business. Global recurring CAG Diagnostic revenues increased over 13% organically despite a 1% equivalent day headwind. These results included a $4 million or about 1% benefit from revenue accounting standard changes, primarily related to impacts from our modified retrospective restatement. Veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging system revenues increased 10% organically. These results were supported by solid growth in recurring software services associated with our practice management platforms and 40% year-on-year increase in digital system placements. Our Water business revenues grew 12% organically in the first quarter to $29 million, reflecting solid growth in the U.S. and strong gains in international markets, including about 3% in year-on-year growth benefit from our Brazil go-direct initiative. These benefits will moderate as we work through the year. Water growth in Q1 reflected about 2% growth benefit attributed to later ship-off cutting rules under the New Revenue Standard. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue in Q1 was $32 million, up 2% organically. Strong gains in pregnancy product sales, solid growth in recurring livestock diagnostic test revenues and higher herd health screening levels were offset by continued market demand impacts on our dairy testing business and moderate declines in European disease eradication program revenues. By region, U.S. revenues were $327 million in the quarter, up 13% organically driven by 13% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and strong growth in premium instrument placements. U.S. recurring revenue gains were supported by continued strong double-digit growth in reference labs and consumables, and high-single digit growth in rapid assay sales supported by solid volume gains in our 4Dx franchise. U.S. CAG recurring diagnostic price gains continued to trend in the 2% to 3% range. U.S. recurring CAG Diagnostic customer retention metrics also continued to improve supporting our accelerated growth profile. IDEXX U.S. recurring CAG growth performance continues to significantly outpace U.S. veterinary practice market growth reflected in our dataset from about 7,500 clinics. In Q1, patient visits were up 0.6% and clinic revenues increased 4.8% compared to the prior-year period, a slight moderation from recent trends impacted in part by less favorable weather comparisons. International revenues in Q1 were $210 million, up 11% organically. International results were driven by 13% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. This reflected continued high consumable revenue gains supported by our expanding Catalyst instrument base and increasing utilization and strong growth in European lab revenues. In terms of segment performance, Q1 results were supported by expansion of our premium instrument base and strong global gains across CAG Diagnostic testing modalities. Globally, we've placed a Q1 record 2,822 premium analyzers, up 21% compared to prior year levels. These results were driven by 1,403 Catalyst placements, a 24% year-on-year increase, 664 SediVue placements, up 72%, and 755 premium hematology instruments globally. In addition to the strong premium instrument results, we placed 1,190 SNAP Pros in the quarter, expanding our SNAP Pro installed base to over 20,000. Continued strong Catalyst performance was driven by 1,034 placements in international markets, up 39% year-on-year, and 288 placements to new and competitive accounts in North America. Consistent with our strategic focus, 78% of North American Catalyst placements were at new or competitive accounts in the quarter. Globally, our installed Catalyst instrument base increased 22% year-on-year in Q1, reflecting 10% year-on-year growth in North America, and 37% year-on-year gains in international markets. CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues in Q1 were $31 million, up 12% organically, including $7 million in revenues attributed to the accounting standard change. As noted, this amount was primarily related to the launch of the IDEXX 360 customer program in the U.S., which provides customers with benefits from doing business across IDEXX's product lines, and supported our success in driving SediVue and Catalyst placements in the quarter. Our EVI index increased at a double-digit pace in North America. And we're now using this approach in our international markets as well, aligning our placement strategy globally with maximizing recurring CAG Diagnostic annuity revenues. Benefits from an expanding instrument base, test innovation and enhanced commercial capability, continue to drive strong recurring CAG Diagnostic revenue gains across our major modalities. Consumable revenues of $150 million grew 17% organically in Q1. Results reflected strong double-digit organic gains across U.S. and international markets. Our focus on innovation continues to drive growth in real-time care with SediVue and SDMA on a slide, contributing nearly 3% combined to year-on-year consumable gains in the quarter. Reference laboratory and consulting services with revenues of $187 million grew 14% organically in the first quarter. Gains were driven by continued mid-teen organic reference lab gains in the U.S. Strong U.S. gains continue to be primarily volume driven reflecting high levels of growth with existing customers and steadily improving new customer acquisition and customer retention rates. We also achieved high single digit lab growth in international markets, compared to strong prior year growth levels, supported by higher gains in Europe. Rapid assay revenues of $52 million grew 7% organically in Q1. Continued solid rapid assay gains were driven by volume growth in 4Dx and first-generation products, supported by seasonal stocking programs, as well as continued net price gains. Operating profit in Q1 was $113 million, up 23% as reported, or 18% on a constant currency basis, driven by high profit growth in our CAG and Water businesses. (10:31) of 100 basis points on a constant currency basis supported by solid gross margin gains and operating expense leverage from our strong revenue growth results in the quarter. Gross profit was $303 million in Q1, up 17% as reported or 13% on a constant currency basis. Gross margins increased 50 basis points on a constant currency basis. These gains were supported by continued solid net price gains and volume leverage in our VetLab and reference lab businesses, which offset effects from reinvestment of U.S. tax reform benefits and about 20 basis points of gross margin impact from OpEx to cost of goods, cost reclassifications in our lab business. Foreign exchange hedge losses, which impact gross profit, were approximately $2 million in Q1. Operating expenses in Q1 were up 15% or 11% on a constant currency basis, resulting in 50 basis points of positive operating margin leverage. Operating expense increases reflected year-on-year impacts from our expanded U.S. commercial capability, higher levels of R&D investment, growth in enabling information technology capability, and impacts from reinvestment of U.S. tax reform benefits. EPS in Q1 was $1.01 per share, including $9.6 million or $0.11 per share in benefit related to share-based compensation activity, which tends to be highest in Q1. On a comparable constant currency basis, EPS increased 32% including net benefits from U.S. tax reform. Our effective tax rate was 14.3% in Q1, including 9.2% of tax rate benefit from share-based compensation impacts. Foreign exchange, net of hedge impacts in Q1 2017 and 2018, increased operating profit by $4 million and EPS by $0.04 per share. Free cash flow was $11 million in Q1, reflecting normal quarterly seasonality. We continued to maintain our full-year outlook for free cash flow of 80% to 85% of net income for 2018, including approximately 15% of free cash flow impact driven by $50 million of combined incremental capital spending related to our Westbrook, Maine headquarter expansion and our German core lab relocation, as well as $5 million of incremental growth capital investment supported by additional cash flows associated with U.S. tax reform. Incorporating these investments, our 2018 free cash flow outlook for projected capital spending remains at $140 million. We allocated $86 million in capital to repurchase 465,000 shares in Q1. We also used our increased flexibility under U.S. tax reform to optimize our global cash and debt balances, resulting in a reduction in our revolving debt outstanding. We ended Q1 with $1.020 billion in debt, $159 million in cash, and $442 million in capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 1.87 times gross and 1.58 times net of cash and investment balances. We're maintaining our 2018 full-year outlook for reduction in average shares outstanding from stock repurchases of 1% to 1.5%, which assumes that we maintain net leverage at approximately 1.5 times EBITDA. We continue to project annual net interest expense of $35 million to $36 million. In terms of our updated P&L outlook for 2018, as noted, we're maintaining our full-year reported revenue guidance of $2.205 billion to $2.245 billion, incorporating $15 million of benefit from a 1% increase in our expectations for a full-year organic revenue growth now projected at 10.5% to 12.5%. This outlook reflects consistent expectations for 12% to 14% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and increased expectations for instrument revenues, including benefits from our strong Q1 performance and growing premium instrument placements. Operational revenue upsides are offset by a $15 million adjustment to our FX assumptions, reflecting the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We currently estimate a 1.5% revenue growth benefit in 2018 related to foreign exchange at the rate shown in our press release, resulting in full-year reported revenue growth of 12% to 14%. We're raising our 2018 full year EPS guidance $0.02 per share to $4.06 to $4.20, reflecting an outlook for 30% to 35% comparable constant currency EPS growth. This incorporates 4% in operational upsides related to our higher revenue outlook and consistent expectations for 75 basis points to 125 basis points in full year constant currency operating margin improvement. We're also refining our outlook for our 2018 effective tax rate to 19.5% to 20.5%, including an updated estimate of $12.5 million to $16.5 million or approximately 3% in full year projected tax rate benefit from exercise of stock-based compensation. This provides $0.02 per share on EPS upside compared to earlier estimates. Offsetting these benefits are updated projections for year-on-year impacts in foreign exchange rates at the rates shown in our press release. We now estimate that foreign exchange rate changes will increase reported EPS by $0.07 per share, approximately $0.04 per share below earlier estimates. This is net of approximately $5 million in currently projected hedge losses. There's been a significant amount of movement in currency rates in recent days related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and our outlook incorporates recent FX rate levels. In our 10-Q, we highlight sensitivities to change in currency rates. Based on our projections an additional 1% strengthening of the U.S. dollar would reduce balance of year revenue by approximately $6 million and operating income by approximately $1.7 million net of hedges. In terms of our second quarter outlook, we expect reported revenue growth in the 12% to 13.5% range supported by organic revenue gains of 10.5% to 11.5%. In terms of our P&L outlook, we expect gross margins to be relatively flat in Q2 compared to prior year levels, reflecting relatively tougher year-on-year comparisons in the quarter as well as impacts from tax reform related reinvestment and lab information system cost reclassifications. We also expect relatively higher year-on-year growth in operating expenses in part driven by timing of R&D investments. Combined, we expect these factors will lead to flat Q2 2018 operating margins compared with prior year Q2 levels of 24%. We expect our effective tax rate in Q2 to be 21% to 22% including projected benefits from share based compensation exercise activity. That concludes the financial review. Let me turn the call over to Jon for his comments. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Brian. Our strategy to advanced standard of care for pets around the world is purring along nicely as we wrap up the first quarter of the new year. Great results shared by Brian. Sales force and professional productivity in growing the business with our customers was the standout theme for the quarter. And this is evidenced by our Companion Animal Group Diagnostic recurring revenue growth of 13% globally. As investors know, we have moved to an economic value index or EVI to measure quarterly instrument placements both for our reps commissions and for IDEXX. EVI measures the quarterly impact of the value of instrument placements in building profitable recurring revenues. Prioritizing efforts by EVI of placements and empowers our field professionals to allocate their time and efforts to a mix of placements and programs that maximize long-term shareholder value. In Q1, we moved to this EVI compensation and measurement system with our international operations, building on the success of the North American field transition to EVI in the beginning of 2017. As Brian mentioned, the EVI of our North American placements grew double-digits in Q1 of 2018 supported by exceptional growth of SediVue. For the rest of the world, the year-over-year growth in EVI from instrument placements was far stronger supported by both strong unit placement and greater percentage of Catalyst placements to new and competitive accounts. Of note, new and competitive placements of Catalyst outside of North America, was up 56% year-over-year in Q1. We also continue to align our commercial efforts across our modalities to support customer growth and advancements in the standards of care. In Q1, our German team successfully transitioned our commercial organization from two different roles focused separately on instruments and labs respectively to a single account coverage model that we have used in the U.S. for the past several years. In this model, a single sales force supports and advances the full IDEXX offering of in-house instrument and reference lab diagnostic offerings. Our German team executed this transition brilliantly. Along with being fully direct in Germany as we are in most markets around the world, we're now set up for accelerated growth in this very important country just as we have achieved in the U.S. since we made the change to a customer-centric sales model. Innovation continues to be a key driver globally. Expanded menu on our instrument platforms including T4, SDMA and CRP, an inflammatory marker, grow the same customer instrument recurring revenue and contributed to our 17% organic instrument consumable revenue recurring growth as well as growth \u2013 another contributor, of course, was growth from SediVue recurring revenues that came from new instrument placements. New menu adoption by our Catalyst customers will continue to be a growth driver for years to come and of course increase the value of a new Catalyst placement. Our remarkable test for kidney function IDEXX SDMA had its first quarter of general availability in our in-house Catalyst customer \u2013 chemistry platform in North America in Q1. In this short period, 42% of North American Catalyst customers have adopted the test in clinic with the vast majority of these already using it on a regular basis. Having our proprietary SDMA Test on our in-house instrument, advances several strategic growth objectives for IDEXX. Obviously, Catalyst SDMA generates a new stream of instrument consumable recurring revenues. Second, it further secures the long-term loyalty of Catalyst customers as the test is unique to IDEXX. Third, as customers add SDMA to their in-house profiles, they build upon their reference lab experience with IDEXX accelerating to what we term the journey to believe that SDMA is an essential element of the routine chemistry panel. The independent KOLs at the pinnacle of veterinary medicine have already completed this journey as they have been involved with and informed of full complement of studies, which provide the irrefutable evidence of SDMA's clinical value as an early indicator of a variety of diseases that have in common that impact kidney function. To put a point on this, in one study, looking at the blood profiles of dogs and cats having a wellness exam adding SDMA to the existing chemistry panel of 21 tests, just one additional test, uncovered another 50% of patients versus the baseline of 21 tests that needed further work-up. In other words, even in seemingly healthy patients, SDMA dramatically increases the detection of hidden problems. The statistics shows just how important and profound SDMA is as a diagnostic innovation in routine wellness, and in fact the importance of routine wellness testing not to mention sick animal testing. Catalyst SDMA was launched in Canada in January and the UK in March. The other major international countries will follow in Q2 with a few in Q3. The addition of the SDMA T4 combo kit for Catalyst, another advancement in point of care testing will launch in about a month in North America. Speaking of new products, an update on our SNAP Fecal launch timing. The assay is performing well and detecting intestinal parasite and our expected regulatory approval timeline is on schedule. The product prototypes are currently in field trials with customers, part of our disciplined new product development process that we use with all products in development. And as is typical of any product, we get many new insights with new to market products in the hands of technicians and practice before the formal launch. We've concluded there are certain workflow improvements that need to be made to deliver the exceptional customer experience expected from IDEXX. We anticipate these changes to be relatively straightforward, but will take a few extra months to validate. Given this pushes the launch into the very busy Q4, we're planning on a formal launch at the beginning of the New Year. Our new revenue guidance which we've increased on a constant currency basis by $15 million for the year fully reflects this new SNAP Fecal timing assumption. The guidance reflects tremendous momentum we have in the business today. I might note that with all the innovations that we have in the field and that we're bringing to the market in 2018, our field has no shortage of new products and services to sell, be it in reference labs, in-house instruments, and new test menu. I also want to comment on our veterinary software offerings with double-digit constant currency growth in Q1. In Q1, we had more than 1,600 customers who use our cloud-based practice information management software or PIMS. And we continue to grow our overall PIMS software customers and revenues, which include the franchise, Cornerstone and DVMAX product lines. All four of our PIMS software platforms are undergoing major investments leading to advanced capabilities for our customers, improved user experience and the support of multi-location corporate accounts, a growing segment of the market. Our cloud-based applications that customers subscribe to, in order to add value to their PIMS whether IDEXX PIMS or third-party, are also advancing in customer numbers and capabilities. These apps include cloud-based software to support wellness plans, digital radiography packs, client communications, multi practice enterprise management, and a specialty referral CRM for managing relationships with specialty referral clients to referring veterinarians. The grand daddy of all veterinary software applications in terms of footprint and the global market is VetConnect PLUS. With over 22,000 practices who use VetConnect PLUS each month, 12,500 of which are in the U.S. We broke 2 million results views in the U.S. alone in Q1, 2.9 million globally. That 2 million is an average of 160 results views for every active VetConnect PLUS IDEXX account in the U.S. market. We estimate that no other veterinary software in the world has even half the number of active accounts on a global basis. And IDEXX diagnostic customers that are highly engaged with VetConnect PLUS grow their diagnostic revenues at a rate three times faster than non-engaged VetConnect PLUS customers, which is why we're pleased that the adoption and utilization of VetConnect PLUS grew more than twice the rate of our underlying diagnostic volumes in Q1. Between our PIMS, our apps and the VetConnect PLUS franchise, we are uniquely positioned in veterinary software globally. And our guidance contemplates, as Brian mentioned, with the R&D accelerated investments in these platforms in 2018. Our software strategy confirms several strategic advantages for IDEXX. We can help our customers grow faster, grow profitably, while supporting staff engagement and productivity, so important to practices in the current labor environment. We accelerate IDEXX diagnostics usage and loyalty, and grow the profitable recurring revenues of both diagnostics and our veterinary software and services, and digital radiography businesses. In conclusion, the key elements of our strategy are clicking innovation and commercial execution which drives adoption of these innovations, and a software strategy that builds upon our diagnostic offering to accelerate customer growth and loyalty. All of us at IDEXX remain dedicated to our purpose to create exceptional long-term value for our customers, employees and shareholders by enhancing the health and wellbeing of pets, people and livestock. So with that Cindy, we'll open up the call to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. And we will go to line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse : Thanks so much. Can you speak to the nature of the Fecal SNAP timing change? Just what are you seeing in the initial field testing? And should we think of a bigger ramp in Fecal SNAP in 2019? I guess how much was truly embedded in 2018 assumptions originally? And also maybe the competitive landscape, are you seeing anyone in the wings as far as the Fecal SNAP test goes? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yes, great. As we mentioned, this really has no impact on our 2018 guidance. Our field team has a tremendous number of offerings to sell. Catalyst now with SDMA and the SDMA T4 combo kit, SediVue which just tremendous runway ahead of us, what a great product, hematology, we're still highly differentiated in hematology, the reference labs, both growing utilization and winning new customers. Preventative care is a big growth driver, organic growth driver for us and the industry's SNAP Pro placements. You saw the digital radiography, the software, the VetConnect PLUS with major advancement. So really, we see the small amount of revenues that we had in our original plan is really being supplanted by growth in all these other areas, and really gives us confidence for the year. In fact, Q1 is the most logical time to launch a new point of care SNAP assay at the beginning of the year with a lot of focus on new products. We're going into the season for \u2013 we're testing most intestinal parasites around people's minds in the summer when dogs are at the dog parks. And we do not expect or see anything on the competitive front. This was quite frankly the assay, which is performing very well. It took us ten years to find and develop the reagents for the three key worms, which we offer by the way in the reference lab. We have a fecal antigen, one of the big drivers of reference lab growth. And that's all a proprietary reagent. So, we think this will be a proprietary product for a long time certainly if you look at the length of our patents. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And Erin, it will obviously provide a nice uplift for our growth in terms of being all incremental compared to this year. I think you had a question on competitive to this, this is not related to anything going on competitively. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse : Okay. Great. And then I think your competitive placements overall for instruments were pretty strong. I guess what was some of the key drivers of that? I mean any sort of promotional activity or just better traction and better sales force maturity there? Anything you could, I guess, elaborate on would be great. Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I think we're continuing to innovate in how we advance the customer's journey to belief in the importance of our innovative diagnostics and the care of the pet. I would put it mostly on sales force productivity and not just sales force, but of course the supporting marketing. We have the importance of our other professionals in the field whether they are the professional service veterinarians and the field support reps. Our international had a tremendous growth. I think that was the adoption of EVI for international, obviously the U.S. is getting stronger and stronger in understanding how EVI can drive profitable growth. And yet, we still are discovering innovations to advance the customer's journey to believe in all areas, whether they are the importance of a fresh urinalysis to preventative care. It's amazing the amount of hidden disease. We've done a study for wellness really well, absolutely nothing wrong, by the way nothing wrong to the pet owner, nothing wrong to the veterinarian upon the exam, and yet one in eight dogs and cats in the adult age, one in six in senior and two in five in the geriatric category have evidence of underlying disease when you run the basic chemistry, hematology and SDMA. I mean these are extraordinary numbers. And we're bringing these numbers to the field. I mean, they are both the importance of testing and of course the addition of our unique proprietary assay such as SDMA and our advancements in the hematology area, which remain unique. And so, this is a huge opportunity for growth. It's shocking that only 14% of clinical visits in our customer base, which is probably more advanced in the customer mix generally include a basic chemistry panel where the sick animal are well and roughly half the visits are wellness. So, there is tremendous opportunity for growth ahead of us in the diagnostic category, and of course that's going to relate to overall practice growth because when they find things, then they need to address them. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yes. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Jon, I was hoping you could provide a bit more detail or color around IDEXX 360 in regards to when that was launched and what it encompasses? And I'm curious if that's primarily targeted at new customers or new placements or if that's more broadly positioned across the entire customer base? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Well, thank you again for the question, Ryan. It's a really interesting question. It's certainly not a boring question. It's been very successful to us, the launch of the IDEXX 360 program in the first quarter of 2018, in North America. We call it 360 because it's all encompassing or complete. And really what it is is it's a friendly way for customers to adopt more of our portfolio and also adopt more of our menu in our instruments. And so, the reason why it's called 360, it's an all-encompassing or complete diagnostic offering and really leverages the fact that we have a complete portfolio of in-house and very full in-house with the urinalysis and the rapid assay and the reference lab to grow the business. And it's also \u2013 a second reason is, it gives a 360-degree view on the patient's health. Because you can combine both what you might run on an in-house test with what you might reflex or run on the reference lab and have all that available to you in VetConnect PLUS with advanced testing options that are unique to IDEXX. So it is a program which leverages the fact that we're in all the modalities and makes it easier for customers to adopt, whether it's new systems or come over to our reference lab growing same-store sales, winning new customers on a modality basis, and it's been \u2013 as you can see, it's been very successful, which is interesting because any new programs sometimes takes the field a little while to learn and they picked this one up relatively quickly in the first quarter with great success. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. That's helpful color. And then as my follow-up, one on the sales force more specific to the international operations. You discussed Germany in particular is moving to kind of a single sales team like the United States. And I know internationally the EVI launched. How broad if you look at your non-U.S. business now, have you kind of moved that towards the U.S. sales model with the combined team in EVI? And how far along or what inning do you see that in because I know that could be a big uplift for international growth longer term? Thank you. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. It turns out people love their pets all over the world and the opportunity for us is in basically every market depending on its size. And so we're about 99% of our Companion Animal Group revenues are sold direct which gives us full opportunity to work with the customers to grow utilization. And as you know utilization and just diagnostic protocols outside of the U.S. are behind where the U.S. are. EVI is essentially, although not 100%, it's essentially adopted in all of our direct markets. There are a couple of remaining small markets that are still in process. And for the most of the markets we do have a customer-centric Veterinary Diagnostic Consultant model. Germany is a very important country for us. Because there is tremendous in-house opportunity for us and, of course, we have very strong lab presence that we're augmenting with the adoption \u2013 with building out an expansion and a new core lab in Germany which, of course, will be a network for a variety of European countries as well as Germany. And so each country has its kind of unique aspects in terms of our sales model, but we're very pleased. It's not easy to translate. As you all told us when we did this several years ago in the U.S. market, it is not easy to move sales roles. And I'm just very proud of our German team for doing it and showing that it can be done. I think we leveraged a lot of learnings from the U.S. in doing that in Canada. We're pretty much a common model in Australia. So as you can see here, it's becoming more and more, but it's a step-by-step process. We're not fully adopted yet. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. We will go to line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Hi, guys. Congrats on the quarter. I had a couple questions on some of the moving pieces for the quarter. You had, by our notes, one fewer selling day, and you also talked about the weather impact in the U.S. in the northeast in March as have others. And then there is also Easter timing in Europe. So I was just wondering if you could sort of parse out the headwinds from those issues? I mean you still put up a good print despite that, but I'm trying to get a sense of sort of the underlying performance if you normalize for these one-off effects? Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. It was basically a 1% headwind on recurring revenues which we noted. The weather is a hard thing to parse. I think it didn't impact our business. We had a great quarter. I think in the market. Overall it likely had somewhat of headwind, but it's just a little tougher to estimate. But I think the one... Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: It was a normal winter and last year was a mild winter. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And so it just reinforces we had great performance, very strong performance. I'd point out in markets like Europe, we had up against a tough compare in the lab business, we had a really nice quarter there as well. So very pleased with how we started the year particularly in context of some of that. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. That helps. And then to clarify one other point. The accounting change, the revenue recognition, ASU 2014-09. On the 4Q call when you raised the guide for the year by 50 bps, you called out that that was due to that accounting change. And then in this quarter you recognized, you called out an incremental $12 million. That looks like it's right about the 50 bps for the year. So is it right that you're not expecting any more incremental revenue for the rest of the year from the accounting change? Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, why don't you take... Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Those are two different things. So obviously what we talked about in the Q1, much of that was anticipated in Q4, right? So it wasn't incremental for the Q4. And we have \u2013 this now aligns with instrument revenues. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. Why don't I just take a minute to give you a little background on the accounting impacts because it takes a minute to kind of digest and understand. But, look, as context, we raised our outlook for 2018 by $15 million and that reflected the Q1 performance as Jon talked about as well as our updated projections for placements and program mix which are all aligned with this new revenue recognition standard. And I think it's important to understand that under the new standard, the instrument revenues are now going more closely track placements. So if you think across the different programs that we have, revenues under volume commitment programs and rebate programs and upfront programs are all basically in that aligned now with revenue recognition, at the time of the placement. When you look at the accounting, what's attributed to the accounting impact, calculations of what's attributed can be impacted by changes in program mix which are independent of how many you place. So, for example, under this new accounting guidance, 100% of the revenue from a new program like IDEXX 360 is treated as being related to the implementation of the new revenue standard. And the reason why is that under previous GAAP, this is basically a volume commitment program. Those revenues would have been deferred. So basically what you have is program mix shifts, which don't impact our view on placements, which drive revenue are being \u2013 are attributed to the accounting standards. You just can't take that first quarter effect and multiply it by four. What we did is we're updating our placement view. We took up the full-year numbers based on the strong start. It's all aligned with the new standard that has upfront revenue recognition. And as we work through the year, we'll do the reporting to go what's attributed to new standard, but I wouldn't focus on that metric as how to get at our revenue outlook, if you will. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Got it. I really appreciate that, Brian. If I could squeeze in one quick one. You talked about pricing gains for the year on CAG. Specifically in rapid assay, the 6.7% organic, strong volume in 4Dx. But can you talk about pricing on that, specifically for rapid assays and then for the 4Dx, was there anything going on in the quarter? Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Our pricing was up. I mentioned that. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: We had kind of the seasonal stocking programs we typically do. And that increase was net of those sets of programs. And our outlook for the year is we're trending in that 2% to 3% range and that's consistent across the modality. So we're continuing to get solid net price gains, but more of our growth is being driven by volume growth, and we've got excellent momentum on that front. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it, great. Thanks so much, guys. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you, Mike. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Maybe 2.5 questions, just one small clarification. So the first one, just 1Q 2018 market growth was a little lighter, market growth that is, was a little lighter per your metrics, actually in line with some of our checks as well. So anything that you can share for April, Jon, or just at a higher level I guess what I'm asking is do you think this was all weather specific, and that the overall industry trends remain solid? That's the first question. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I'd say, in summary, I think the overall industry trends remain quite solid. Q1 can be a little bit bumpy. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yes. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: But we see overall trends are quite solid. There is no reason to believe that they are not. And I would have mentioned that the revenue growth at the practice level was really not that different than what it has been historically at that 4.8%. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Okay. And then just certainly impressive to increase the guide, especially considering the new timing on SNAP Fecal antigen. That said, I should have always thought about IDEXX, you're the innovator maybe at least one new product per year. And so should we now think that SNAP Fecal antigen is that product for 2019? Or I guess any other tricks in the bag that you can allude to? And then I'll just have my final clarification question. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. I mean the product we're really pleased about right now is the Catalyst SDMA. This is an enormous product. It's interesting. You've seen the \u2013 you saw the 42% adoption rate in a very short period of time in the U.S. market, which really just shows the underlying demand for SDMA that we've built from the reference lab. Now some of those customers don't even use our reference lab. And so maybe they will use our reference lab now that they see the value of SDMA. And so we've got \u2013 and then we've got just great \u2013 we've got a completely differentiated hematology offering. Obviously SediVue is going great guns. And so when you launch a product, you've got like several years, many years of growth ahead of you. Clearly SNAP Fecal will be a big focus of launch in Q1 2019. I'm not ready to talk about any other products at this point in time, but you should expect, of course, continuous improvement in our existing products. So we just launched, for example, the new image algorithm for SediVue, Neural Network 3.0. And we expect to have a cadence of annual algorithm improvements that comes from the fact that at this point we have over 1 million patients that have been run on SediVue, and we use that with machine learning to advance the algorithm. Of course, it's unique to our Smart Service, the fact that all those images come back every day. And so the products will continue to have incremental advancements. But we're going to be \u2013 we have good product launch now scheduled for the beginning of 2019 with the SNAP Fecal. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, perfect. And a clarification, and Brian I think this is for you and hopefully I don't butcher this too bad, but you put up organic growth in CAG of 13.1%. The accounting change, if I remember correctly last quarter, was a 50 bp tailwind for 2018. Was that sort of going to come on board ratably throughout 2018? Or maybe asked differently, normalized for that accounting change, were you essentially at 12.5% for this quarter? Hopefully that makes sense. Thanks, guys. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yes. I'm going to go back to kind of the earlier responses that I gave, which is I think when you're trying to take what's attributed to the accounting change and adjust growth rates, I don't think will help you understand the trends in the business. And that the way the accounting disclosure work is, you attribute benefit to the accounting change for a new program like IDEXX 360 as if it's 100% related to an accounting change. And obviously this is a successful new program. It's just a mix change. So what I'd say is the underlying growth we were above where we thought we were going to be because we have really good instrument placements. And as we look at the updated full-year outlook, we've flowed that through, and we took it up more based on the momentum that we see and our estimates of what the program mix will be. And basically under all the programs, Jon, now the instrument placements are much more aligned with \u2013 the revenue is much more aligned with when you place the instruments. So we feel comfortable with that. And we'll try to help you understand the growth rate impacts, et cetera. But I think the underlying momentum of the business is very strong and sustainable under the new recognition standards. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, perfect. Thanks for your time, guys. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions and congrats on a great quarter. My first question is really on the news of Henry Schein's decision to spin out its animal health business and merge with your neighbor, Vets First Choice. Vets First Choice seems to be making some inroads by engaging pet owners. And so, I guess, I'm wondering if you can comment on the strategy of working directly with the pet owners, does that potentially have any overlap with any of the initiatives you have in your software initiative? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Well, first of all, we would like to congratulate the Henry Schein and Vets First Choice on their merger. As you know, we've moved away from distribution a number of years ago and we have a fully direct model which has been very, very successful for us. I would say that anything that engages pet owners, and in this case I think it's more compliance on with Vets First Choice, it's more compliance on therapeutics and preventatives and that kind of thing. But anything which grows the profession is good for the profession and is good for IDEXX. And so if this is pulled off and good, it's going to be a positive for us and a positive for practices as we firmly believe that pet owners \u2013 if practices can better serve pet owners, the underlying demand for pet care is \u2013 it's underserved, but dramatically underserved. And anything we can do or others can do to help practices better engage with pet owners is a good thing. So, yes, so that's our point of view. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. And then I know that Neo is a product that you guys launched a couple of years ago. Can you just give us an update on how the traction of that platform is going? Are you perhaps contemplating your software strategy in context of what Vets First Choice is doing in the market? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: We're very pleased with the progress, Neo which is cloud based. We're also pleased with Animana and between the two of them, we have 1,600 customers who use our cloud based practice management software. And of course, we also have a variety of apps which integrate with ours and other third-party softwares that add value for the customer. And so this is I think an exciting area, it's a dynamic area. We've made some accelerating investments in 2017 and more in 2018. And we really have an unparalleled U.S. and global footprint when you add up our PIMS or apps or VetConnect PLUS presence, all of which are back to that prior point of helping customers run their practices better, more efficiently and engage with pet owners better and thus advancing the growth of the profession. So we really think we have a sort of unparalleled offering and it's very important for us. And we'll continue to be growing it as part of our diagnostics and software strategy. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. And if I can one last quick one. I think at VMX you indicated that your total T4 slide hit about 60% ordering in its first year of launch. You are well on your way on SDMA on a slide at 42%. Do you have confidence that you can meet or exceed the T4 launch with SDMA? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I'm going to tell you, 42% within months of launch is an amazing, amazing accomplishment. And nothing happens fast in veterinary. Everything is \u2013 the adoption rates are typically very slow. And in that context, the adoption of SDMA on the slide has been exceptional. And so we're very, very pleased with the success we've had. We've really been fully in the market in the U.S in January. We took some preorders in the fourth quarter, but we're really just ramping up for the last four months. So I think that's a great number. And the nice thing about SDMA on the slide, as I mentioned, it actually increases the economic value of a placement of a Catalyst because it's an additional \u2013 a parameter that customers purchase. And thus the consumable stream from a Catalyst placement goes up just like with T4. And then as I mentioned, we are going to have the SDMA T4 combo kit, which I think is another kind of subtle, but it's going to be very appreciated by our customers because then they can just drop both those in together and with a chem panel and with older dogs and cats you really want to add T4 and of course you also have a very strong case to add SDMA to that for in-house testing. So we're very pleased with that strategy. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our final question will come from the line of Andrew Cooper with Raymond James. Your line is open. Andrew Cooper - Raymond James Financial, Inc. (Broker): Hi, guys. Thanks for sneaking me in here. Just a quick one from me. As we think of SediVue, kind of the placement trajectory there. Can you give us a little bit of color on what percentage of those are going to new customers versus back into the base and then on top of that, sort of what the attachment rate is relative to a new Catalyst placement there? And then lastly, if you can give us a little bit of an update if there is any changes to the pull through you have been seeing per day there that will be great? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, I would say that there's not a material change to your last question in the pull-through. You would think that with exceptional value that your analysis adds to clinical insight, you would think and yet that's really to my prior point, things don't change that fast. And so where I think we've said 3,000, 4,500 in consumables per placement of SediVue. And to your earlier \u2013 it's really all of the above. We're selling into our installed base. We're selling to customers when they buy the full suite. We're selling to customers who don't buy the full suite but maybe they're going to buy the full suite later. It's now very mature, very sophisticated instrument with huge differentiators. Of course, we've got the Pay per Run, which customers love because they don't have to buy consumable inventory in advance. We just had a very, very successful second year Free UA Day, which we can do because it's Pay per Run. We have one customer run 100 urinalysis in one day. That's a lot of urine. And that was a lot of clinical insight. And what we're finding is just like when you run a chemistry panel, there is a tremendous amount of clinical insight that you wouldn't always expect. When you run that urine, you find a lot of hidden disease and you're getting a better differential. So the runway on \u2013 I think you're going to find that in time a practice will feel incomplete without in-house urine sediment analyzer, just as they do today in large part with chemistry, hematology, radiography. This is a core component to be able to reach the basic standard of care in veterinary medicine in the U.S. and then of course we have the whole international, which we really haven't even gotten started on yet because we're having so much success with placing Catalysts as you saw from the numbers, but following on Catalyst over the next decade we'll have a second wave with a very sophisticated urine sediment analyzer in the form of SediVue. Andrew Cooper - Raymond James Financial, Inc. (Broker): Great. That's it for me. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And with that gentleman, I'd like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, thank you. We're just very pleased with our organic growth of 12% driven in large part by the CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue of 13%. That component of our revenue, that CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue constitutes 76% of the company's total revenue. It's a real driver, although the other parts of the company are well too. I want to certainly congratulate our Water business. It had an exceptional 12% quarter, but it is a high-single-digit organic grower with mid-40s operating margins and very little invested capital. It's really an exceptional business and our team is doing a great job there. They did a great job with the go-directs in Brazil. And then, comparable constant currency EPS growth of 32% was driven by strong fundamentals of our revenue growth and margin expansion and further aided by the net benefits of tax reform. So I just want to congratulate the IDEXX teams around the world for their successes in Q1 and the momentum we have in the business. I think everybody is very, very excited about what we can bring back to veterinary medicine. People love their pets, Millennials love their pets even more, and we can help veterinarians take care of those pets, live long, healthy lives. With that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference service.

We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue, and if time permits, we'll take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you and good morning, everyone. IDEXX delivered continued high growth and excellent financial results in Q2, building on our strong start to 2018. In terms of highlights, Q2 revenues of $581 million grew 14% on a reported basis, driven by consistent 13% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, 21% growth in premium instrument placements and favorable year-on-year foreign exchange changes. EPS was $1.23 per share, an increase of 33% on a comparable constant currency basis. These results reflect strong revenue growth, related operating expense leverage, which drove a 110 basis point constant currency improvement in operating margins, and net benefits from U.S. Tax Reform. In terms of our outlook, we're raising our full year organic growth outlook to 11.5% to 12.5% and refining our full year revenue guidance to $2.205 billion to $2.230 billion. The reported revenue outlook is down $7.5 million at the midpoint compared to our earlier guidance as operational upsides are offset by $20 million to $25 million of negative impact related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We're raising our 2018 EPS outlook by $0.02 at midpoint to $4.10 to $4.20, or 32% to 36% growth on a comparable constant currency basis. At the midpoint of our guidance range, this new outlook builds in approximately $0.07 per share of full year operational benefit related to our raised organic revenue growth outlook and updated expectations for 90 to 130 basis points in full year constant currency operating margin improvement, incorporating benefits from our strong first half performance. This outlook also factors in additional investments we're advancing in our global commercial capabilities, which we'll discuss in more detail today. We're also projecting $0.02 in full year EPS benefit related to a lower effective tax rate, including additional tax benefit related to stock compensation activity. These increases more than offset a negative $0.07 per share impact from our updated FX assumptions, net of hedges. We'll review our updated 2018 outlook in more detail later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our Q2 performance by segment and region. Strong Q2 results were driven by continued momentum in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were $507 million, up 13% organically, reflecting strong gains in recurring CAG Diagnostic revenues, high premium CAG instrument placements and continued solid growth in our software, services and diagnostic imaging system businesses. Global CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased over 13% organically, including a $5 million or approximately 1% growth rate benefit from revenue accounting standard changes primarily related to our modified retrospective restatement. Veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging system revenues increased 9% organically. These results were supported by solid growth in recurring software, services associated with our practice management platforms and continued strength in our diagnostic imaging business, driven by a 16% overall increase in diagnostic imaging system unit placements, including a 49% increase in high-end digital radiography system installations. Our Water business revenues grew 9% organically in the second quarter to $33 million, reflecting continued high single-digit growth in the U.S., augmented by strong gains in Asia and Latin America. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue in Q2 was $35 million, or flat organically. Growth in recurring livestock diagnostic test revenues in the U.S., Europe and Latin America was offset by lower revenues in Asia related to continued soft end-market conditions, including impact from lower milk prices globally. By region, U.S. revenues were $357 million in the quarter, up 13% organically, driven by a 12% increase in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and strong growth in premium instrument placements. U.S. recurring revenue gains were supported by mid-teen revenue growth in U.S. reference labs and consumables and continued solid growth in rapid assay sales. U.S. CAG recurring diagnostic growth continues to be primarily volume-driven with price gains trending in the 2% range overall. U.S. recurring CAG Diagnostic customer retention metrics are sustaining at very high levels, supporting our continued strong U.S. growth profile. IDEXX's U.S. recurring CAG growth performance outpaced solid U.S. veterinary practice market growth reflected in our data set from approximately 7,500 clinics. In Q2, patient visits were up 1.5% and clinic revenues increased 5.7% compared to the prior-year period. International revenues in Q2 were $224 million, up 11% organically. International results were driven by 15% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. This reflected very high consumable revenue gains, over 20% year-on-year in the quarter, supported by our expanding Catalyst instrument base, increasing chemistry utilization and new test adoption. We also saw continued solid gains in European lab revenues in Q2. In terms of segment performance, our Q2 results were supported by global gains across CAG Diagnostic testing modalities and rapid expansion of our premium instrument base. Globally, we placed 3,241 premium analyzers, up 21% compared to prior-year levels, reflecting 11% growth in North America and 30% gains in international markets. These results were driven by 1,651 Catalyst placements, a 39% year-on-year increase, and continued strong momentum in SediVue with 716 placements in the quarter. Since our launch in early 2016, we've now installed over 5,200 SediVues globally. We also placed 874 premium hematology instruments globally in the quarter. In addition to these strong premium instrument results, we placed 1,344 SNAP Pros in Q2, expanding our SNAP Pro installed base to over 21,500 with nearly 20,000 installed in North America. Strong Catalyst performance in Q2 was supported by 1,200 placements in international markets, up 55% year-on-year, reflecting significant progress in upgrading our VetTest installed base and strong growth in placements at new and competitive accounts. Globally, we placed 784 Catalysts at new or competitive accounts in the quarter, up 14% year-on-year. Consistent with our strategic focus, 346 instruments or 77% of North American Catalyst placements were at new or competitive accounts. Our EVI index for premium instruments was up solidly in North America in Q2, supported by Catalyst gains and 32% year-on-year growth in SediVue placements, both benefiting from our multi-modality IDEXX 360 program, which continues to gain traction with customers. The use of EVI is also sharpening our focus in the international market, supporting the outstanding Catalyst placement growth results in the quarter. CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues in Q2 were $35 million, up 22% organically, including $9 million of revenues attributed to the accounting standard change, which now more closely aligns instrument revenue recognition with the timing of the instrument placement. Consistent with our first quarter results, this amount was primarily related to the launch of the IDEXX 360 customer program in the U.S. Benefits from an expanding instrument base, the innovation that we brought to market in recent years and our expanded direct commercial capability continue to drive strong recurring CAG Diagnostic revenue gains. Instrument consumable revenues of $159 million grew 18% organically in Q2. Results reflected strong double-digit organic gains across U.S. and international markets. Adoption of our greenfield innovation continues to build with SediVue and SDMA-on-a-slide each contributing approximately 2% to year-on-year consumable revenue gains in the quarter. Reference laboratory and consulting services with revenues of $197 million grew 13% organically in the second quarter. U.S. lab momentum is very strong, reflected in continued mid-teen volume-driven organic reference lab revenue gains and record high customer retention levels, now over 97%. We also achieved continued high single-digit organic lab growth in international markets, supported by higher gains in Europe. Rapid assay revenues of $63 million grew 4% organically in Q2 with similar gains in U.S. and international markets. Solid rapid assay growth was driven by continued expansion of 4Dx Plus, specialty and first generation products. Turning to the P&L, operating profit in Q2 was $146 million, up 19% as reported or 17% on a constant currency basis, driven by high profit growth in our CAG and Water businesses. Operating margins were 25.1%, up 110 basis points on a constant currency basis, aided by operating expense leverage on our strong revenue growth results in the quarter. Relative to our expectations, we saw some favorability related to timing of OpEx investments, which supported our strong Q2 operating margins. These benefits are reflected in our raised full year operating margin guidance. Gross profit was $332 million in Q2, up 14% as reported or 12% on a constant currency basis. Gross margins of 57.2% decreased 35 basis points on a constant currency basis compared to strong prior-year levels, including about 20 basis points of impact related to cost reclassifications in our lab business from OpEx to cost of revenue. Higher investments in lab information systems and service capacity, employee benefits including the increase in our 401(k) match levels as part of the tax reform reinvestment, as well as mix impacts from high instrument revenue growth offset benefits from solid net price gains and ongoing productivity improvement. Foreign exchange hedge losses, which impact gross profit, were approximately $1 million in Q2. Looking forward, we anticipate relatively more favorable benefits from gross margin leverage in the second half of this year as we lap stepped-up investments in areas like U.S. lab route capacity advanced in the second half of 2017. Operating expenses in Q2 were up 10% or 7.5% on a constant currency basis, resulting in 140 basis points of positive operating expense leverage. Constant currency operating expense increases were driven by higher global sales and marketing and R&D investment, offset in part by the lab cost reclass. As noted in our press release, we're advancing incremental investments in commercial capability in the U.S. and international markets, which will increase the year-on-year growth in operating expenses in the second half of 2018. These investments are factored into our increased full year operating margin improvement goals. EPS in Q2 was $1.23 per share, including $4 million or $0.05 per share in tax benefits related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable constant currency basis, EPS increased 33%, including net benefits from U.S. Tax Reform. Our effective tax rate was 20.9% in Q2, including 3% of tax rate benefit from share-based compensation impacts. Foreign exchange, net of hedge impacts, in Q2 2017 and 2018 increased operating profits by $2 million and EPS by $0.02 per share. Free cash flow was $102 million for the first half of 2018. We continue to maintain our full year outlook for capital spending at about $140 million. This outlook includes about $50 million of combined incremental capital spending related to our Westbrook, Maine headquarters expansion and our German core lab relocation, or about 15% of net income. We're now expecting free cash flow of approximately 70% to 75% of net income for 2018, reflecting these investments, and additional projected cash deployment related to strong program instrument placements. These program instrument outlays are directly related to supporting the expansion of our highly durable CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and yield high incremental returns on invested capital. We allocated $106 million in capital to the repurchase of 500,000 shares in Q2. Year-to-date, we repurchased 1 million shares at an average price of $195 per share while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We ended Q2 with $1.043 billion in debt, $175 million in cash and $412 million in capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 1.84 times gross and 1.53 times net of cash. We're refining our 2018 full year outlook for reduction in average shares outstanding from stock repurchases to about 1%, which assumes that we maintain net leverage at 1.5 times EBITDA. We now project annual net interest expense of approximately $35 million, at the lower end of our earlier outlook, reflecting additional benefits from capital structure optimization. In terms of our updated P&L outlook for 2018, as noted, we're refining our full year reported revenue guidance to $2.205 billion to $2.230 billion. This incorporates operational upsides from our higher 11.5% to 12.5% organic growth outlook, including raised expectations for 12.5% to 14% full year organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and flow-through benefits from our strong first half performance in growing premium instrument placements. As noted, these benefits largely offset $20 million to $25 million of negative revenue guidance impact from revised FX assumptions for the year related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. At the revised conversion rate assumptions shown in our press release, we now expect a full year revenue growth benefit of approximately 0.5% to 1% from FX with a 2% reported revenue growth headwind in the second half of 2018. We're raising our 2018 full year EPS guidance by $0.02 per share at midpoint to $4.10 to $4.20 per share, reflecting an outlook for 32% to 36% comparable constant currency EPS growth. As noted, our updated EPS outlook incorporates approximately $0.07 in operational upside related to our higher organic revenue growth outlook and updated expectations for 90 to 130 basis points in full year constant currency operating margin improvement. Our EPS guidance assumes a 2018 effective tax rate of 19% to 20%, a 50 basis point improvement compared to earlier guidance, netting approximately $0.02 of EPS upside. This tax rate includes an updated estimate of $16.5 million to $18.5 million or approximately 4% in full year projected tax rate benefit from exercise of stock-based compensation. At the midpoint of our guidance estimates, this equates to about $0.20 per share in full year benefit. FX impacts align with the foreign exchange rate shown in our press release partially offset these increases to our full year EPS guidance. We now estimate that foreign exchange rate changes will have a $0.01 positive impact on full year EPS or about $0.07 per share below our earlier estimates. Consistent with these assumptions, we estimate net hedge gains and losses will be relatively flat for the full year. In terms of our third quarter outlook, we expect reported revenue growth in the 9.5% to 11% range, supported by organic revenue gains of 11.5% to 13%. We expect Q3 2018 operating margins to increase approximately 100 basis points above prior-year Q3 levels on a constant currency basis as we ramp our commercial investments. In terms of FX impacts, in addition to a projected 2% revenue growth headwind, we expect year-on-year FX changes will have a modest negative impact on reported operating margins in Q3. So the reported operating margin improvement will be somewhat below the 100 basis points I noted. We expect our effective tax rate in Q3 to be 19% to 20%, including projected benefits from share-based compensation exercise activity. That concludes the financial review. Overall, our business momentum is very strong and we're on track to significantly over-deliver against our original goals for 2018 financial performance. Let me now turn the call over to Jon for his comments. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Brian, thanks. Let me put those great results in context here. Our strategy is to help veterinarians around the world to grow their appropriate use of diagnostics in the care of the pet, keeping pets healthy and meeting the needs of owners. The current medical standards practice today broadly define a fraction of what they could be with IDEXX's unique toolkit of tests and services assisted by software technologies. In the second quarter, our commercial teams around the world made great progress advancing our strategy, as evidenced by the record Q2 instrument placements and the 13% organic growth in the testing that make up our Companion Animal Group Diagnostic recurring revenues. Commercial successes driven by field presence and ever-growing field productivity drove the results that Brian enumerated. The productivity drivers include our EVI, or economic value index, basis for instrument placements, which has now been adopted globally in 2018; our IDEXX 360 program to grow IDEXX proprietary diagnostics; and our investments in sales force automation. Our advanced CRM helps our field professionals answer the three key questions they face every day : Where do I go? Who do I see? And what do I say? The extensive proprietary real-time data we have integrated into our CRM, Salesforce.com, empowers our consultants to be highly relevant to our customers in supporting their adoption of IDEXX innovations and advancing their practices. Our IDEXX 3 (sic) [IDEXX 360] (20:41) program has already shown significant successes in the North American market, evidenced by the second quarter performance of 346 Catalyst placements to new and competitive accounts and 650 SediVue placements, up 32% year-over-year. We will be implementing the IDEXX 360 program in major international markets over the next six months. We expect this customer-friendly program will advance instrument placements further and support the enduring growth of IDEXX's diagnostic recurring revenues. A key feature of IDEXX 360 is that the customer can meet their diagnostic growth commitments by testing where they want; in-house or reference labs; and what they want. In addition, customers' adoptions of IDEXX's new and unique test further support their revenue commitments to IDEXX, while growing the adoption of these unique test innovations. Our success' momentum and increasing productivity of our sales and marketing team combined with the market opportunity of our unique offering gives us confidence to expand our commercial presence yet again in the second half of 2018. In the U.S., we are already underway with 13% expansion in our field-based professionals, which we expect to be fully in place and in territory by the beginning of Q4 2018. This will bring us to an estimated 490 field-based professionals, up from 435 in Q1. When we expand our presence in the field, each IDEXX professional is able to spend more time with each customer and, thus, our relationships with each customer deepens further. We have consistently found quite simply the more we call on customers, the faster they grow with IDEXX. We also know customers who use IDEXX for their in-house and reference labs are larger and grow their revenues faster than practices who do not use IDEXX for either. So, the deeper presence will help us with instrument placements, including the novel SediVue Dx for urinalysis, grow usage of our proprietary assays and technologies, such as SDMA and VetConnect PLUS, increase customer loyalty and retention, and support the growth of IDEXX's unique strategy to advance preventative care testing at the reference lab, what we call the Preventative Care Challenge, leveraging IDEXX's unique expanded test menu. Note that we are pleased to see over 20,000 U.S. customers now use IDEXX reference labs, an all-time high, in Q2 of 2018, a level never achieved before in this most basic metric of IDEXX market presence. Our successes outside the U.S. market have led us to the same conclusion. There is a strong ROI for IDEXX when we invest in a disciplined expansion of our field professional presence. And so, in the second half of 2018, we are embarking on growth in our field presence in targeted country markets where we see the greatest opportunity. These expansions range from 20% to 100% in field-based professionals depending on the targeted country. Overall, outside the U.S., we are planning to increase our field-based presence to 390 professionals, up 15% from 340 at the end of 2017. This does not include increases in supporting personnel, including phone-based and marketing staff. So, in total, our global field-based presence with professionals in the field who are experts in diagnostics and software supporting our customers will be an estimated 880 by the end of 2018. Internationally, we've also been moving our sales structures to customer-centric model, similar to the one we put in place in North America a few years ago and to great effect. Key markets where we have a strong in-house and reference lab with a direct sales approach, such as Australia, Japan, the Nordics and Germany have already moved to this structure over the past couple of years. Germany in its second quarter in the new structure saw very strong instrument placements with Catalyst placements up 75% year-over-year and strong reference lab organic growth. The UK will move to this account model at the beginning of 2019, the last major market to do so within the IDEXX international portfolio. These initiatives will help us further develop the unique innovations that we have brought to the market in the last two to four years, which cumulatively have created a highly differentiated portfolio of instruments, rapid assays and reference lab services. The 13% growth that we are achieving is coming primarily from the core portfolio of tests and services that make up our Companion Animal Group Diagnostic recurring revenues, with smaller benefits from new products launched within the last 12 months. These smaller products contributed about 0.5% to organic growth in Q4. This momentum, augmented with our expanded global commercial presence, gives us high confidence we can sustain high growth in the Companion Animal Group recurring revenues as we move forward. We'd like to provide an update on our new test innovations. In July, we have launched the Catalyst SDMA T4 combo kit in North America, which follows earlier launches of Catalyst CRP and Catalyst SDMA contributing to the growing IDEXX proprietary in-house testing menu. Most of the international markets will follow with the SDMA T4 combo kit launch within the next two months. This test innovation will further advance SDMA adoption on Catalyst as well as grow T4 utilization with all the benefits to customer retention, new customer acquisition, consumable revenue growth per customer that we have discussed in the past. Looking forward, we are reassessing our SNAP Fecal product currently in development. We believe we have more work to do than initially appreciated to bring a fecal SNAP to the field with the level of outstanding sensitivity and specificity that we are currently able to deliver with the reference lab Fecal Dx offering. At this time, we're not in a position to provide a targeted launch date. We don't anticipate this change will impact either our 2018 or 2019 revenue growth plans, given the large number of current growth drivers already in play in our North American Companion Animal Group commercial operations. Our commercial focus in the fecal testing category will be building on the tremendous success we are experiencing with our proprietary fecal antigen reference lab offering, Fecal Dx. Our unique technology for both routine and sick animal intestinal parasite screening and testing in our reference lab offering finds more disease and finds it earlier in the infection cycle than just the traditional microscopy approach. Fecal Dx is also a key piece of our proprietary Preventative Care Challenge that is appropriate for all life stages of the dog and cat. Combined with Lab 4Dx, a chemistry panel with an IDEXX SDMA and the unique aspects of the IDEXX CBC, we have assembled a comprehensive screen for the seemingly well patient to uncover underlying diseases that are impacting pet health and well-being and which can be addressed with a treatment plan. We're finding that advancing the appropriate case for preventative care testing using IDEXX proprietary panels in the reference labs is a long-term growth driver for the reference lab volumes in our existing customers in the U.S. The Preventative Care Challenge really defines what IDEXX is all about : serving the pet, pet owner and veterinarian alike. We also continue to add to our capability in providing solutions to veterinary practices to support the management of their business. Of note, our veterinary software and services business has just gotten stronger with the recent acquisition of Smart Flow just after the quarter ended. Virtually every paper formed in the veterinary practice can be captured electronically using Smart Flow, enabling a truly paperless practice and, importantly, ensuring all service charges are captured and added to the invoice, improving both practice efficiency and revenue and profitability. Smart Flow is a very innovative treatment workflow enhancement to the core practice management software system, such as Cornerstone, and provide a high ROI due to its impact on productivity and the plugging of revenue leaks from hospital charges not captured. Quite similar to what IDEXX has done with diagnostic integration in VetConnect PLUS, Smart Flow also enhances IDEXX's overall software offering to our customers who need enterprise IT solutions. Practices with enterprise needs currently consist of about 10% to 15% of the global market. Wrapping up, the market, our strategy and our execution in the field is driving strong growth in our Companion Animal Group Diagnostic recurring revenue with Q2 organic growth of 13%. These recurring revenues contribute an estimated 75% of our overall IDEXX revenue, so a core enduring growth driver. We are advancing a software strategy that builds on key elements of our strategy to accelerate customer growth and loyalty. Our raised organic growth for 2018 is reflective of strong momentum we are building in our businesses, position us to continue to deliver on our long-term revenue and profit goals. So, in summary, all of us at IDEXX remain dedicated to our purpose \u2013 to create exceptional long-term value for our customers, employees and shareholders by enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock. And with that, we'll open it up to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. Question will come from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Hey, Mike. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks for taking the call. A couple of quick questions. One, I just wanted a little more clarity on what you just talked about, Jon, with fecal SNAP. You mentioned previously it was expected in the summer of 2018 and on the last call, you said it was more about workflow and some of the earlier response you got from the early users on just optimizing the workflow. So I want to get a little bit more clarity on what has changed since then and why this additional change to the fecal. And then a quick follow-up on the sales force expansion. You highlighted some of the international markets you're going. But in the United States, for example, is there any territory reshuffling associated with this or is this more just in each territory additional sales force and also timing on how long you expect for those to get up to speed, three, six months things like that? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, thank you. On the fecal offering, we've been so successful with the proprietary antigen-based technology in the reference lab, combining it with core blood work, IDEXX Chemistry with SDMA and CBC. And that fecal offering is going to \u2013 it's an outstanding level of sensitivity and specificity. And by the way, it's going to advance further when we adopt the Applied BioCode, which is the technology we announced earlier in 2018. And so, in that context, we are continuing to evaluate the customer requirements we need for an in-house screening test for SNAP. And you heard all the investments that Brian mentioned that we're \u2013 in expanding our reference lab, our presence, our information systems and the field expansion, we're really going to be focusing on the reference lab side of the fecal testing in 2019. And as I mentioned, that wasn't a product that was even planned until 2019 and we don't think the change in our outlook here changes, of course, either 2018 or 2019 growth prospects. With regard to the U.S. expansion, we've already actually hired the majority of the people as of now, as part of that expansion and they're in training and in the field. There's always a small reconfiguration of the territories when you do an expansion by definition because we're adding more territories. That will take place in Q4. Typically, it takes a quarter for everything to get up to speed, but we have so much momentum and obviously we have a lot of supporting people in those territories, our veterinary diagnostic specialists, the instrument specialists, the professional service veterinarians that we \u2013 and this is the third \u2013 actually, this is the third expansion of this nature that we have done. So we're really down the learning curve on how to do this smoothly with the field. So that's going to be fully in place towards the end of the year and obviously preparing for 2019. Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Appreciate it. Look forward to seeing you at the Analyst Day. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Jon, seems like an important data point is the upped investment internationally with growing the customer-facing organization. Can you talk a little bit more about what's driving that? Is that increased demand for diagnostics that you're seeing opening up the market? Is it the company's success rolling out EVI or 360 that gives you the comfort? Or is it investment ahead of potential competitors maybe increasing their investments in the market? Just what's really driving that because it seems like a pretty big uptick? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you very much. We're very, very excited about the international expansion. And you're right, that is a new data point on the call and noteworthy that we're talking about and it's really the fact that we've had just tremendous success internationally with our instrument business, Catalyst placements outside of North America up 55% in the second quarter. And we've only started to achieve the benefits of EVI. We haven't even started with IDEXX 360. And we're really early days on leveraging the productivity benefits of sales force automation, all of which working together increases the productivity of our investment. And so given the market opportunity that we've laid out in past discussions and we'll reinforce in the Investor Day in a couple of weeks, we just see the opportunity to be significant. The other point I will make is that we've launched SDMA for Catalyst internationally in the second quarter and it's unbelievable what the take-up is. We have 50% of Catalyst customers outside the U.S. who purchased the SDMA slide. This is amazing because we've only been in the market a couple months. It's faster take-up in the U.S. I think these international markets, our teams have done a great job and they're more medically-centric, believe it or not, than the U.S. and we don't even have reference labs in a lot of these \u2013 in some of these markets that we've seen SDMA pick-up or a strong reference lab presence. And so the proprietary nature of our offering, once we get a Catalyst into a customer \u2013 the loyalty of our Catalyst customers outside the U.S. is 99.9% and so we really see the opportunity to double down on growth in these markets around the world. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Very helpful. And given that it is a novel data point, just want to get a little bit more of a reference here. Is the 15% uptick in the customer-facing organization OUS, incremental to what you started with at the start of the year? Or did you have some plans to grow that and now it's higher and you're just talking about this 15% as an overall growth metric? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yes. It is incremental to what we had as our plan going into 2018 and it's really reflective of the exceptional performance that our teams have achieved, the maturity of our management teams and supporting functions. These are disciplined expansions. We don't do these things willy-nilly. We want to do them right. We want to do them in a way that our customers benefit and our organization in an organized fashion. We know how to do this. We've done more of these expansions in the U.S., but we're prepared to take this kind of growth mentality \u2013 augmented growth mentality internationally. So, yeah, this is something that we really \u2013 it was not part of our plans going into 2018, but we feel the ROI is there and that's characteristic of IDEXX. We move very, very fast when we see new opportunities. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, just on the return point, if you look at the incremental growth that we're able to drive as well as the durability of these revenues, the inverse of a 99% retention rate is a very long customer relationship. The return on these investments is several times what we're putting into it. And I think with the 55% instrument growth, over 20% consumable growth, we're really encouraged by the momentum that we have and think this is a great place for us to be spending our time and our resources. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: There's another interesting dynamic, Ryan, on top of everything we're talking about, what we've done in the U.S., we basically upgraded all the VetTests to Catalyst, okay? There is like less than \u2013 I think over 99% of our chemistry consumable revenue in the U.S. is now coming from Catalyst customers. In large part, we aren't as far along, but we're well on our way. 80%, 85% of our chemistry consumable outside the U.S. is coming from Catalyst customers. And so while we continue to upgrade VetTest, we're actually turning our forces towards the new and competitive placements. And we don't have to spend as much time upgrading vet tests because, quite frankly, there are not that many left, and usually they're smaller, they're harder to upgrade. And so we take the same resources and turn them to new and competitive and, of course, that accelerates the consumable growth, which is why we're getting over 20% consumable growth in the international markets in Q2 because we've really turned now to the new and competitive. So it's another reason why we feel good about augmenting our sales organization. Operator : Thank you. We will go to the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thanks. Can you speak to some of the more one-time factors impacting the gross margin in the quarter and the dynamics that are influencing that potential or potentially better trend in the second half? And tied to that, I guess, can you speak to the overall price realization in the quarter and the sustainability of pricing trends in general across reference laboratory, rapid assay as well as VetLab consumables? Thanks. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Sure. Why don't I start with price, Erin? We noted we were at a 2% net price increase in the quarter. It's very consistent with the strategy that we've been advancing. Not a lot of change on that front. I would say, if anything, at the margin, we're just doing really well with new customer acquisition. And so that's a growth-oriented investment that causes a little bit of moderation in the gross to net conversion, but that will come back over time, of course, as we secure those accounts and get the benefits of growth with them over time. In terms of the gross margin dynamics, there are a number of investments that have been flowing through cost of revenue in the first half. Late last year, we really stepped up some investments in our lab route capacity given the mid-teen volume growth that we were seeing in our U.S. labs. We're rolling out and completing the rollout of our global LIMS system implementations that also flows through cost of revenue. We added capacity to our software, services field service rep organization and we had some cost reclassifications. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, 20 basis points of cost reclass. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: That we talked about. And so along with the strong instrument growth, it's all kind of flowing through gross margin at the moment. As we look ahead, we'll start lapping some of those investments, particularly the route capacity and the lab information systems will be moderating in terms of their growth. And so looking ahead to the back half, I made a comment that we'll have more favorable comparison, so our increased operating margin outlook factors that in even as we're advancing these incremental commercial investments. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Great. And then, I guess, the sequential step-up in practice revenue and patient visit growth that you noted based on the metrics you track, I guess, do you think that there was any delay in the flea and tick season that possibly impacted overall visits and influencing your consumables or reference laboratory volume? I guess, what's embedded in your guidance also in terms of that underlying veterinary demand trends in the U.S. in particular and potentially what you saw over the course of the quarter? Thanks Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, thank you. I think with regard to our performance, we're not as dependent on the flea and tick season as maybe other companies that are serving the industry with different categories, but I think it was a slow start to the year, that was probably weather. I think most people said April was a weird month and then May and June were good months. And it's hard to parse this by month, but there's a lot of anecdotal evidence about that, but I think the market is strong. And, as you know, Erin, people love their pets, millennials love their pets even better and it turns out Generation Z may even be beyond millennials. So millennials are moving into their own homes and first thing that comes is a pet. So, they're getting married later, having kids later, but they're getting the pet. So I think the overall market is strong. I think our customer base, those who are using IDEXX and who are regularly working with IDEXX that we're finding this preventative care is a big growth driver and that's one of the things that is driving particularly our reference lab growth in the first half of the year. Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we will go to the line of Jonathan Block from Stifel. Your line is open. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks and good morning. Maybe two and change in terms of questions. Jon, you detailed the actual head count associated with the recent expansion. Where is the approximate U.S. call cycle after this most recent expansion of the sales force? And then, what's the optimal call cycle as you see it after factoring in your level of innovation? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Jon, we get that question all the time. The more we call on customers, the faster they grow with IDEXX. And because the adoption of our innovations is still a fraction of what it could be, the adoption of preventative care is still just really the earliest stages. And the other thing is we are really starting to see huge productivity from our CRM at Salesforce.com. It's pretty impressive. A rep can now basically quickly sort their territory by any number of metrics, for example, adoptions of what customers have purchased SDMA-on-a-slide. And they can sort it and pick the top opportunities, drop it right in the map anything and they got two days of calls on that particular topic. And it's really powerful and it's used by the entire sales management team. That is really \u2013 what we've been doing is building the infrastructure and now we're starting to see the real benefit. So we're going to \u2013 this expansion allows us to make more calls on customers and we expect a good ROI. It's hard for me to say where is the end of this because we're all about advancing the standards of care and that's what we see as the opportunity. And the most mature market in the world, the U.S., is not mature at all. And then we look outside the U.S. and we say if the international market got to the U.S. standard of care, I mean, what would it take? And it turns out it would take 25 years of 10% organic revenue growth to get the U.S. standards of care. And, of course, the U.S. isn't standing still. So, yeah, we have a lot of opportunity in front of us and this is going to increase the call intensity with our customers. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Just to try to quantify a bit, are you some, call it, once a month in terms of your U.S. sales force on how frequently they're currently calling on your customers? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Well, remember, we call customers, everybody out there, whether they're using us or not. Now, most practices use us for something, but not all. So we're calling on them, whether they're using us or not. And I'd say once a month is \u2013 we're going to have some more of those metrics. It's hard to say. Obviously, the big customers that we're calling on far more frequently than once a month and we're calling more than just with the veterinary diagnostic consultant. We've got professional service veterinarians and we've got specialists and we've now got, Brian mentioned as part of the gross margin factor, the investments we're making with field-based, field support reps who help them with their software and this is highly appreciating our customers who have adopted our PIMS and our apps are larger and more loyal and growing faster. And so, yeah, there's a lot of working with the customers and they really appreciate our presence because we're really bringing subject matter expertise. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. I'm not trying to be difficult, but let me ask one more just to be clear, this is still part of the first question. You made a lot of hires. I guess, what I'm trying to get at, by the numbers, it seems like you are calling on much more than once a month. I understand your growth has been highly, highly impressive, but I think what we're all trying to figure out is, is there a point in time where this at least goes a little bit more on auto pilot rather than handholding. So, Jon, just to try get the crux of the question, if you're now at \u2013 I think it was close to 600 reps in North America, what is peak number? Is it 700? Is it 1,200? Is it somewhere in between? Can you give us some context there? And then I promise I'll move on to part two. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I guess, the question is, what is peak growth? We keep accelerating our growth. So we can spend some more time on this on the Analyst Day. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. The second question is really following up on SNAP Fecal. And I know you talked about the pipeline being very robust despite the setback in SNAP Fecal. But a couple of questions here. So, one, I wanted to be clear. Is this product still likely coming to market at some point? I don't think I really knew. And then the $15 million in incremental revenue that I think was supposed to be derived from SNAP Fecal, that could have been 100 to 200 basis points of incremental growth depending on the cadence of those revenues. So what was the point earlier in the call that you're going to find ways to make up some, most, or all of that through the traction that you have at the reference lab? Thanks, guys. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yes, that is our expectation. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That was pretty tight. So I'll ask the last 0.5. With this product seemingly unlikely to hit the market in 2019, a big part of the IDEXX story has been a continual cadence of new products. Should we expect this to be replaced by something else that you may have in the pipeline next year? Thanks, guys. And I'll see you in a couple weeks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: We're going to bring more products to the market next year. They are all different types and sizes and we'll have more to say when we get closer to 2019. I do want to say, though, what we're really benefiting from is the cumulative effect of the advancements in our proprietary test portfolio. And while everybody loves new products, we've got so many new products and so many proprietary advances out there that are still early in the adoption and which bring along all the other diagnostic recurring revenue that the vast majority of our growth is the core growth that comes from the cumulative technology we've brought to the market over the last several years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thank you very much. You reported outstanding consumables growth of 20%. This appears to be the strongest I've seen in a long time. And I guess, Brian, for you, I think you indicated that both SediVue and SDMA in a slide added I believe 2 points to consumable growth in the quarter. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: That's right. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. So that's clarified. And then as we think about \u2013 I know you're not prepared to guide 2019. These products are certainly very early. Should we be thinking about these products as potentially 2 points additive into 2019 as we think about next year? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: So a couple clarifications. Our organic growth in consumables globally was 18%. It was over 20% internationally. These are long adoption cycles. So these products will continue to augment consumable growth in 2019. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I think the way to think about it is consistent to how we've talked in our long-term strategic plan where we highlighted a long-term potential for 9% to 13% recurring CAG growth and we're obviously at the high end of that range right now and incorporated in that were benefits from SDMA, SediVue, other new products, including fecal antigen in labs and which I believe was \u2013 I think we had 0.5 point to 1 point in total from fecal antigen. So these are things that build over time and they all go into the mix. And as Jon pointed out, combined with our commercial approaches and integrated strategy to hitting those growth numbers. So we're not trying to signal that we are adding to that long-term growth potential. We'll talk more about that at Investor Day, but I think we're executing quite well and at the high end of what we've been targeting to achieve and we think with the additional investments we're making, we're looking to build on that momentum and sustain that into the future. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great. And then last quarter you indicated that 42% of your Catalyst installed base had adopted SDMA-on-a-slide. Do you have an updated number on that? And then I think you were hoping to get to maybe somewhere around 60% of your installed base at the end of the year. Is that still maybe on track? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, thank you for that question. The 42% was a U.S. number because we really hadn't launched it internationally. We're right now at 50% globally, which \u2013 sorry, almost 50% \u2013 49% globally. And so we're pretty happy with what the international did. I mean, international is like at 50% and U.S. is at 48%. That averages 49%. So we're really pleased with the progress at this point in the year. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: That's great. And maybe one last quick one. Certainly, a very strong quarter highlighted by organic revenue growth that beat our forecast. Just wanted to ask on the rapid assay piece. Obviously, you do have a competitor on the market in the FLEX4 from Abaxis-Zoetis. Can you just speak to your view on what the pro forma growth rate of that market is? Is that mid-single-digits, high-single-digits? Or can you talk about any competitive dynamics there? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, we achieved a little higher than 5% \u2013 I think we were at 6% in Q1 and 4% organic growth in Q2 in our rapid assay business, which, as you know, is predominantly a North American business, a U.S. business. So that was both in volume and price. There was a new test out there. Always a new test generates some interest. I think the bloom is off the rose on that right now because I think customers appreciate the accuracy and sensitivity of our test. And by the way, that's the reason why you buy these tests and run them is so they find the disease. And when they don't find, customers are realizing, it's pretty obvious, it's not capturing a lot of the disease that the 4Dx is. And so we had to work through that. We're working through that, educating customers every step of the way, and so there was some impact on that certainly in our numbers in the second quarter. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Consistent with what we had baked into our plans this year. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Thanks. Look forward to the Analyst Day. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Operator : Thank you. And our final question will come from the line of David Westenberg with C.L. King. Your line is open. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in. So really excited about the adoption of SDMA in the clinic. Now, I know that no customer is unique and you're going to probably see across the board kind of behaviors. But can you kind of give us a sense on how your customers are adopting? Kind of what percentage of chemistry panels are they adopting, if you can give us that? Or if you can't, maybe can you just give us some anecdotes about how they're using it right now? Just anything right now is helpful in understanding how quick that's going to be adopted. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, thank you very much. It's a great question. So customers are at all different stages of the journey to belief and understanding of the immense clinical value that SDMA adds to a chemistry panel. We have several hundred customers in the U.S. who are well along that journey and including SDMA and the large majority of their panels are running SDMA at a large percentage of what they're running core chemistry panels. But we've got a lot more Catalyst customers than that. So there are people that are partway there, there are people that are just starting that journey. And so this is a change in established doctrine over 50 years. We've made a lot of progress with the reference lab. But I think the availability of Catalyst SDMA is bringing new excitement and I think we're seeing more and more customers, as they get experience with SDMA, they realize it's an essential element of the chemistry panel. We're going to show some really interesting data, some of our big data on the impact that SDMA has at the Analyst Day, David, which I think you'll all find interesting. And this is why we're expanding our field resources because we've got to bring that story to the practice. And it's a great medical story. It's about medical education, and medical education is what advances the adoption of things like SDMA and our other proprietary expanded test menu. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. And just one last question in terms of international. So one of your competitors was acquired by a large company that has international expansion, so can you remind us a little bit about macro outside the U.S., the utilization behavior, how greenfield it is, whether or not somebody else in the market really has an impact in terms of the reach there and what you can do there in terms of the greenfield miss? I know that's not really a word, but just kind of remind us about the international dynamics, please. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, there are greenfield customers. We think outside of North America estimated to over 60,000 opportunities that \u2013 either the small number of remaining VetTest upgrades, competitive analyzers, which we're routinely swapping out by the way, and also the greenfield. Greenfield is probably about a third of that 60,000 and yet it's expanding because these markets are growing. People love their pets worldwide and medicine is advancing and we're a driver to advancing that. So we really do see a lot of growth opportunity globally, which is why we're embarking upon this 15% expansion in our field-based professionals between now and the end of the year when you look at our international field as a whole. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. And I will see you in two weeks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Great. Operator : And with that speakers, I'd like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, thank you. Thank you all for the call. And, again, I want to thank all the IDEXXers who are working hard to achieve our purpose of enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock around the world. It's why we do what we do. And along the way, we're generating a nice return on it, but we just have so much work ahead of us. It's what propels us and we're pleased to be able to share those results with investors and look forward to seeing all of you in person or through the Reg FD Presentation at our Analyst Day in a couple of weeks. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.",

LLC Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Erin Wright - Credit Suisse David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc. Operator : Good morning and welcome to the IDEXX Laboratories third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Participating in the call this morning are : Jon Ayers, Chief Executive Officer; Brian McKeon, Chief Financial Officer; and Kerry Bennett, Vice President, Investor Relations. IDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. In reviewing our third quarter 2018 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth, constant currency growth and comparable constant currency growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2017, unless otherwise noted. To allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit his or her questions to one with one follow-up as necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue, and if time permits we'll take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thanks and good morning, everyone. I appreciate your joining us for our third quarter earnings call. IDEXX delivered strong revenue and profit gains in Q3, keeping us on track towards our full-year goals. Today, I'll take you through our third quarter results and our updated outlook for the full-year 2018. I'll also provide an overview of our preliminary guidance for 2019. Jon will follow with his comments. In terms of highlights for the third quarter, revenues of $545 million grew 11% on a reported basis, net of a 1% foreign exchange growth headwind. Organic revenue gains of 12% continued at a strong pace, driven by 13% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues supported by 13.5% growth in the U.S. Overall organic revenue growth was slightly below our midpoint projections for the quarter, reflecting moderated growth in international reference lab revenues impacted in part by hot weather conditions in Europe. Operating profit of $117 million increased 17% as reported and 20% on a constant currency basis, reflecting continued high organic revenue growth and a 140 basis point constant currency improvement in operating margins. EPS was $1.05 per share, an increase of 39% on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting strong operating profit gains and benefits from U.S. Tax Reform. Reported EPS results also benefited by approximately $0.08 per share from share-based compensation tax benefits that were approximately $0.05 above our expectations for the quarter, reflecting earlier timing of exercises. In terms of our 2018 outlook, we're updating our full-year revenue guidance to $2.205 billion to $2.215 billion based on an outlook for 11.5% to 12% organic revenue gains and updated estimates for FX impacts. In terms of our outlook, we expect to deliver a full-year organic growth trend \u2013 growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, in line with our year-to-date trend of 13.2%, supported by continued strong growth trends in the U.S. and an expanding international consumable revenues. We're pulling down the high end of our most recent projected overall organic growth range by 0.5% to reflect expectations for near-term pressures on LPD revenues and tough Q4 comparisons for instrument placements as well as updated expectations for international lab growth, which will constrain the additional CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth acceleration we targeted for the second of this year. We're refining our 2018 EPS guidance to $4.16 to $4.21, or 33% to 35% growth on a comparable constant currently basis, a $0.04 per share increase at midpoint reflecting $0.01 per share increase for operational performance, supported by our expectations for operating margin gains at the high end of our previous guidance range and $0.03 of upside related to higher projections for share-based compensation tax benefits. In terms of our 2019 preliminary outlook, we're projecting revenue of $2.385 billion to $2.425 billion, supported by organic revenue growth of 9.5% to 11%, and EPS of $4.61 to $4.75 per share resulting in comparable constant currency EPS growth of 15% to 18%, aligned with our long-term financial goals. Our organic revenue growth outlook reflects expectations for a sustained strong CAG Diagnostic recurring organic revenue growth of 11.5% to 12.5%, in line with 2018 trends adjusted for the approximately 1% in non-recurring growth rate benefit from the new revenue accounting standard change. Our EPS outlook incorporates $0.03 per share in projected headwinds from FX and expectations for $0.10 to $0.13 per share in lower tax benefits from share-based compensation activity in 2019, which we'll review in more detail in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our Q3 performance by segment and region. Strong Q3 results were driven by ongoing momentum in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were $478 million, up 13% organically, reflecting continued strong gains in recurring CAG Diagnostic revenues. Global CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 13% organically, including a $5 million or approximately 1% in growth rate benefit from the new revenue accounting standard changes, primarily related to our modified retrospective restatement. Veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems revenues also increased 13% organically. These results were supported by solid growth in recurring software services associated with our practice management platforms and continued strength in our diagnostic imaging business, reflected in a 29% increase in diagnostic imaging system unit placements. Out Water business revenues grew 9% organically in the third quarter to $33 million, supported by solid growth in the U.S. and double-digit gains in international regions, including very strong growth in Brazil. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue in Q3 was $29 million, up 7% organically. Quarterly growth was aided by favorable comparisons to low prior-year revenues related to health herd (sic) [herd health] screening of export cattle into China. Gains in poultry revenues were offset by end market impacts related to African swine fever outbreaks in China, which is our largest market for swine diagnostic testing. We also continue to see impacts from lower milk prices in key markets, which is constraining dairy testing and bovine pregnancy test sales. Given these factors, we expect flat to modest declines in LPD organic revenues for the full-year 2018 with mid to high single-digit revenue declines projected for the fourth quarter. By region, U.S. revenues were $341 million in the quarter, up 13% organically, driven by a 13.5% increase in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. U.S. recurring revenue gains were supported by mid-teen revenue growth in U.S. reference labs and consumables and continued solid growth in rapid assay sales. U.S. CAG recurring diagnostic growth was primarily volume-driven with overall net price gains continuing to trend in the 2% to 3% range. Our U.S. recurring CAG Diagnostic customer retention metrics also sustained at very high levels, supported by steadily increasing levels of customers under long-term contracts. IDEXX's U.S. recurring CAG growth performance continues to significantly outpace solid overall U.S. veterinary practice market growth, reflected in our data set from about 5,000 clinics. In Q3, patient visits were up 1% and clinic revenues increased 5% compared to the prior-year period. International revenues in Q3 were $205 million, up 10% organically. International results were supported by 12% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. These results continue to be driven by consumable revenue gains of over 20%, reflecting expansion of our Catalyst instrument base and increased utilization and adoption of new tests, including SDMA. We're benefiting from our focus on high economic value placements in international regions, which drove a 36% increase in placements at new or competitive accounts in Q3. International lab revenue growth moderated to the low to mid-single-digit range in Q3, including slower growth in key European markets, which were impacted by weather conditions which constrained sample volumes sent to our labs in the quarter. Our executional emphasis on driving high competitive Catalyst placement growth in international markets has also shifted some sales executional focus from driving international lab business, which we expect will contribute to mid to high single-digit international lab revenue growth in the near term, which is factored into our refined growth outlook. In terms of segment performance, our Q3 results benefited from ongoing global expansion of our Catalyst and SediVue instrument base. Globally, we placed 3,026 premium analyzers, up 10%, supported by 20% growth in North America, which benefited from a favorable comparison to relatively moderated placement gains in last year's third quarter as we implemented our 2017 U.S. field sales expansion. Our focus on high economic placements drove a 26% global increase in global Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts and strong double-digit EVI gains in both North America and international. As expected, our focus on high economic placements shifted some emphasis from chemistry upgrades and hematology instrument placements in the quarter, which constrained overall international premium placement growth to 4% compared to very strong prior-year levels. Globally, we placed 1,611 Catalysts in total in Q3, a 16% year-on-year increase, and 821 premium hematology instruments globally, down 3% year on year. We achieved 922 Catalyst placements at new or competitive accounts in Q3, or 57% of total. In North America, we placed 319 Catalyst placements at new or competitive accounts, or 75% of total. This represented a 10% year-on-year increase, with 15% gains in the U.S. As noted, international Catalyst placements at new or competitive accounts increased 36% year on year in Q3. We also drove strong continued momentum with SediVue, reflected in 594 global placements or 18% growth, driven by 30% year-on-year growth in North America. In addition to these strong premium instrument results, we placed 1,495 SNAP Pros in Q3 globally, expanding our SNAP Pro installed base to almost 23,000. Overall CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues in Q3 were $32 million, up 10% organically, including $7 million in revenues attributed to the accounting standard change, which now more closely aligns instrument revenue recognition with the timing of the instrument placement. This amount is primarily related to the launch of the IDEXX 360 customer program in the U.S. Our expanding instrument base and benefits from new test innovation continues to drive strong recurring CAG Diagnostic revenue gains. Instrument consumable revenues of $153 million grew 19% organically in Q3. Results reflected continued strong gains in international markets and accelerated double-digit growth in the U.S. High volume-driven consumable gains were supported by expansion of SediVue Pay per Run and SDMA slide revenues, which contributed approximately 4% combined to year-on-year consumable revenue gains in the quarter. Reference laboratory and consulting services with revenues of $184 million grew 11% organically in the third quarter. U.S. lab momentum remains very strong, reflected in mid-teen volume-driven organic reference lab revenue gains. As noted, overall lab revenue growth was moderated by low to mid-single-digit gains in international markets. Rapid assay revenues at $54 million grew 6% organically in Q3, reflecting solid gains across U.S. and international markets. Rapid assay gains were primarily volume-driven, reflecting continued growth of 4Dx Plus, specialty, and first-generation products. Turning to the P&L, operating profit in Q3 was $117 million, up 17% as reported or 20% on a constant currency basis, with results driven by continued high profit growth in our CAG business. Operating margins were 21.5%, up 110 basis points as reported and 140 basis points on a constant currency basis. Gross profit of $306 million in Q3 was up 12% as reported or 13% on a constant currency basis. Gross margins of 56% increased approximately 40 basis points on a constant currency basis compared to prior-year levels, net of approximately 25 basis points of negative impact related to cost reclassifications in our lab business from OpEx to cost of revenue. Gross margin expansion was driven by lower product costs in LPD and VetLab consumables, solid price gains and benefits from high consumable growth. Overall gross margin gains were moderated by investments in lab service capacity and employee benefits, including the increase in our 401(k) match levels as part of the Tax Reform reinvestment, as well as unfavorable impacts related to instrument program mix under the new revenue accounting standard. Foreign exchange hedge gains which benefit gross profit were limited in Q3. Operating expenses in the quarter increased 8% on a reported and 9% on a constant currency basis, resulting in approximately 100 basis points of positive operating expense leverage. Constant currency operating expense increases were driven by higher global sales and marketing investment and higher G&A costs in the quarter, offset in part by the lab cost reclass. We incurred a $2.6 million impairment of work in progress assets related to the SNAP Fecal product in Q3, which was recorded in G&A, which was offset by favorable changes in other accruals. As noted, EPS in Q3 was $1.05 per share, including $7 million or approximately 8% per share in tax benefits related to share-based compensation activity, which as noted was about $0.05 per share above our expectations. On a comparable constant currency basis, EPS increased 39%, including benefits from U.S. Tax Reform. Our effective tax rate was 14.5% in Q3, including approximately 6% of tax rate benefit from share-based compensation impacts. Foreign exchange net of hedge impacts in Q3 2017 and 2018 decreased operating profit by $3 million and EPS by $0.03 per share. Year-to-date free cash flow was $182 million. We continue to expect free cash flow of about 70% to 75% of net income for 2018. This reflects a consistent outlook for full-year capital spending of $140 million, including approximately $50 million of combined incremental capital spending related to our Westbrook, Maine headquarter expansion and our German core lab relocation, as well as additional projected cash deployment related to strong program instrument placements. Our strong cash flow generation supported the allocation of $73 million in capital towards the repurchase of 300,000 shares in the quarter. Year-to-date we've repurchased 1.3 million shares at an average price of $207 per share, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. We ended Q3 with $1.022 billion in debt, $147 million in cash, and $435 million in capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 1.74 times gross and 1.49 times net of cash. We continue to maintain a 2018 full-year outlook for a reduction in average shares outstanding from stock repurchases of approximately 1%, which assumes that we maintain net leverage at 1.5 times EBITDA. We now are projecting annual net interest expense of $34 million to $35 million reflecting additional benefits from capital structure optimization. In terms of our updated P&L outlook for 2018, as noted, we're refining our full-year reported revenue guidance to $2.205 billion to $2.215 billion, reflecting an organic growth outlook of 11.5% to 12%. This reflects a full-year outlook for CAG Diagnostic organic revenue growth in line with our strong year-to-date trends, which include about 1% of growth benefit related to the implementation of the New Revenue Standard. For the full year, we now expect a 0.5% reported revenue growth benefit from foreign exchange, slightly less favorable than earlier estimates, as the recent strengthening of the dollar offsets first half gains. Our updated overall organic growth outlook lowers the high end of our prior guidance range of 11.5% to 12.5% by 0.5%. As noted, we're planning for near-term pressure on our LPD business related to end market factors, impact of swine testing in China, and dairy testing globally. We've also factored in expectations for moderated growth in our international lab business, which will constrain the additional acceleration in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth that we had targeted for the second half of 2018. For the fourth quarter, we expect reported revenue growth in the 7% and 9% range, net of an estimated 2% FX headwind. We expect to sustain high recurring CAG Diagnostic revenue gains in Q4, supported by continued strong U.S. trends. We are projecting a moderation in overall organic growth to the 9% to 11% range related to tough prior year comparisons in global instrument placements and expectations for lower revenues in our LPD business. In terms of EPS, we're raising our 2018 full-year guidance by $0.04 per share at midpoint to $4.16 to $4.21 and narrowing our projected EPS range to reflect an outlook for 33% to 35% comparable constant currency EPS growth. This outlook incorporates expectations for 110 to 130 basis points in full-year constant currency operating margin improvement at the higher end of our prior guidance range, which supports approximately $0.01 per share in operational improvement at midpoint. Our EPS guidance assumes $0.01 in full-year benefit related to FX changes, net of hedge impacts, in line with earlier estimates. Our updated EPS guidance assumes a 2018 effective tax rate of 18% to 18.5%, a 100 to 150 basis point improvement compared to earlier guidance, netting approximately $0.03 of EPS upside. This tax rate includes an updated estimate of approximately $21 million or about 5% in full-year projected tax rate benefit from exercise of share-based compensation. At the midpoint of our guidance estimates, this equates to about $0.23 per share in full-year benefit. This level of benefit is much higher than we have previously expected for this year and reflects increased realized benefits related to the rapid appreciation of IDEXX's stock price, including earlier timing of exercises. As we'll discuss in our preliminary guidance for 2019, we anticipate that about 10% to 13% (sic) [$0.10 to $0.13] (00:20:34) per share of the EPS tax benefit we've realized this year will not carry over into 2019. As we look ahead to 2019, we're targeting continued strong revenue and profit growth consistent with our stated long-term goals. Our preliminary revenue outlook is $2.385 billion to $2.425 billion, reflecting expectations for 9.5% to 11% organic revenue gains, supported by 11.5% to 12.5% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Note that our 2019 results will now be fully comparable under the New Revenue Standard, which we estimate will provide about 1% of growth rate benefit to CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues in 2018 that will not recur in 2019. Our guidance reflects expectations for overall reported revenue growth of 8% to 9.5%, net of an estimated 1.5% foreign exchange headwind related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our preliminary 2019 EPS guidance of $4.61 to $4.75 per share incorporates expectations for operating margin improvement of 50 to 100 basis points on a constant currency basis, also consistent with our long-term goals. At the rates assumed in our press release, we estimate FX will decrease revenue growth by about 1.5% and EPS by $0.03 per share, net of established hedge positions which at current rates would result in approximately $10 million of net pre-tax gains. Our projected 2019 effective tax rate is 20% to 21%. This outlook assumes $9 million to $11 million in share-based compensation tax benefits, assuming our current share price and no change in U.S. tax policy. As noted, this is $0.10 to $0.13 per share below the tax benefits we're projecting in 2018. We're projecting a 1% reduction in shares outstanding related to share repurchases at consistent leverage levels and relatively higher floating interest rate costs which contribute to current projections for net interest expense next year of about $38 million. Adjusting for changes in currency, share-based accounting benefits and discrete tax effects, this 2019 EPS outlook equates to a projected 15% to 18% comparable constant currency growth rate, on track with our long-term goals. Our preliminary 2019 guidance factors in our most recent understanding of tariff-related effects which we currently estimate would have a relatively limited financial impact on IDEXX. This is an area we'll continue to monitor and update in our business plans as we move forward. We look forward to providing an update and more detailed review of our 2019 guidance in our year-end conference call. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the discussion over to Jon for his comments. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Brian, very comprehensive as always. Overall IDEXX's organic growth remains strong, driven by our Companion Animal Diagnostic recurring revenue, which increased 13.1% globally in Q3, including 13.5% growth in the U.S. This diagnostic recurring revenue globally constitutes about 75% of IDEXX's overall revenue. The quality of our instrument placements was strong in the quarter. Globally, we achieved 26% growth in Catalyst placements to new and competitive accounts; important because these placements are the primary driver of our organic instrument revenue \u2013 consumable growth, which was 19.1% globally in Q3. New and competitive Catalysts at 922 units grew 10% in North America and 36% internationally, which is supporting that very strong instrument consumable growth. This reflects our continued focus on the economic value index of different types of instrument placements. EVI is an index of the value to IDEXX of the instrument placement in a particular market that comes from both the instruments and consumables over the many future years. SediVue placements also continued to track in line with our robust plans, at 594 placements, up 18% year-over-year. As part of the multiyear customer agreements under our U.S.-based IDEXX 360 program, SediVue instrument placements also help expand all IDEXX diagnostic revenues. This builds customer retention and allows our field organization to focus on advancing the standard of care through the appropriate use of diagnostics, including adoption of preventative care blood work. We continue to drive mid-teens growth in our U.S. reference lab business, which accounts for almost $7 out of every $10 of our global reference lab revenues. Q3 continues to benefit from fecal testing, up 25% year-over-year in the quarter with the growth in this category of lab testing driven entirely by panels that include our proprietary fecal antigen technology and now in 2018 constitute a majority of our fecal revenues. Fecal testing, along with preventative care blood work, is driving strong same-customer sales growth of reference lab services. European lab growth slowed in Q3, due in part to the heat wave impacting parts of Continental Europe over the summer, which reduced patient sample volumes sent to the reference labs. Also with the introduction of our EVI incentive program to our international commercial organizations this year, while we've seen exceptional instrument placement quality growth year-to-year, as noted, the prioritized focus on instrument placements in our international markets has led to some unforeseen impacts on growth rate of our international reference lab testing services. We are already refining our international execution approach to benefit all of our modalities, including importantly the introduction of our IDEXX 360 program internationally, which has had a highly successful launch in the U.S. at the beginning of this year. Rapid assay test kits with over 80% of revenue coming from the U.S. had an excellent quarter, particularly in line with the launch of a competitive product with SNAP 4Dx earlier in the year. Peer-reviewed research with head-to-head product performance comparisons published in the quarter demonstrates SNAP 4Dx Plus' significant superior ability to detect tick-borne disease compared to the competitive product. Customers tell us unsurprisingly that test accuracy is their highest priority. Accuracy in detecting the test is, after all, the whole point of the test. Our commercial team is doing a great job getting the results of these peer-reviewed research to our customers as they make their purchasing decisions. Overall customer retention trends in the U.S. continue at world-class levels of 97% to 98%. And as customers adopt, use and value our unique innovations, including but not limited to SDMA, including Catalyst SDMA, SediVue, fecal antigen, VetConnect PLUS, software integrations and the differentiated IDEXX 360 program, and we know our customers value the IDEXX diagnostic professionals who visit their practices. As a result, we see continued solid net price realization in the U.S. diagnostics market in the 2% to 3% range. Customer retention outside the U.S. is even higher at 98% to as high as 99.9%, supporting similar solid net price gains. We're on track with our field-based expansions. The U.S. 2018 expansion is complete and we have transitioned to the larger number of territories in Q4, thus shrinking the number of customers covered by a veterinary diagnostic consultant. As a result of our 13% expansion in field-based resources, there's always some adjustments when territories are redrawn. Although with the experience of two prior expansions under our belt, we're getting even better at the transition process in the U.S. Regardless, we have a strong instrument placement compare from Q4 of 2017. And so, while we expect a strong Q4 2018 instrument placement quarter in the U.S., the year-over-year growth of Q4 placements will reflect both the transitional impacts of the U.S. expansion and a tough compare. Internationally, our plan is to have the expansion completed in early 2019 when we're on track to have over 400 field-based professionals. These global field expansions, the ongoing momentum in the U.S. and the continued high potential for growth we see in international markets gives us confidence in our preliminary outlook of 11.5% to 12.5% organic growth of our Companion Animal Group Diagnostic recurring revenue in 2019, consistent with 2018 trends adjusting for the 1% New Revenue Standard growth benefit in 2018. I want to recognize the exceptional Companion Animal Group performance in Q3 of our international teams in Germany, Spain, Netherlands, the four Nordic countries, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, China, Japan and Southeast Asia. These commercial teams show us how international as a whole can advance the adoption of IDEXX innovations to help pets and vet practices all over the world. A couple of other notes. Our digital imaging business had an exceptional Q3, building on our Lower the Dose campaign, leveraging our unique digital radiography offering that reduces radiation exposure by veterinary technicians. Q3 and year-to-date performance of digital radiography placements growth rate is in the high-20s percent with Q4 order rate trends also looking very strong as we begin to lap some tougher year-over-year compares. Our Water business also continues to achieve impressive organic revenue growth of 9% in Q3 due to commercial and innovation investments worldwide. We continue to make steady progress in building our Legiolert franchise in the Water business, which contributed 1% to revenue growth in the quarter. Our Legiolert product has a long runway of growth opportunity over the next few decades. Water's year-to-date organic growth of 10%, operating margins of 46%, limited investment capital and world-class levels of customer retention above 90% make the Water business and the team truly exceptional. Overall, our business trends are strong and our revenue performance is on track with our longer-term goals which is reflected in our 2019 guidance. We are proud to have built a business model with enduring and predictable growth and profit dynamics. Perhaps, this is why we are part of a small minority of companies that provides earning guidance in the Q3 call for the next calendar year. Note that this has been our practice for every year for the last 15. And further, we have an unbroken track record of subsequently delivering within or above that next year's earning guidance range on an adjusted constant currency basis, quite a 15-year record; perhaps unique and a testament to our business model and our team focused on innovation and the customer in delivering financial returns. And I'm deeply proud of them. So, we'll open it up to questions now. Operator : Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. My first one for you just on the international lab growth, can you speak to a little bit more detail there in regards to your comfort that there's no competitive changes? I know you mentioned the weather, you mentioned some sales force focus on instrument placements which makes sense given the recurring nature of that and the high margin there. But any other color you can have on maybe how much was weather related, how much was the sales force refocus, and then what the retention rates were in regards to clients OUS? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yes, thank you for the question, Ryan. The retention rates remain exceptional in the international reference lab business as a whole. So, we really don't say that was a factor. I think it's probably a roughly equal parts weather which impacted Continental Europe where we have a lot of reference lab business, of course, out of our German core lab network; and part, the executional focus, obviously, the 36% year-over-year growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements which drove over 20% growth in the instrument consumable revenue, very profitable revenue for us, was a good aspect of our international performance. And as we move forward and we're introducing the IDEXX 360 program which just really wraps in all of the modalities, this is something that the international organization has just started to adopt. And I think we'll build a competencies and merit area as we complete the commercial expansion through the end of the year and should bode well for 2019 CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue in the international market which we've targeted generally at the 12% to 16% range. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And, Ryan, just to Jon's point on some of the impact being weather, we've seen an improvement early in Q4 relative to some of the trends we saw in the summer. So, that's clearly was part of the dynamic. But I think the executional shift that they create, it's prudent in the near term for us to have that mid- to high-single-digit growth rate overall in Q4. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. And then as my follow-up, maybe a bit too nuance, Brian, but looks like sales and marketing at about $95 million was actually down on a sequential basis, which doesn't appear to be seasonal looking back over the last few years and somewhat surprising given the sales force investments you're making, so anything nuance there to explain why that actually took a downtick in the third quarter. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Sometimes we can have just the charges or reversal in charges that impact those areas. We're on track for the additions that we had talked about in the U.S. expansion. And I think that's reflected in the year-on-year growth, which was high single digit. And I think that's more indicative of how we're managing it there. There can always be some noise quarter to quarter. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Also, I don't know if it's on an absolute basis, obviously, the dollar strengthened in the third quarter. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: That's a good point, Jon. There were some changes in the reported numbers related to FX. Ryan S. Daniels - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks. I'll hop back in the queue. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hello, good morning. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Good morning. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Good morning. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, just one broad question. I'm getting this across my overall coverage universe. There's a lot of concern about slowing in the consumer markets and macro concerns going on. Obviously, your 2019 guide doesn't seem to imply that you're worried about the market. But I guess could you just talk about the broader overall landscape on what you're seeing? And I guess what are you looking for in terms of economic indicators and stuff that get you worried? And I have a follow-up. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: We have a very strong business in the U.S.; obviously, a very large part of the global IDEXX revenues. We're very effective in creating our own growth. I think in general, our diagnostic recurring revenue has grown 800 basis points higher than nominal personal consumption expenditures. And that's been expanding over the last many years, as we have gotten people to really appreciate the importance of blood work and care. One thing we talked about, Derik, as you recall in the Investor Day, was preventative care. It's really interesting. There's just a deep well there. We have about \u2013 a little over 2,000 customers who have adopted our Preventative Care Challenge program. These customers are growing their IDEXX diagnostics revenue at 16% on average. That's over 2,000 customers, and yet that's less than 10% of our total customers. So that's driving very strong same-store sales growth. And that's a result of the commercial investments we're making. And so it's these kinds of efforts which I think have allowed us to actually expand the differential between our recurring growth and nominal PCE in the U.S. And we're seeing \u2013 obviously the economy certainly didn't affect our 36% year-over-year growth in instrument placements across international markets. And you noted the diverse set of countries that I mentioned. And so we're pretty diversified there. So we're not going to say we're completely immune to the economy, but we're very confident. If you look back along the 15 years, we may have had a recession somewhere in the past, and yet we've delivered on our earnings guidance that we give in the following year, which I've mentioned is a relatively small number of companies actually provides 2019 guidance. And we've delivered every year, including in 2007, 2008, and 2009. Each year we gave guidance the October of the year before that year, and we've delivered within or above on constant currency adjusted earnings basis on those, which really shows on that guidance which really shows the enduring predictability of the business model. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, and then just one follow-up. If I heard you correctly, you said that your U.S. sales force expansion was done and that I'm just curious on the international push and how much more you're going to spend incrementally on the international sales force. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: So our international is on its way. It's going to build over Q3, Q4, and early into 2019, and so the international group are hard at work on that. And so I saw that the numbers are all factored into our guidance obviously. When you're growing at double-digit rates, even with the issues in the international reference lab growth in Q3 that were weather-related, we grew 12% internationally. So it really gives us confidence. The opportunity we see internationally, the 36% growth in new/competitive Catalyst placements as a result of the adoption of EVI, this really gives us confidence to continue to build on what are really some world-class country teams around the world. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just one follow-up just because I've gotten hit by a couple of clients as I'm sitting here talking. It's just like this. I guess people feel like that the 2019 guide is a little bit conservative at this point in time. Obviously, you've got the stock-based compensation headwinds that are factored in. I guess what are some of the puts and takes on the guide for next year? And just walk through it, the estimates are below the consensus estimate. And so I'm just \u2013 I think people are looking for a little bit more color. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: So I think, Derik, the key place to start is our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook, the 11.5% to 12.5%. That's basically right on our 2018 trend. So if you take the current guide that we have that our full-year number is going to be about in line with our year-to-date growth rate of \u2013 it's 13.2% and adjust for the benefit growth rate \u2013 benefit we're getting from the revenue accounting standard change, which is a little bit above 1%, it's effectively approximately 12%. That's the midpoint for next year. So I think our guide on CAG Dx recurring revenues is right in line with trend. We did point out that I think our overall organic growth will be up against some tougher compares on just higher levels of instrument placements. We're looking to grow instruments and get benefit from the investments we're making. But we've had an exceptional year and we're going to have a tougher compare there. And I think LPD, we're appropriately cautious just given some of the end market dynamics. It's a business that's 90% international and more heavily weighted to emerging markets. And I think we're being appropriate in having a more cautious view on growth in that area. But I think the underlying core driver of our economics in our business, the CAG recurring is very much in line with trend and that's supportive of the strong operational \u2013 financial and operational outlook that we're sharing. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And then with regard to the \u2013 in addition to those comments from Brian, with regard to the earnings, I do want to reinforce the point that Brian made in his prepared remarks that we're going to see a step-down in the tax rate benefit \u2013 predict a step-down in tax rate benefit from stock option compensation of 10% to 13%. And that may not have been \u2013 since we've talked about the benefits in 2018 all along, I've been very, very transparent about that. In 2019, we're going to have fewer options exercised. We have fewer options expiry, we had some pull forward into this year. So that's really a non \u2013 that's an accounting change. But when we look at comparable constant currency earnings growth, we get to the 15% to 18%, which is factored in our long-term guide. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jonathan Block with Stifel. Your line is open. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, thanks, guys, and good morning. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Good morning. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Brian, I've been jumping between calls, I apologize if you've addressed this. But just want to address \u2013 or I think how we should view margin expansion in 2019? And I guess, where I'm going with this is, is it more shared between gross margin and OpEx leverage relative to what we've seen in 2018? And then a sort of a follow-up to that, I'm guessing when we think about the quarterly cadence, is the OpEx leverage maybe a little bit bigger in 2H relative to 1H as you lap some of the more recent investments? Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, I think that's a good way to look at it, Jon. I think we're expecting to have gross margin improvement driven by the things that we've been focused on, which is sustaining solid price gains and improving productivity in our operations, including global labs and those in growing areas like our consumable revenues, which have benefits for us and we expect to build on that. I think that the OpEx leverage, we do have another wave of investment here around the U.S. expansion as well as the international expansions that we've highlighted that we think are very high-return investments. These have been very successful for us as we've accelerated our growth in recent years and just reinforces the opportunity that we see to continue to invest in growing the market. And I think to your point that will create relatively more of a challenge earlier in the year in terms of compares than in later in the year. We'll share more color on that, obviously, as we finalize our plans and provide the full-year numbers for you on the Q4 call, but I think that's an appropriate way to look at it. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. And then just... Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And then just \u2013 we're always appreciative of your questions, Jon, and recognize the situation you're in. We are very committed to our long-term goals of 50 to 100 basis point operating margin expansion, which we're over-delivering \u2013 expect to over-deliver on in 2018 and expect to continue to deliver on in 2019 and over the long term. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thanks, Jon. And maybe one or two more if I may. Jon, anything on the competitive update? I mean, are you seeing any changes in the field with the recent acquisition of Abaxis and the deal actually closing, positive or negative for you guys? And any alteration as to pricing the market or changes in the way Zoetis is coming to market overseas? And then, I've got one quick follow-up to that. Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I'll tell you we have \u2013 the answer is really no. The one comment you may have missed in the prepared comments is that we published peer-reviewed research, which shows a substantial superiority in our SNAP 4Dx, obviously, an important franchise in detecting tick-borne disease and heartworm. And as I commented, accuracy is the number one criterion for customers in purchasing decisions, after all, that's the whole point of running the test, it's to detect disease. And we're doing a great job with our close to 500 field-based professionals getting the word out on the differential. And we had a very strong rapid assay quarter in Q3, mostly U.S. business, over 80% in the face of a competitive product launch against the important 4Dx franchise. The year-over-year growth of 26% globally in new and competitive Catalyst placements walk and ride along. And so really we haven't skipped a beat here in Q3 from a competitive point of view. Our customer retention rates remain very strong and consistent, maybe even slightly improved in the U.S. and very, very high \u2013 even higher internationally. Our price realization continues in 2% to 3% range in the U.S. and good \u2013 similar type of price realization internationally. We believe that our opportunity here is to create our own growth. And when we can get over 2,000 practices see 16% same-store sales growth in their diagnostics when they start adopting preventative care, I know you did some studies on, that's really less than 10% of our total customers who work with us on preventative care. We get 16% overall diagnostic recurring revenue growth in these customers year-over-year in the last year when they adopted these programs. This is the opportunity that we have. And, of course, we're unique in being able to do that because our diagnostic line finds more underlying disease and finds it earlier. And so with all the additions of the SDMA, our differentiated hematology, fecal antigen, the quality 4Dx, it actually increases the medical justification and evidence-based medicine to run preventative care, blood work on pets of all ages. And that story is resonating and has a very, very long-term runway and is a unique opportunity for IDEXX to do. So, really no changes in the competitive environment to answer your question. Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. I'll actually take my last one offline. Thanks for your time, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Erin Wright - Credit Suisse : Great, thanks. You discussed the international lab business some, but I'm just curious what you're seeing in terms of the competitive landscape, growth was pretty strong in the U.S. in particular. Any major changes there or what are you kind of hearing in the field? Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you. No real changes in the U.S., a very strong performance continuing to edge every quarter a little bit higher, customer retention in the U.S. I think this is the continued adoption of unique value \u2013 the innovations that I had experienced, so the reference lab services, SDMA, molecular diagnostics, fecal antigen, VetConnect PLUS and, of course, 500 diagnostic subject matter experts that are calling on practices across the U.S. every day. And so customers value our professionals coming in and helping them on how to advance their standards. And so it's a very strong \u2013 the U.S. reference lab business is a very, very strong component of our overall diagnostic offering in the U.S. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, U.S. generates almost $7 out of every $10 of global reference lab business, so an important element of the equation. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, just to reinforce, it was some of the metrics we shared, Erin, we had 15% growth in Catalyst placements at new or competitive accounts. We had accelerated growth in consumable revenues, continued mid-teen growth in reference labs, solid continued volume growth in rapid assay, net price gains in the 2% to 3% range, the 13.5% overall. The U.S. is really continuing to execute well, record levels of retention, record levels of customers under contract that steadily increases. So, I think we're feeling great about the U.S. business and... Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah, I don't want to say it's not competitive environment, it's always been a competitive environment. I just don't see any change in that competitive \u2013 we're competing with innovation and growth. And that's resonating with our customers. In addition, we have more and more of our customers who have elected to partner with IDEXX with our IDEXX 360 program, which is a very friendly way to add capital and combine with a multiyear commitment to IDEXX and so... Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And so we had 30% growth in SediVue year-over-year in North America. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. So, SediVue \u2013 many times when we placed SediVue with an IDEXX 360, we get the entire diagnostic revenue of that customer under a five, six-year agreement. Erin Wright - Credit Suisse : Okay. Great, thanks. And then one last one, just drilling into rapid assay in particular here, any changes or surprises relative to your thinking on the competitive positioning on 4Dx Plus? And how is the success in bundling in SNAP Pro? Are you seeing that improve overall kind of retention rates for what may be an inherently more vulnerable segment? Thanks. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much for that question. We publish peer-reviewed research on the superior accuracy of 4Dx and, of course, that's very important to customers. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks. But I do want to add a little bit more color on SNAP Pro. We had a very strong quarter for SNAP Pro placements, up 10% year-over-year in the U.S. And customers who've adopted SNAP Pro into their workflow are more loyal and grow their rapid assay test utilization faster than those that haven't. That's why we had a very solid, I think, rapid assay quarter in Q3. As of Q3, Erin, customers who are active and connected with SNAP Pro, meaning they're integrated with IDEXX and SmartService and everything and they're using SNAP Pro, they constitute 57% of our SNAP 4Dx revenues in the U.S. This is a growing percentage over time as we continue to place instruments. And thus, we're well on our way to turning the SNAP 4Dx Plus market into an instrument-based razor-razorblade business model. And, Erin, I think you know because SNAP Pro leverages IDEXX's unique integration of the instrument through IDEXX VetLab Station with the overall software of the practice, the practice information management system, you get big staff productivity and economic benefits from charge capture from this integration. Still totally unique to IDEXX after 10 years, and SNAP Pro builds upon our overall VetLab integration ecosystem, increasing the loyalty for not just rapid assay, but the overall diagnostic offerings. That strategy just continues to march along. And we're \u2013 I think that's \u2013 there're a lot of reasons why we had a solid rapid assay quarter in Q3 in the face of competitive launch accuracy and also the evolution of the customer base with SNAP Pro. Erin Wright - Credit Suisse : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of David Westenberg with C.L. King. Your line is open. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Thank you for taking my question. So, the other one kind of on the European reference lab dynamic, you mentioned that you're talking to customers about getting them onto a little bit more of an EVI focus and that would imply that you will have revenue kind of catch up as these customers migrate to, say, maybe more instrument. So, just for the sake of our models, can you kind of just talk about how this might play out over the next few quarters and just to reconcile what reference lab is going to do versus what instruments they're going do in Europe? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: So, I think we feel very good with the instrument placement momentum in Europe. Certainly, Q3 was a strong quarter with a 36% year-over-year growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements outside the U.S., which of course was the EVI focus. And what we're going to be doing going into 2019 is starting to roll out the IDEXX 360 program internationally which really wraps in growing the reference lab business as well as the in-house business in a multiyear partnership along with instrument placements. We think this will help us continue with strong instrument placements and, of course, consumable growth and also help us build reference lab growth. So... Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And, Dave, I think it's important to understand, EVI as a metric is very helpful for our sales teams in thinking about when they're placing or trying to place instruments, what type of placements drive the most value. It's not intended to be something that shifts attention from growing the customer relationship and that is reflected in how we approach compensation where we have \u2013 the majority of our compensation is oriented towards overall recurring growth. I think what \u2013 so I don't think the EVI metric should drive an issue in terms of reference lab growth. I think what we're acknowledging is that we've got a huge opportunity for instrument placements internationally in Catalyst and that's been our focus. And we've had somewhat of a shift from the sales execution towards that and that is something that we are anticipating we can \u2013 we move back in balance over time. And so don't see the near-term kind of dynamics as being something to be concerned about for the long term. But I think, just to be clear, EVI is I think not something that should negatively impact our growth in reference labs. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Even in the near term. Okay, thank you very much. And then maybe just to go a little bit further on the European area, would there be any different kind of customer dynamics with the fact that there is fairly deconsolidation in Northern Europe? And maybe offer what some of the challenges are there and maybe what some of the opportunities there are. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: So with the corporatization or consolidation that's taking place in Northern Europe, we are in excellent shape with most of the consolidators except for one who happens to have a competitive reference lab. And so we think we're in very good shape, and many of these are very interested in our opportunity to help them grow same-store sales. Because what's happening is while, on one hand, they can grow through acquisitions, they'd also like to grow four-wall revenue, which has very nice drop-through, particularly with diagnostics. And they're appreciative of the fact that we can bring resources to bear at the current level through our commercial organizations and, of course, unique innovation to help drive growth. We also have a fabulous software offering. We have the leading cloud-based software in Europe, Animana. But the Smart Flow acquisition, which we're really excited about, we closed in early Q3, is a global platform. And we have a strong base of customers in Europe, U.S. and Australia. It's actually \u2013 and it adds value to really all customers with different practice information management systems because it's workflow software. And then when we integrate it with the PIMS, which we're already well on our way of doing with Neo, Cornerstone, and Animana, it brings even more unique value to these customers. And so this is something I think will help us both in Europe and the U.S. with these corporate customers that are looking for a partner who can bring a sophisticated enterprise software approach. And there really isn't anyone else with the competencies and product ecosystem, software ecosystem, including cloud-based software ecosystem that can partner with our customers. And so I think this will benefit us on both the software side as well as the diagnostics side. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: And I realize we're low on time, so you can just answer this yes or no. Does the 2019 guidance factor any sort of maybe late product launch? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: It factors all of our plans in place. And so generally speaking, if you look at IDEXX growth in any particular year, most product launches have not really been a major component. It's really the core growth, the adoption of products we've launched over the last five to seven years. And so we're not making any product launch announcements at this point in time, but it factors in all of our plans for 2019. David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And we will go to the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Hey guys. Thanks. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yes, we're still here. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: You had some hot weather in Europe in Q3. As we think about Q4 and into the first half of 2019, can you just speak to reference lab growth? Brian, I think you might have made comments about potentially mid to high single-digit growth in the near term from international reference labs. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: That's right. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Historically, you've been in the 13% to 14% growth rate in reference labs. So I guess excluding weather, is there any reason to think that that level of growth might decelerate? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: You're talking about \u2013 that would be global growth that you were referring to, the 13% to 14%? Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Correct. Correct. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Yeah. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I think there is nothing to say that we can't get back to those levels. We're certainly growing better than that in the U.S. and have been, and I think we've got great... Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And U.S. is $7 out of every $10 of global reference lab volume, so an important contributor to the whole. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: So to your question, this is more of a near-term impact. We haven't gotten that granular heading into 2019, Mark, but I think there is an aspect of this that we've shifted some executional focus. So this will kind of... Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: It's interesting. The weather thing, there are really two facts going on. One is obviously lower foot traffic, but the other thing is customers get concerned about sending samples to the lab when it's really hot out. They're worried they're going to get spoiled along the way. And so those are the two factors which can \u2013 and it was very clear that the six weeks or so in summer during that heat wave, that impacted our revenue. It wasn't the only slowdown, but it was... Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: And, Mark, I'd just reinforce, our 2019 guidance basically for overall CAG recurring growth is right in line with our year-to-date trends, adjusted for foreign exchange. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Right. Adjusted for the 1%, 11.5% to 12.5%. So we're really seeing the fundamentals of the business continue in 2019 that we see year-to-date and through the balance of 2018 for total CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues which, as you know, is 75% of the total IDEXX revenues. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Terrific. And then, practice revenue of 5% was strong in the quarter. Historically, you've been somewhere in the 4% to 7% range. In terms of end user demand, do you see any changes there? Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: It's remained very solid, as you pointed out, in a similar range of growth. And of course, that's the overall growth in the vet clinics and we believe... Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Our customers are growing faster. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Our customers grow faster, diagnostics grow faster, and we influence that growth. So I think we feel good about the market trends, particularly in the U.S. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Great, and just one last quick one, I think you indicated at your Analyst Day that you intend to launch a new slide onto Catalyst sometime in 2019. Is that still your intention? And can you provide any color around what that might look like? Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I think just to review the history in 2018, we launched the Catalyst SDMA slide, and that has had great success. It's adopted by almost 50% of our global Catalyst base. We launched the SDMA T4 combo kit in the June-July timeframe. We launched the CRP slide, which has been a great success outside the U.S. The U.S. doesn't fully appreciate the value of CRP. They will in time. And we will continue to expand the menu. And we also expanded the menu on ProCyte with retic hemoglobin, another parameter. So, this is really a steady diet of menu expansion. We're not talking about any specific further expansions at this time. But they're in the pipeline, of course. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Expect ongoing innovation. Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.: Okay. Thanks guys. Brian P. McKeon - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And, Mr. Ayers, I'd like to turn it back over to you for any closing comments. Jonathan W. Ayers - IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.: I just want to thank everybody and appreciate your attention during a very busy day. And also, I want to thank all the employees. We just continue to have a great performance in terms of bringing advanced care to veterinarians, pet owners and pets alike, it's what drives us, it's what our purpose is. And we look forward to finishing the year and again we are really proud to be able to provide 2019 guidance, which is something that not too many companies do. And we're even more proud that we've done this for the last 15 years. And then, we've \u2013 in terms of the earnings guidance and we've delivered against that earnings guidance within or above the range on an adjusted constant currency basis in the subsequent year that we provided guidance for. So, it really is a testament to the team and the predictability and enduring growth characteristics of this business, driven by a very high degree of recurring revenue. So, with that, we'll close the call. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference Service. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the IDEXX Laboratories Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. Participating in the call this morning are Jon Ayers, Chief Executive Officer; Brian McKeon, Chief Financial Officer; and John Ravis, Senior Director, Investor Relations.  IDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements. Listeners are reminded that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the forward-looking statements notice in our press release issued this morning as well as in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission which can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website, idexx.com.  During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in our earnings release which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. In reviewing our fourth quarter 2018 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth, constant-currency growth and comparable constant-currency growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2017 unless otherwise noted.  To allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit his or her questions to one with one follow-up as necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we\u2019ll take your additional questions.  I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results and provide an update on our financial outlook for 2019. IDEXX achieved continued strong financial performance in Q4. This concluded another year where we again delivered revenue and EPS gains above our long-term financial goals. In terms of highlights we achieved 10% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter on track with our expectations, driven by consistent 13% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. We achieved full year organic revenue growth of 11.6%, aligned with our long-term financial goals of 10% plus annual gains supported by 13% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues in both U.S. and international markets. Our full year EPS was $4.26, an increase of 36% on a comparable constant currency basis. This performance reflected strong top-line growth, a 130-basis point improvement in operating margins on a constant-currency basis and benefits from U.S. Tax Reform. We\u2019re well-positioned to build on these results in 2019. We\u2019re maintaining our outlook for 9.5% to 11% organic revenue growth reflected in our consistent guidance range of $2,385 million, to $2,425 million in annual revenues. We\u2019re raising our EPS guidance to $4.66 to $4.78 or growth of 15% to 18% off our 2018 results on a comparable constant currency basis, aligned with our long-term goals. This is an increase of $0.04 per share at midpoint reflecting flow-through of $0.06 per share of 2018 profit upsides, supported by operating margin gains at the high-end of our goals and upsized from approximately 50 basis points of favorability in our effective tax rate, which we expect will sustain in 2019. These gains are partially offset by a $0.02 per share reduction in our estimate for share-based compensation tax benefits related to changes in our stock price, which is excluded in our comparable constant currency EPS growth calculation. Our guidance reflects consistent expectations for year-on-year foreign exchange impacts. We\u2019ll walk you through the details of our 2019 guidance later in my comments. Let\u2019s begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results by segment and region. Q4 results were driven by ongoing momentum in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were $479 million up 12% organically reflecting continued strong gains in recurring CAG diagnostic revenues. Global CAG diagnostic recurring revenues increased 13% organically, including $4.5 million or 1.3% in growth benefit from the new revenue Accounting Standard primarily related to our modified retrospective restatement. By region, U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 13.3% organically, driven by mid-teen growth in consumables and reference lab sales and continued solid growth in rapid as a revenues. U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was primarily volume driven, with overall net price gains of approximately 2%. U.S. recurring CAG Diagnostics customer retention metrics sustained at high-levels, reinforcing the durability of a recurring revenue base. IDEXX\u2019s U.S. recurring CAG growth performance continues to outpace U.S. veterinary practice market growth reflected in our dataset from approximately 5,000 clinics. In Q4 patient visits were up 0.3% and clinic revenues increased 4% per practice compared to the prior-year period, a relatively lower level of overall practice revenue growth compared to recent trends. This same-store growth data is for veterinary visits of all types and appears to be impacted by moderated growth in non-clinical visits, as we\u2019ve seen growth for clinical visits trending closer to 2%. These solid clinical visit trends are aligned with our continued strong business results. We\u2019re refining our data tracking and analysis of clinical versus non-clinical visit trends and look forward to sharing more of this front on future conference calls. International CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 12.5% organically in Q4 driven by 20%-plus organic growth in international consumable revenues. Mid-single-digit reference lab growth improved relative to our third quarter results, with overall gains constrained by continued softer performance in select markets impacted in part by a commercial focus in 2018 on driving very strong in-clinic revenue gains. Veterinary Software Services and Diagnostic Imaging Systems revenues increased 9% globally in Q4, reflecting 8% organic gains and benefits from our recent acquisition of Smart Flow. These results were supported by solid growth in recurring software services associated with our practice management platforms and continued to strength in our Diagnostic Imaging business, which posted a 20% increase in digital imaging system unit placements for the full year 2018. For the full year, overall CAG revenues increased 13% organically driven by 13% gains in CAG Diagnostic revenues, strong premium instrument placements and solid growth in our Veterinary Software and Digital Imaging business. Full year CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth included 1.3% in nonrecurring growth rate benefit from the new revenue Accounting Standard changes. Adjusting for this effect our 2019 goals target continued low-teen organic growth in our CAG business, building on our strong business momentum. Our Order business revenues grew 8% organically in the fourth quarter to $30 million, driven by strong gains in international markets, which were offset to a degree by the timing of year-end U.S. shipments, which moderated overall Q4 growth. For the full year, Water revenues reached $125 million, up 9% organically with faster operating profit growth, reflecting 45% operating margins. We\u2019re very pleased with our continued momentum in the Water business and our targeting continued to high-single-digit organic growth in this highly profitable business in 2019. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue in Q4 was $34 million, down 5% organically as expected, reflecting comparisons to high-2017 year-end government program and distributor ordering. Quarterly growth was also pressured by end-market impacts related to African swine fever outbreaks in China, which is our largest market for swine diagnostic testing, and the continued impact of low milk prices in key markets, which has constrained demand for Dairy testing and growth in bovine pregnancy test sales. For the full year 2018 our LPD revenue was $131 million, up 1% organically. As our LPD revenues are 90% international, macroeconomic pressures in-markets like China can have a relatively larger impact on the LPD business segment than the company as a whole. Given these factors, our 2019 outlook factors in expectations for relatively flat organic growth in our LPD business. For the full year 2018, total U.S. revenues reached $1.358 billion, up 13% organically, and international revenues increased 10% organically to $855 million or approximately 39% of IDEXX\u2019s total revenues. Full year revenue gains were driven by 13% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues in both U.S. and international markets, solidly within our long-term target growth ranges. Our strong Q4 and full year results reflect continued benefits from global expansion of our premium instrument base. Globally we placed 3,957 premium analyzers in Q4 an increase of 8% compared to high-2017 Q4 levels bringing full year 2018 premium placements to 13,047, up 14%. We placed 2,042 Catalyst in total in Q4 globally, a 10% year-over-year increase, 1,170 premium hematology instruments up 13% and 745 SediVues in line with very strong prior-year levels. Our focus on high economic value placements drove a 15% global increase in global Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in Q4, and solid EBI gains in both North America and international. In North America, we placed 421 Catalyst placements at newer competitive accounts or 76% of total North America Catalyst placements. International Catalyst placements at newer competitive accounts increased 29% year-on-year in Q4, to 710 instruments, contributing 48% of total international Catalyst placements. For the full year, our new and competitive Catalyst placements totaled 3,626 globally, an impressive 20% year-over-year increase. In addition to strong premium instrument results, we placed 2,345 SNAP Pros in Q4 supported by over 2,000 placements in North America, bringing our worldwide installed base to over 25,000. CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues in Q4 were 37 million a 3% increase organically, off a strong compare in 2017, with gains moderated in the quarter by instrument program mix impacts. Q4 instrument revenues include a $10.5 million in revenues attributed to the Accounting Standard primarily related to expansion of the IDEXX 360 customer program. Our strong Q4 instrument placement results capped a year of substantial progress in expanding our premium instrument base. We finished the year with 37,000 Catalysts up 24%, nearly 29,000 premium hematology analyzers up 11% and nearly 6,600 SediVues up 69%, reflecting a record 2,719 SediVue placements in 2018. Combined our premium instrument base increased 21% globally in 2018. Our expanding instrument base and benefits from new test innovation and our strength in commercial capability continues to drive strong recurring CAG Diagnostic revenue gains. Instrument consumable revenues of 157 million grew 19% organically in Q4. Results reflect continued 20%-plus gains in international markets and sustained mid-teen growth in the U.S. High-volume-driven consumable gains were supported by expansion of SediVue paper run and SDMA slide revenues, which again contributed about 4% combined to year-on-year consumable revenue gains in the quarter. Reference Laboratory and Consulting Services with revenues of $178 million grew 11% organically in fourth quarter. U.S. lab momentum remains strong reflecting a mid-teen volume-driven organic revenue gains. Global lab revenue growth was moderated by mid-single-digit gains in international markets, which while up from Q3, were impacted by continued soft growth trends in select markets. We\u2019re forecasting continued moderate lab growth in our international reference Lab business in the near-term, as we enhance our commercial focus to build on the very strong progress we\u2019ve driven in developing our IDEXX VetLab business in international markets. Rapid Assay revenues of 48 million grew 5% organically in Q4 reflecting solid gains across U.S. and international markets. Rapid Assay gains were primarily volume-driven supported by continued growth of 40x plus, Specialty and first generation products. Turning to the P&L. Gross profit was $300 million in Q4 up 10% on a reported basis. Adjusting for foreign exchange impacts gross margins increased about 70 basis points supported by continued solid net price gains and strong growth in Consumable revenues. Foreign exchange hedge gains which benefit gross profits were $1 million in Q4. Operating profit in Q4 was $115 million up 18% as-reported, or 20% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit results benefited from strong revenue gains and operating expense leverage supporting a 170 basis point improvement in constant currency operating margins in the quarter. Operating expenses in Q4 were up 6% as-reported or 7% on a constant currency basis driven by growth investments in Sales and Market and supporting G&A resources in our CAG business with overall OpEx growth mitigated by disciplined cost control and LPD. For the full year, operating profit was $491 million. This reflects an operating margin of 22.2% for the full year, an increase of 130 basis points on a constant-currency basis. This outstanding result reflects approximately 30 basis points of constant-currency gross margin gains or about 50 basis points of improvement adjusted for impacts related to cost reclassifications in our lab business. Our strong full year operating margin results also reflect significant operating expense leverage benefiting from our accelerated revenue growth while we expanded our sales and marketing capability globally and increased investment in products and software R&D, which reached $118 million in 2018 or nearly $130 million on a cash basis. EPS in Q4 was $0.98 per share, including $0.01 per share in tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity and $0.02 in negative impacts related to year-over-year FX changes. On a comparable constant-currency basis, EPS increased 40% including net benefits from U.S. Tax Reform. For 2018, EPS was $4.26, including $21 million or $0.24 per share in tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity. For the full year, foreign exchange rate changes increased EPS by $0.01 per share net of FX hedge loss impacts of $1 million. Adjusting for these factors and prior year discrete tax impacts, 2018 EPS growth was 36% on a comparable constant-currency basis. Our effective tax rate for 2018 was 17.6%, including approximately 5% of rate benefit related to share-based compensation activity. This tax rate was approximately $0.03 per share favorable to our earlier guidance estimates, including about $0.02 of additional benefit related to share-based compensation activity. Free cash flow was $284 million for 2018 or about 75% of net income. Our free cash flow was net of $116 million of capital investment, including $42 million of combined investment related to our Westbrook, Maine headquarters expansion and German core lab relocation. We also supported $60 million in instrument program investments for the year, an increase of $44 million year-on-year, associated with the very successful IDEXX 360 program in the U.S. in support of strong premium instrument placement growth internationally. We allocated $369 million in capital towards share repurchases for the full year 2018, including repurchases of 489,000 shares in Q4 for $103 million. Our balance sheet is in an excellent position. We ended the year with $1.006 billion in debt, $124 million in cash and $450 million in capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 1.67 times gross and 1.46 times net of cash. Our strong performance and disciplined capital allocation supported achievement of a 49% after-tax return on invested capital excluding cash and investments for 2018. We\u2019re well-positioned to build on this strong performance in 2019 with the financial outlook aligned with our long-term goals. We\u2019re maintaining consistent 2019 guidance for 9.5% to 11% organic revenue growth and revenue of $2.385 billion to $2.425 billion. This outlook equates to reported revenue growth of 8% to 9.5% net of a consistent projected 1.5% FX growth headwind at the rates assumed in our press release. We finalized the components of our revenue guidance as part of our year-end planning and refined our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue organic growth outlook to 11% to 12%, building on our exceptional 13.2% organic growth in 2018, which included 1.3% of nonrecurring growth rate benefit related to the implementation of the new revenue standard. We\u2019re raising our 2019 EPS outlook to $4.66 to $4.78, an increase of $0.04 per share at the midpoint, reflecting approximately $0.06 per share in flow-through of 2018 profit upsides offset by a $0.02 per share reduction in estimated tax benefits from share-based compensation activity. This outlook factors in an estimated $0.03 negative year-on-year impact from FX net of $10 million in projected hedge gains, consistent with our preliminary guidance estimates. As a sensitivity, a 1% change in the dollar from rates assumed in our press release would impact 2019 revenues by approximately $8 million and operating profit by approximately $2 million, net of hedge positions currently in place. We\u2019ve refined elements of our P&L outlook as we finalized our 2019 plans while maintaining a consistent comparable EPS growth outlook of 15% to 18%. We\u2019re now targeting 50 to 80 basis points of constant currency operating margin improvement, a slight reduction to the high end of our targeted improvement range, with targeted year-on-year gains driven primarily by gross margin improvement. This refinement is offset by favorable updates to our projections for interest expense and year-on-year share count reduction. We\u2019re now projecting $37 million to $38 million in net interest costs in 2019 and a 1% to 1.5% reduction in average shares outstanding, with both metrics aligned with an assumed maintenance of our net leverage levels at approximately 1.5 times EBITDA. Our outlook for effective tax rate in 2019 remains at 20% to 21%, as sustained 2018 upsides are offset by updated estimates for tax rate benefits of stock-based compensation, reflecting more recent shape price levels. We now project $6.5 million to $8.5 million or approximately 2% in tax benefit from exercise of stock-based compensation in 2019, approximately $0.02 per share below prior estimates and $0.15 per share below high-2018 levels. In terms of free cash flow, we expect to continue to invest in high-return instrument growth programs globally and to deploy $160 million to $175 million in capital spending, including approximately $70 million related to completion of our Westbrook headquarter and German core lab projects. For 2019, this results in an outlook for free cash flow of 60% to 65% of net income or approximately 80% of net income normalized for these two major projects. In terms of our first quarter outlook in 2019, we expect Q1 reported revenue growth in the 6% to 7.5% range, reflecting organic gains of 9% to 10.5%, net of a projected 1% equivalent days\u2019 headwind. Q1 operating margins are expected to be at the lower-end of our full year improvement goals of 50 to 80 basis points as we continue to advance implementation of our international commercial resource expansion. We expect our effective tax rate in Q1 to be 18.5% to 19%, including projected benefits from share-based compensation exercise activity. That concludes the financial overview. Let me turn the call over to Jon for his comments. Jonathan Ayers : Okay. Brian, thank you. A little color commentary and then we\u2019ll open it up to questions. We finished 2018 with strong revenue growth and impressive bottom-line results, even as we\u2019re making significant incremental investments in the business to support our customers, and that will generate sustained growth for years to come. Companion Animal diagnostic recurring revenue, which constitutes 75% of IDEXX\u2019s overall revenues in 2018 grew organically 13% for the quarter and the full year, consistent with our expectations. U.S. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue, which represents almost two-thirds of the total global generated organic growth of 13.3%, while international generated 12.5%. International growth was supported by 20%-plus instrument consumable organic revenue growth. Clearly, pet owners have an increasing appreciation of the importance of health care for their pets. Our growth trends as 2018 wraps up are also a testament to the value our customers see in IDEXX\u2019s unique diagnostic offering and the importance the IDEXX technologies play in health care. The market for veterinary and \u2013 medical and technician talent is really competitive right now, as you can see from this morning\u2019s job report. In fact, it\u2019s been reported that there\u2019s one veterinarian available for every five veterinary job openings. And so practice owners need to attract and retain valued staff by providing an essential tools and a partner to support their job well and take the best care of patients; thus the importance of IDEXX\u2019s far more advanced innovations. And so our customer retention metrics, which are the foundation of growth in a recurring revenue model continue at exceptionally high-levels in Q4, if not inching up ever so slightly. Our organic growth remains primarily volume driven, augmented by continued modest price realization. The latter reflecting benefits of how our offerings advance with the benefit of almost $130 million of cash R&D and diagnostics and software in 2018 and a projected almost $150 million in cash R&D in the same in 2019. This technology for life approach includes the behind-the-scenes software upgrades that happen regularly for our point-of-care instruments like the recently-announced Neural Network 4.0 for SediVue advancing menu. And the progesterone test for our Catalyst platform, our seventh new test in seven years on the Catalyst platform, as well as regular advances in VetConnest PLUS our cloud-based diagnostic software. For 2018 placements of Catalyst in new and competitive accounts were up 20%. New and competitive Catalyst placements over the course of the year were an important contributor to the 19% organic growth and IDEXX VetLab instrument consumables in Q4. We\u2019re praised with the instrument placement results that Q4 contributed to the year that Brian has enumerated as well as the completion of the rollout of Catalyst one analyzers at over 1,000 Banfield hospitals. We\u2019re entering 2019 having completed important commercial expansions around the world. The U.S. expansion with the greater customer coverage from a deeper field base, professional organization was in place for the start of Q4. There\u2019s always some settling in during the first quarter of an expansion, as our professionals, including newly-recruited professionals, develop relationships with their customers in their new or reconfigured territories. Especially in this light, the North American growth metrics also against the strong compare were very strong. As we enter 2019, we\u2019re beyond this initial settling in-period in our U.S. market, our largest, with an experienced world-class team of professionals and frontline leadership. This team is focused on growing diagnostic in the Software category, advancing customers adoptions of new protocols such as preventive care diagnostics, fecal antigen testing, urine analysis using SediVue and growing the overall number of customers that benefit from IDEXX\u2019s unique technologies. Our U.S. field footprint is in place \u2013 with our U.S. field footprint in place a quarter ago, our 2019 U.S. focus is on the productivity that comes from rep development and time and territory. Our commercial investments in the U.S. in 2019 will focus on high ROI opportunities beyond the field footprint. Our international teams\u2019 expansion plans were timed generally about a quarter later than the U.S. At this point, we\u2019re largely complete in hiring expanded commercial resources to advance instrument placements and a Companion Animal Group diagnostic recurring revenue growth in accordance with our plans. Our international teams are building competencies with our key commercial strategies. For example, the economic value index of an instrument placement to prioritize high-value chemistry placements which is one of the reasons why we saw a 29% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements in Q4 internationally to a record over 700 units which was up 100 units from Q3 of 2018, which itself was a quarterly record. Another strategic competency being adopted by international is leveraging the IDEXX 360 program to accelerate instrument placements and drive recurring revenue growth. This type of program is generally new to our IDEXX teams outside of North America and I\u2019m pleased with the team\u2019s progress here as the year wrapped up. Our international teams are poised to have a great 2019, spreading the benefits of IDEXX\u2019s innovation such as IDEXX SDMA, including on Catalyst. Catalyst placements and our best-in-class hematologist offerings as the expansions is complete, they are settling period in the first quarter 2019. These international Commercial expansions along with a unique diagnostic and software technology offering gives us confidence in our revenue growth targets primarily driven by volume testing gains with secondary support from modest price realization and net new customer additions. While current economic times bring us steady than a broader macro noise, IDEXX\u2019s growth remains solid reflecting the durable recurring nature of our revenues, the benefit of our differentiation enabled by our industry-leading investments in the innovation and supported by the growing bond between pets and their owners. In sum, we are sustaining solid growth momentum as we enter 2019 which gives us confidence for the 11% to 12% projected organic growth of CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues in 2019 similar to the 2018 growth trends on an adjusted basis. Before I open the call to questions, I want to express my deep gratitude to our employees for their accomplishments in 2018 and the pursuit of our purpose to enhance the health and well-being of pets, people and Livestock and also my gratitude to the continued confidence the customers have in IDEXX as a value-added technology partner.  So with those comments, Cynthia, we\u2019ll open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan Daniels : Yeah, good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Two somewhat disparate ones. First off, Jon for you, as we think about the expanded international sales force and your potential rollout of IDEXX 360 and kind of integrating the reference and point-of-care more actively, is there an opportunity to push the preventive care protocols and challenge in those markets as well? Or is it still a bit too early in those markets to think that could be a organic growth driver? Jonathan Ayers : Yeah, thank you for that. We\u2019re actually beginning to look at that in some of the more advanced international markets. I think it\u2019s an opportunity we have. And in addition, when we talk about the benefits of diagnostics in a preventive care scenario, it reinforces the importance of running diagnostics when it is not a wellness presentation. And so I think we\u2019ll see it early days in international in 2019, very early days, kind of where we were at the U.S. several years ago. But preventive care really has come of age in 2018 and it\u2019s a big component of our growth in 2019 in the U.S. and now more and more the Canadian market. Ryan Daniels : Okay. And then if we look at the U.S. market, I thought it was somewhat noteworthy in the press release you called out Millennials and that being a focus for the organization. Can you speak to that note in a little bit more detail as it relates to, you know, how like it serves as a tailwind for the industry and then anything you\u2019ll do specifically given the large size of that Millennial market and their proclivity to spend more on vet care? Thanks. Jonathan Ayers : Yeah, so Millennials, which we generally define as the 15-year span from 37 to 22, are now in their, you know, taking care of their own pets. They\u2019re also an important and growing part of the professional community of veterinarians and technicians, and all the evidence that we see is that the Millennials visit the vet more. They\u2019re more in tune with their pets. And I think that one metric kind of calls it out that while maybe 20% of prior generations feel their pets have special health needs, 46% of Millennials think their pets have special health needs, which really I think is an indication of how Millennials are in touch with their pets. And so we see this as \u2013 and then the early evidence is even the generation beyond that, maybe taking it even a bit further, but this is obviously the largest component of the consumer category right now and I think will be a key long-term driver for the growing importance of pet health care. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. Looking at the patient visit growth metrics that you gave, you gave some new color on the clinical visits which were up 2%. How has that metric trended over the past few years, and how would you characterize kind of underlying demand trends across the U.S. companion animal market? I assume that is a U.S. metric you\u2019re giving there. And what does your guidance assume in terms of underlying demand trends for the year? Can you speak to some of the more resilient aspects to your business that can withstand the sort of fluctuations in underlying demand trends? Thanks. Jonathan Ayers : Yeah, I want to start with the last part. What we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re growing the utilization and importance of diagnostic in all kinds of presentations. I think people are realizing that just by doing a physical exam and a history, you\u2019re missing a lot of pieces to the equation without running diagnostics, and of course you\u2019re missing other pieces of the equation if you\u2019re not running IDEXX diagnostics. So even though we\u2019ve seen some slight \u2013 some moderation in the pet visits over the course of the second half of 2018 in the U.S. market, which is really the only market that we have industry data, and as you note, I think the clinical visits are moderating less. But still, we\u2019ve got 2% growth in clinical visits, so. Which is of course the only type of visit that is important to IDEXX. The nonclinical visit is not really a factor for IDEXX. We\u2019re seeing good demand growth. And so our expectation in 2019 is consistent with really what we saw in 2018. Brian McKeon : Second half of 2018. Jonathan Ayers : I think we\u2019re factoring in the recent trends, and our outlook is very much in line with the adjusted growth that we\u2019re driving coming out of the back half. Brian McKeon : Let\u2019s also recognize, you know, we\u2019re seeing growth in the instrument consumables associated with our new tests, Catalyst SDMA on slide and the growing installed base of SediVue and the growing use of preventive care. So we have a number of growth drivers that make up the total Companion Animal diagnostic recurring revenue projected growth for 2019 of 11% to 12% on an organic basis. Erin Wright : Okay. Great. Thanks. And on the international side \u2013 I\u2019m going to ask another question on international reference lab \u2013 but when will the sales force more meaningfully kind of mature there? And how quickly is that relative to what you typically see kind of in the U.S.? And then how should we think about that quarterly cadence in international reference lab? When do you really expect that to start to improve over the course of the year? Thanks. Jonathan Ayers : I like to look at the results as a whole, and what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve prioritized the Catalyst placements to new and competitive accounts, which is a little bit harder sale than a Catalyst placement to an existing IDEXX chemistry customer using VetTest. And while we\u2019ve largely upgraded the VetTest volume in the international market, there are some -- I think it\u2019s 10% of our chemistry consumable volume in the international market because with VetTest remaining to go. This is \u2013 the 29% year-over-year growth I think is really showing that the international is prioritizing the highest ROI work. And let\u2019s recognize, once we place a Catalyst, the loyalty internationally on Catalyst is virtually 100%.  So these are going to be customers that are going to be using Catalyst for life, and this is very enduring recurring revenue let alone any growth we get in utilization from menu or utilization or adoption of additional protocols. We did see a nice \u2013 we saw a couple percent tick up in the international reference lab organic growth in Q4 over Q3 which really, I think, validates a part of what we saw in Q3 with weather. And part of it was some selective slowdown in markets as we prioritized those chemistry placements. To get to really where will the IDEXX 360 program and our overall focus on both Catalyst and reference lab, I would say that\u2019s probably going to \u2013 we\u2019ll probably see that in the second half of 2019 start to kick in. But the productivity of the sales force is already pretty high on the important instrument placement side of the equation. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Michael Ryskin : Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to dig deeper on a couple of the moving pieces and the updated 2019 guide, just to get some clarity. So I think you mentioned the CAG recurring revenues outlook you refined to 11% to 12% versus the 11.5% to 12.5%. It sounds like the accounting standard is now a little bit more; it\u2019s \u2013 I think you said 1.3 and previously is 1.0. So this is a bit of a two-parter question but I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s the entire reason for the shift and it\u2019s just a bit of a rounding decision. And then the second part of the question is if that\u2019s now 11% to 12% but the full \u2013 the total company guide is reiterated 9.5% to 11%. is there an offset somewhere else? It looks like LPD is still going to be challenged because of African swine fever. Is this something better in Water quality or is this just a rounding between the various buckets? Brian McKeon : Yeah, Mike. It really is kind of the rounding effects as we\u2019re just finalizing our plans would be \u2013 we try to provide input for each of the segments in the call, so we said low-teens CAG, high-single-digit Water and relatively flat LPD, and it really is a refinement finalizing our plan. It\u2019s not related to the accounting adjustment, and that kind of implies high-single-digit growth in areas like VSS and digital, and our instrument placement revenues, so it\u2019s just wrapping up our plans very much in-line with our trends coming out of the end of the year, if you look at the CAG recurring growth adjusted for that 1.3% effect, it\u2019s very consistent with that. We provided the extra decimal point. It\u2019s been slightly above 1% through the year. We\u2019ve just been rounding and we wanted you to have that exact number as we finished the year, but again that is a nonrecurring growth rate benefit. We should be through the accounting change adjustments and kind of fully normalized heading into 2019. Jonathan Ayers : Yeah, Mike, I think supportive of Brian\u2019s comments and your comments, I think you\u2019ve characterized it right. We\u2019re pretty unique in providing revenue and profit guidance in October of the year before for the following year which really shows the enduring and predictable nature of it, and really just as we finalize our plans and outlook, we\u2019re talking about some rounding considerations. Brian McKeon : And I would say we had an outlook in Q4 for the international labs of mid-to-high single-digit. We\u2019re a bit at the lower-end. We did see improvement, and some of that\u2019s factored in as well so we think that we\u2019ve got that well calibrated. Michael Ryskin : Okay. And then just if I could squeeze in one other quick one on the vet volume data you provided for 4Q, the .3% increase. I\u2019m just wondering if you saw anything weird in the U.S. in terms of whether in the quarter \u2013 we had the California wildfires in October, or if you think there\u2019s any potential impact there from some of the macroeconomic data, the GDP data that came out late in the year, the stock market had a negative move throughout the year, so I was wondering if you thought there was anything there that led to that decrease in vet clinic visits? Brian McKeon : It\u2019s a lot of moving parts. I would say, and then you have to throw in the calendarization, of December too, which with the holidays and where they fell. I think the .3% that\u2019s total visits we\u2019re getting a better understanding. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready to talk in detail about it yet but we\u2019re getting a better understanding of what portion of those visits are clinical visits and what the clinical visit trends are. Are preliminary analysis is clinical visits are closer to 2% of growth in Q4 and so some of that deceleration maybe really just revenue going from out of the practice management system into other channels. Some channels are channels that benefit the veterinarian through like the direct sales from the veterinarian, but doesn\u2019t go through the practice management software which is of course what we\u2019re measuring. So but I think the overall trends, and certainly our companion animal diagnostic recurring revenue growth of 13.3% in the U.S. speaks for the fact solid state of the growth in our portion of the industry. Michael Ryskin : All right. Much appreciated. I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will go to the line of John Block with Stifel. Your line is open. John Block : Great. Thanks, guys, and good morning. I\u2019ll ask also probably a couple of guidance-related questions. So Brian the first one I think if I heard you correctly the midpoint of the 1Q organic was about 9.75 with a 1% days headwind, that\u2019s largely in-line with the 9.5 to 11 organic for the year. So I guess where I\u2019m going with this is there anything to call out from a cadence perspective for the year on a top-line? Should we think stable and then maybe the Op margin expansion is a bit back-end weighted? Any color would be helpful. Brian McKeon : I think that\u2019s a fair call, John. I think we\u2019re not, I don\u2019t think we have any meaningful targeted calendarization differences or things to note. You always have segment by segment, specific compares but as we work through the year, but I think that\u2019s fair. And yes, on the operating margin, the full years 50 to 80 and we\u2019re likely at the lower-end of that coming out of the blocks, and some of that\u2019s just the lapping of the investments that we made on the commercial expansion. We\u2019re still advancing some of the international aspects of that, and as Jon, noted we\u2019ve got plans to increase our R&D spending this year as well, so that\u2019s all factored in, but we\u2019ll expect to build on that through the year. And I did note that we are targeting primarily improvement from gross margins this year, so that we expect that will be consistent too. John Block : Okay. Very helpful. And that\u2019s probably a good segue into the second question which is, Brian, I haven\u2019t pushed you on margin expansion for some time so maybe I\u2019ll go back for my second question. In 2017 and 2018 the Op margin expansion I believe was around 120 bps to 130 bps, guidance this year like you said is 50 to 80 bps. Obviously to be fair the baseline is higher now, but you have lapped a lot of investments notably in the sales force that you\u2019ve made over the past 12 months to 24 months and maybe at a high-level you can just speak to the incremental investments and why the amount of op margin expansion in 2019 would be more muted versus the past 12 months to 24 months? Thanks, guys. Brian McKeon : Yeah, it really is an operating expense story. We\u2019ve been highlighting the additional commercial expansions which will be, as I noted, lapping heading into this year. And the cash R&D metrics that Jon highlighted would imply closer to 15% growth in R&D this year. So we\u2019ve had very high return on our ongoing investment in the organic growth of the business, as highlighted by our 49% after-tax return on invested capital and\u2026 Jonathan Ayers : And then investable business. Brian McKeon : We are very pleased with the growth and want to keep investing towards that. And look, if we deliver at the higher end of our revenue goals which we\u2019ve had the last couple years, that can have some favorable flow-through benefits. But we\u2019re very comfortable with the outlook that we\u2019re providing at this point. Jon Block : Okay. And maybe one quick one, if I can. The quality of the beat was really high in the quarter. Notably, the R&D expense came in ahead of what we were looking for. You talked about, per your comments, Brian, solid R&D expectations for 2019. So Jon, maybe can you talk about the turnaround time, if that\u2019s a good term to use, for some of those projects? Would we expect that pipeline to materialize at all in 2019, or is that something more of a 2020 event? Thanks for your time, guys. Jonathan Ayers : Yeah, I\u2019m not going to talk about anything specific in the R&D pipeline that we haven\u2019t already talked about, but I do want to reinforce that some of our R&D, a significant portion of our R&D is about our products\u2019 expanding menu, advancing their capabilities. Not only do we have cloud-based software that\u2019s continually advancing, whether it\u2019s in our veterinary software and services, our digital imaging, or of course VetConnect PLUS, and R&D investments are going to that. So it\u2019s no big product launch, but it\u2019s a continual advancement in the capability that we\u2019re giving the customers, which of course supports recurring revenue growth. Our instruments are almost \u2013 you could consider them as, you know, cloud-based software. They\u2019re continually advancing behind the scenes for our customers, and this is the new model. Anyone who\u2019s got something powered by software better be continually advancing it through the cloud. I know that\u2019s what Tesla is doing on automobiles and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing for quite some time with now seven new menu items on Catalyst in seven years and the advancement in our hematology offering that we talked about over time with four new parameters on ProCyte and the advancements of the Neural Network, the incremental capability we have in IDEXX VetLab Station. So there\u2019s a steady diet of things that don\u2019t necessarily get a lot of individual play, but they have a very meaningful impact on the sustainability of our growth. And we have very a good pipeline across the diagnostic and software categories. Our R&D group is very \u2013 it\u2019s amazingly productive, combined with our knowledge of the business and our customer requirements and our ability to leverage and access and input third-party technology into our offering. So it\u2019s a continued part, as I\u2019ve said, with close to $150 million of cash R&D in diagnostics and software investment in 2019, we see this as a core part of IDEXX being the sole innovator in the industry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Mark Massaro : Hey, guys. Thanks, and congrats on a nice quarter. Jonathan Ayers : Thank you. Mark Massaro : My first question is on the mix between U.S. and OUS. So historically, your international growth has trended higher than your U.S. growth, largely given a lower base of business in international but also based on stronger trends OUS. When we think about Q4, in your prepared remarks, you talked about soft growth in select markets OUS, so can you just give us a sense of where those markets are and what your expectations are for OUS in 2019? Brian McKeon : Yeah, so, Mark, that was specifically a reference to international reference labs. So we had consumable growth in international. The 20% growth overall was strong across all of our markets. It was really exceptional performance. If you look at the instrument placement growth and the resulting\u2026 Brian McKeon : 20%-plus. We're very pleased with that progress this year. That was the key driver of the recurring revenue gains. As we\u2019ve been highlighting the mid-single-digit growth in reference labs, what we saw in Q4 was a recovery from the summer in some of our key markets and we don\u2019t like to highlight specific markets for competitive reasons, but we saw a recovery from some of the weather impacts that we had highlighted.  And we do continue to have relatively lower growth in some markets, and we think this is largely related to the fact that we really shifted the commercial focus on driving the high in-clinic gains this year and weren\u2019t as focused, not by intent, but just outcome on the reference lab business. We\u2019re working to get that back on track, and we expect it will be successful with that, and but it will take an annuity business, the growth rate is really a reflection of what\u2019s happened the last four quarters. So we\u2019ll hopefully be highlighting progress on that front. Jonathan Ayers : I do want to take the opportunity to \u2013 big shout-out to our German lab and our German commercial organization lab, of course, more than just Germany, but they really had a great Q4 across the board. That\u2019s a team we move to the veterinary diagnostic consulting model we have in the U.S. at the beginning of the year, and they\u2019ve really executed well. Of course, that is the largest lab, where we\u2019re building the new corn Westheim facility which you noted in the capital expansion. So I think we\u2019re putting the money where the performance, is and so that\u2019s the one market I\u2019d really give kudos to. Mark Massaro : Great. And then as we think about your new point-of-care progesterone test launching in the coming weeks ahead, I know you haven\u2019t raised your 2019 guidance. But can you give us a sense for the size of the market; how you intend to price, it whether it\u2019s a premium to other innovations, such as like SDMA in the slide, for instance? And what type of market potential you think there is for progesterone. Jonathan Ayers : Yeah, the list price of that test per test will be $34.99 in the U.S. market; obviously international markets, it\u2019s a little \u2013 it\u2019s going to be market-specific, so that is a very attractive list price, and. But it\u2019s really very small, direct contributor. I think what it is, is two things that are relevant to investors. One is this continues to advance both the loyalty of Catalyst customers and it gives us the opportunity to place a Catalysts that have a requirement to serve responsible breeders. And second, it\u2019s an indication that we\u2019re not done adding menu to our in-house instruments. And this is one of the things about our instrument platform; it\u2019s very flexible to menu addition because each life can be developed individually, and we have the capability to do that. Really puts us in a unique position in chemistry as well as hematology and urinalysis to continue to advance the installed base capability in what we call technology for life. Mark Massaro : Excellent. And then if I can, are you seeing competitive dynamic changes as a result of some of the consolidation in the space and Zoetis acquiring Abaxis? Just as we think about Abaxis becoming more meaningful in Europe and outside the U.S. do you see any changes to your strategy OUS this year? Jonathan Ayers : It\u2019s always been a competitive market. I would say with regard to major markets, the U.S. is the most competitive market. And as you can see is our \u2013 our loyalty, even with VetTest customers outside the U.S. is in the high-90s, so it\u2019s always been a competitive market. We don\u2019t really see any changes that have come to play that have been a consequence of the change in ownership of Abaxis. Operator : Thank you. Next we will go to the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Michael Ryskin : Thanks, guys. Just had a couple quick follow ups I wanted to throw in there. You mentioned the minus one selling day in the first quarter. Just for our modeling purposes, could you give us the days\u2019 impact throughout the rest of the year, and just to confirm there was no impact in 4Q of 2018? Jonathan Ayers : So 2019, we have a favorable day benefit in Q3, so and I think the other quarters are not material enough to highlight. Q4 we had a favorable day benefit, but we believe it was offset by the timing at the year-end of the Christmas and New Year's holiday, which really impacted kind of year-end, both Clinic activity but also our shipments, and so we didn\u2019t call that out as a factor because we really think it was weird offsetting effects there, so that was not an adjustment to our Q4 results. Michael Ryskin : Okay. I appreciate that, and then just the follow-up on one of the other questions I asked earlier about the international reference lab. Sounds like you had the improvement from the low single-digit to mid-single-digits in the quarter. I\u2019m just wondering you called out the relative focus of the sales force driving Point-of-Care versus Reference Lab. As we think through to 2019, how quickly should that move up? Is this something that is reasonable to think can take another step higher in 1Q? Or is this a little more gradual to get the international back to the more high-single-digit range? Jonathan Ayers : We, in the near-term, it will take time. So\u2026 Brian McKeon : I think we\u2019ll see gradual improvement over the course of the 2019. I think we are coming back to our German organization which moved to Veterinary Diagnostic Consultant model where you have one account manager representing in-house and Reference Lab. They moved to that in the first quarter of 2019, and they had a very good fourth quarter across-the-board and I think that really shows what happens when we get with a little bit of time and territory and learning the new model. I mean, every market is a little different. Some of them were already there. Some of them are making changes to that model. Some of them are Distributor markets where that\u2019s not really relevant, or markets where we don\u2019t have a Reference Lab business, so there\u2019s a lot of different models internationally, but I think that\u2019s an indication of what we expect to see over the course of 2019. Operator : Thank you. And our final question will come from the line of David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. David Westenberg : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. So the number, the Instrument placement number blew away my estimates, but the Instrument actual revenue number was a little bit below, at least in trend line. So is that a function of strong international placements? Or is there an increase in rental style contracts? Brian McKeon : It\u2019s a great question, David. It was up 3%, some of that is the compared to very strong results last year, we really had an exceptional Q4 in 2017, and the other factor we did note was Instrument program mix impacts, and as you pointed out, very strong performance internationally can drive, that and the growth of programs like rental programs internationally, and 360 can have an effect too on the Instrument revenue recognition. They\u2019re all great programs with a high-return, but can have a bit of a moderating affect on growth. So those were the primary drivers. Jonathan Ayers : Yeah, I also want to call out David. The U.S. did a great job. They had a tough compare where they were really rocking and rolling in Q4 2017. Q4 2018 was the first quarter of the expansion. Well the most recent expansion, and in the context of the strong compare, and the first quarter expansion, they had a very strong results, as Brian laid out, and were up year-over-year, so but to your point on revenue, there can be a program mix impacts. As I think international placements are going to generate \u2013 are generally small practices, that\u2019s a fair point, and so each placement generates a little bit less incremental recurring revenue than our U.S. placement, but having said that, I think we\u2019re very, very pleased with the Instrument placements globally in Q4. David Westenberg : Just maybe just one follow up on kind of the revenue build side. You had 17% consumable growth. That\u2019s a great number right there. Can you maybe help us parse out contribution from SDMA versus kind of organic consumption or consumable utilization and kind of help us understand really what SDMA on the slide is kind of doing there. Brian McKeon : Yeah, I highlighted that 4% of the consumable growth, the organic consumable growth, in Q4 was a combination of SDMA on a slide and SediVue paper run. They\u2019re pretty equal. I think we\u2019re both contributing I think round about 2%. Jonathan Ayers : And we\u2019re very pleased with the Catalyst SDMA adoption. We\u2019ve now topped a million runs on Catalyst with SDMA. This adds to the close to total 20 million of SDMA results when we include the reference lab. In the U.S., we have 58% of our practices who have run Catalyst SDMA in the last quarter and 64% who have purchased it. These are really amazing adoption metrics and of course, SDMA is unique to the IDEXX solution, so globally, the metrics are very similar. It\u2019s actually 58% adoption in the U.S. and 56% adoption meaning they\u2019re actually running it.  Of course, we can uniquely measure that because we have smart service on our instruments which brings all sorts of benefits, including our ability to measure and about 64% of global install base has purchased the SDMA. So these are -- in the first year launch, these are amazing adoption metrics, and it really shows the progress we\u2019ve made on providing education to the field of the importance of SDMA, as being highly correlated with GFR, meaning elevated SDMA, says something is going on and you need to look more closely, and you\u2019re not going to see that with traditional parameters, so it\u2019s a great story. We\u2019re going to continue with our investments in SDMA education as part of our 2019 marketing plans, but I\u2019m certainly pleased with the adoption rate and as we mentioned it also contributes to the organic instrument consumable revenue growth. Operator : With that, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Mr. Ayers for any closing comments. Jonathan Ayers : I want to thank everybody for calling in and I know we\u2019ve got some employees and other constituents and again I want to express my gratitude for really a fantastic 2018. We run the company in a way that delivers the day and secures the future, and I think we had a great delivery in the year, as we\u2019ve enumerated here on this call. And with the work that our employees do across the world, I think we also made significant progress in securing the future for IDEXX and our customers in the veterinary market, in the Water market, in the Livestock, Poultry and Dairy market and in the human blood gas market through our OPTI Medical systems. And so with that, we will conclude the call and get started on 2019. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation, and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.",

Participating in the call this morning are Jon Ayers, Chief Executive Officer; Brian McKeon, Chief Financial Officer; and John Ravis, Senior Director, Investor Relations. IDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements. Listeners are reminded that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the forward-looking statements notice in our press release issued this morning as well as in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website, idexx.com. During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website.  In reviewing our first quarter 2019 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth, constant-currency growth and comparable constant-currency growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2018 unless otherwise noted. To allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit his or her questions to one with one follow-up as necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we\u2019ll take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. IDEXX delivered continued high revenue growth and excellent financial results in the first quarter. In terms of highlights, we achieved 10% organic revenue growth driven by 12% organic gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. As expected, FX impacts from the strengthened U.S. dollar reduced reported revenue growth by about 3%.  Operating margins improved 210 basis points on a constant-currency basis, better than projected, reflecting strong gross margin gains and operating expense leverage, which benefited from high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth as well as timing delays related to select IT and R&D project spending. EPS was $1.17 per share, up 16% on a reported basis or 27% on a comparable constant-currency basis.  Strong revenue growth and operating margin gains drove 21% constant currency operating profit growth. We also recognized about $0.02 per share in upside related to higher than projected tax benefits from stock compensation activity. In terms of our full year guidance, we\u2019re maintaining our outlook for 9.5% to 11% organic revenue growth, reflected in our consistent guidance range of $2,385 billion to $2,425 billion in annual revenues. We\u2019re increasing over 2019 EPS guidance range by $0.10 to $4.76 to $4.88 per share. This incorporates an increase of about $0.07 from an updated outlook for 80 basis points to 110 basis points in full year constant-currency operating margin improvement, $0.01 to $0.02 per share and benefit from updated interest expense projections, and $0.01 to $0.02 in upside related to updated effective tax rate projections. Our operating margin outlook factors in additional investments were advancing this year and reference lab capacity, corporate customer support resources and customer-facing software capability while continuing to deliver a strong operating margin improvement and comparable constant currency EPS gains aligned with our long-term financial goals. We\u2019ll review our updated 2019 outlook later in my comments, let\u2019s begin with a review of our Q1 performance by segment and region. Q1 results were supported by continued strong performance in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were $509 million, up 10% organically by 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems revenues increased 7% overall and 6% organically with overall revenue gains constrained by comparison to very strong prior year digital imaging system placement levels.  Veterinary software services revenue grew at a high-single digit rates organically in Q1, reflecting very strong skills across \u2013 results across our practice management platforms with the continued growth of our PIMs and applications installed base supporting expansion of recurring software services revenue. Our digital imaging business continued to achieve high levels of digital radiography system placements and high growth in recurring Web PACS subscription revenue linked to our expending installed base.  Our Water business revenues grew 8% organically in the first quarter to $30 million, reflecting continued solid growth in the U.S. and double-digit gains in international markets. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue in Q1 was $32 million, up 4% organically. Gains in herd health screening, poultry and pregnancy products sales were offset by moderate declines in European disease eradication program revenues, continued market demand impacts on our dairy testing business and continued pressure on swine diagnostic testing revenues related to impacts from the African swine fever epidemic in China. By region, U.S. revenues were $358 million in the quarter up 9% organically, driven by 11% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, net of an approximate 1% equivalent day headwind. Strong U.S. gains reflected continued double-digit growth in reference lab and consumables and solid mid-single-digit growth in rapid assay sales. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains were primarily volume driven with U.S. net price gains continuing to trend in the 2% to 3% range.  In terms of our broader U.S. market trends, this quarter, we significantly revamped and expanded our reporting from our data set from approximately 7,500 practices, representing five different practice information management systems. We\u2019ve also refined our weighting framework based on practice as in region prepared in collaboration with Animalytix. We\u2019re now providing same-store growth in clinical visits for practice augmenting our quarterly reporting on total same-store visit and revenue growth for Companion Animal Veterinary visits of all types. In Q1, we saw improvement in total visits per practice growth to 1.3% year-on-year with clinical visits for practice growing at a greater amount of 2.2%, an overall revenue per practice growth of 5%. Please note that these metrics are on a same-store basis and do not include growth benefits from incremental practice formation, which we estimate at approximately 1% annually.  The Q1 2019 earnings snapshot on our website shows quarterly data on clinical visit growth for 2018 and Q1 2019 as well as some additional information we\u2019ve added that describes our measurement methodologies and refinements we made towards historical data to reflect the additional insight we\u2019ve gained from our data analysis efforts.  International revenue in Q1 were $218 million, up 11% organically. International results were driven by strong 14% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, including continued 20% plus organic growth in consumable revenues as we benefit from 30% year-on-year growth in our global catalyst install base outside of the U.S. We saw modest benefits from advanced ordering in the UK ahead of the Brexit deadline, which added approximately 2% to international consumable growth in Q1. International reference lab growth was in the mid-single digit range, as we continued to advance commercial efforts targeted on accelerating growth in this line of business, while sustaining strong momentum in expanding our catalyst install base in international markets. In terms of segment performance, Q1 results were supported by continued progress in driving catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts. The quality of our instrument placements were strong in Q1. We achieved 207 placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 7% with a higher tax rate of premium hematology instruments, which drove a solid increase in EVI, our measure of multiyear economic value of instrument placements. We also placed 122 second catalysts at IDEXX accounts in North America, compared to 59 in Q1 2018, supporting growth in customer utilization at larger accounts. Internationally, we placed 633 catalysts at new and competitive accounts, up 20%. By region, competitive and new catalyst placements represented 69% of total placements in North America and 62% internationally.  Strong catalyst placement results and continued high retention is reflected in 24% year-on-year growth in our global catalyst install base. Overall, we placed 2,775 premium analyzers in Q1, down 2% compared to very strong prior year levels. Q1 results were led by 1,463 catalyst placements globally, up 4% overall supported by 442 placement in North America, a 20% year-on-year increase. And 1,020 placements in international markets, down 1% compared to record prior year results, which included high levels of VetTest upgrades in emerging markets.  As noted, we saw a high attach rate of premium hematology instruments with chemistry placements in Q1, which supported 823 premium hematology instruments globally, up 9%. SediVue placements were 489 in Q1, down 26% versus very strong prior levels impacted by our exceptional SediVue placement performance in Q4 as well as our commercial focus in Q1 on capturing high EVI, new and competitive catalyst placement opportunities.  In addition to strong premium placement results, we drove continued momentum with SNAP Pro with 1,999 placements in the quarter. CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues in Q1 were $29 million, a 3% decrease organically of a tough compare in 2018, which included mix benefits from very strong placements of higher price SediVue instruments.  Benefits from an expanding instrument base, test innovation and enhanced commercial capability continue to drive strong CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains across our major modalities. Instrument consumable revenues of $167 million grew 15% organically in Q1. Results reflected double-digit gains in the U.S. and continued 20% plus growth in international markets. High volume-driven consumer gains continue to be supported by expansion of SediVue paper run and estimates live revenues, which contributed approximately 3% combined to year-on-year consumable revenue gains in the quarter.  Reference lab and consulting services with revenues of $203 million grew 11% organically in the first quarter. U.S. lab momentum remains strong reflected in solid double-digit volume-driven organic revenue gains, supported by expansion of our preventative care programs. As noted, International reference lab growth was in the mid-single digit range supported by solid gains in Europe. Rapid assay revenues of $54 million grew 6% organically in Q1 reflecting solid gains across U.S. and international markets. Rapid assay gains were primarily volume-driven supported by growth in 40x plus and first generation products. Turning to the P&L. Operating profit in Q1 was $133 million, up 18% as reported, or 20% on a constant currency basis, reflecting profit gains across our CAG, Water and LPD segments. Operating margins were 23.1%, up 210 basis points on a constant-currency basis, supported by solid gross margin gains and operating expense leverage. Gross profit was $332 million in Q1, up 9% as reported or 12% on a constant-currency basis. Gross margins increased to 110 basis points on a constant-currency basis, supported by continued moderate CAG Diagnostic net price gains, volume leverage and productivity gains and our U.S. reference lab business, mix benefits from high consumable growth as well as solid gross margin improvement in our Water and LPD businesses.  Foreign exchange hedge gains, which are reflected in gross profit were $1.4 million in Q1. Operating expenses in Q1 were up 4% or 7% on a constant-currency basis, resulting in 100 basis points of positive operating margin leverage. Operating expense increases were driven by growth in CAG, sales and marketing and R&D spending with overall spending increases mitigated by modest constant-currency growth and G&A cost, including benefits from later phasing and certain IT-related projects.  EPS in Q1 was $1.17 per share, an increase of 16% as reported and 27% on a comparable constant-currency basis. Foreign exchange, net of hedge impacts in Q1 2018 and 2019 decreased operating profit by $4 million and EPS by $0.03 per share. Our effective tax rate was 17.7% in Q1, including benefits of 4.4% to our tax rate or $0.06 per share related to share-based compensation activity, which was approximately $0.02 per share higher than projected. Free cash flow was minus $4 million for Q1, reflecting normal quarterly seasonality and increased capital spending related to major projects. We continue to maintain our full year outlook for free cash flow of approximately 60% to 65% of net income for 2019 and a $160 million to $170 million in capital spending, which includes approximately 20% of free cash flow impact, driven by $70 million of combined incremental capital spending related to Westbrook, Maine headquarter expansion and our German Core Lab relocation.  We allocated $54 million in capital for repurchases of 267,000 shares in Q1. We ended Q1 with $1,052 billion in debt, including $100 million of the new tenure notes issued in the quarter. Our liquidity remains strong with a $117 million in cash and $502 million in capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 1.69 times gross and 1.5 times net of cash and investment balances. We\u2019re maintaining our 2019 full year outlook for reduction in average shares outstanding from stock repurchases of 1% to 1.5%, which assumes net leverage at 1.5 times EBITDA. We\u2019re now projecting annual interest expense, net interest expense of $36 million incorporating a more favorable full year interest rate outlook. Turning to our 2019 guidance, we\u2019re reinforcing our full year revenue outlook, while raising our EPS range by $0.10 per share. Our full year reported revenue guidance remains $2,385 million to $2,425 million, reflecting consistent expectations for 9.5% to 11% overall organic growth and 11% to 12% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. Our reported revenue Outlook reflects a consistent projected 1.5% full year FX revenue growth headwind at the rates assumed in our press release. We\u2019re raising our 2019 full year EPS guidance, $0.10 per share to $4.76 to $4.88 or 16% and 19% growth on a comparable constant currency basis. This incorporates a 30 basis point increase in our outlook for constant currency operating margin improvement now estimated at 80 to 110 basis points for the full year, resulting in approximately 7% \u2013 $0.07 per share in improvement in our EPS guidance range. We\u2019ve also refined our outlook for net interest expense and stock compensation tax benefits, which combined at approximately 3% to our full year EPS \u2013 $0.03 to our full year EPS range. We\u2019ve updated our outlook for 2019 effective tax rate to 20% to 20.5%, including an updated estimate of $8.5 million to $10.5 million or approximately 2% in full year projected tax rate benefit from exercise of share-based compensation. We estimate that foreign exchange rate gains will decrease reported EPS by $0.03 per year, net of approximately $11 million in projected hedge gains. For the second quarter, we expect reported revenue growth of 7% to 8.5% and organic revenue gains of 9% to 10.5% supported by consistent 11% to 12% CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains. We expect Q2 operating margins to be approximately 50 basis points higher than prior year levels on a constant currency basis. This outlook incorporates the re-phasing of plan for staff investments, impacts of higher international commercial staffing levels and incremental investments in select areas including increases to our U.S. VetLab capacity. We expect our effective tax rate in Q2 to be approximately 21.5%, including projected benefits from share-based compensation exercise activity. That concludes the financial overview. Let me turn the call over to Jon for his comments. Jon Ayers : Thank you, Brian. Now a little color commentary. We had a strong start in 2019 in the first quarter with organic revenue growth of 10% and comparable constant currency EPS gains of 27% supported by better than expected margin gains. Globally, we delivered a solid 12% organic growth in our CAG diagnostic recurring revenues at the higher end of our full year growth rate with strong gains across the U.S. and international regions. This expanding highly durable annuity contributed 77% of IDEXX\u2019s total revenues in Q1. Instrument placements globally considering both quality and quantity together, we\u2019re solid with strength in the U.S., Europe and Latin America offset by year-over-year declines in Asia Pacific, primarily related to tough comparisons. Our premium install base continues to expand at high rates and we do not see any change in the competitive environment. In Q1, our U.S. field organization was in the second quarter of the latest territory expansion. And so we saw strong momentum in placements of catalysts in new and competitive accounts up 7% as our field organization expires customers to trade up to IDEXX\u2019s advanced technology offering. We also had an exceptional quarter with SNAP Pro placements of almost 2,000, driven by the U.S. up 68% year-over-year. We are methodically transforming our rapid assay customer base into a razor and blade business model. As a SNAP Pro mobile instrument brings significant workflow and charge capture value to the veterinary practice. And we\u2019re seeing higher growth and rapid assay loyalty when customers adopt SNAP Pro workflow. With placements in Q1, we\u2019re now well over 60% of our SNAP 4Dx coming from active and connective SNAP Pro customers. Despite tough comparisons to high prior year SediVue placements, new and competitive catalysts and SNAP Pro gave supported solid growth in the U.S. economic value index in the quarter. They really did a great job. Europe also saw strong \u2013 solid Q1 growth in catalyst placements and instrument placement value, which is impressive given they are in their first quarter of the field sales expansions. The European expansions are on their way to completion at 92% occupancy. However, 40% of field reps are in their first year. And as a result, sales productivity in Europe will be building through 2019 as field experience and time and territory advances. This is the same dynamic we saw in the U.S. when we undertook a similar major expansion in 2015. The U.S. Companion Animal market is on very solid footing as is the pet owner in general based on macro and the trends we see. We are excited to be presenting this quarter a much expanded and improved market growth reporting as shown on the second page of our earnings snapshot with an upgrade to our methodology and an expansion in the number of practice of 7,500 in total coming from a variety of both IDEXX and third-party Practice Management System. Additionally, weighted to reflect the market in terms of geography and practice size and type with the support of Animalytix and we\u2019re grateful for their partnership. We\u2019re giving back to the industry by publishing these important metrics on a quarterly basis, as part of our earnings. This is an industry with otherwise limited to no market data of this kind. Of course, the data also helps investors understand IDEXX a little bit better. From this data, we\u2019re seeing 2.2% clinical visit growth from existing practices in Q1 to get to total market visit growth, we need to add the impact of net new practice formation, which we estimate to be about 1%. Pet care in the U.S. is a very healthy market with existing veterinary practices making investments in technology and infrastructure and new practices being opened. Our growth of the Companion Group diagnostics recurring revenue in the U.S. was 11% in Q1, net of about 1% equivalent day headwind. We are and have been growing faster, our diagnostic volume than patient visit growth for several reasons. First, we\u2019re seeing same \u2013 strong same-store sales in diagnostic volume growth beyond clinical visit growth, driven by our unique innovations and our focus on driving ongoing increases in the utilization diagnostics and pet care. Across our modalities, we estimate this adds about 4% of incremental volume to clinical visit growth. To this, you add another 2% growth in the number of new practices that are utilizing IDEXX as their primary diagnostic partner, whether it be in-house, reference lab or both, call this customer share gain, if you will. In fact, we topped 20,000 practices sending at least one sample at the IDEXX reference labs and Q1, our record for this metric in Q1. We also continue to realize 2% to 3% net price realization in Companion Animal diagnostic recurring revenue. So added all up 9% volume growth from a variety of sources and 2% to 3% new price realization gets us to low teens Dx recurring revenue in the U.S. aligned with the high end of our long-term U.S. growth potential of 9% to 13%. Same-store sales at the practice level is being driven in part by the adoption of IDEXX\u2019s fecal offering and by preventative care diagnostics, what we call the Preventative Care Challenge or PCC. To-date, through Q1, nearly 2,800 practices have enrolled in PCC program since its inception with over 300 new practices enrolled in the quarter. These 2,800 practices are growing IDEXX diagnostics at just under 15% on a trailing 12-month basis. Preventative care is a great example of how we are creating new market growth with our innovations incorporated into reference lab PCC profiles, all of which include at a minimum IDEXX SDMA with the chemistry, the IDEXX CBC, fecal antigen and IDEXX\u2019s 4Dx offering. Together, they make an IDEXX PCC panel, a well justified annual pet owner investment in their pet \u2013 in the pet\u2019s health by uncovering underlying disease as part of a wellness visit. Just think it this way. Running a PCC panel on a pet as part of an annual physical exam is like a human getting a physical with blood work every seven years. The only difference is that the blood work is even more important in pet care as the pet can\u2019t speak for themselves. And we\u2019ve got these dogs running around dog parks sniffing around and drinking from the puddles. It\u2019s just a different situation and we\u2019re finding there\u2019s a lot of value. When a veterinary practice partners with IDEXX, with our proprietary PCC panels, their overall practice revenue growth accelerates generally without the addition of any staff. Clearly, 2019 is the year where preventative care diagnostics driven by the expanded capabilities of IDEXX\u2019s unique offering is moving into the mainstream of veterinary medicine to the benefit of the veterinary practice, pets, owners and IDEXX\u2019s alike. And yet, we believe IDEXX is only serving 10% of the total addressable market for preventative care. We also see nice same-store sales growth in the VetLab consumables business from the adoption of new menu, including catalysts SDMA, SediVue and now catalyst progesterone. Customer retention rates in the U.S. remain stable and Q1 at world-class levels of 98% to 99%. In an environment where our competitors use they\u2019re only weapon price to compete, it\u2019s nice to see our customers do not equate price with the value and evidence the value of our innovations through their loyalty. New Product launches in the quarter included catalysts progesterone, which is off to a strong start, both U.S. and internationally. France led the launch helping to expand the availability of poodles. We completed the update of all SediVue in the field with the newest algorithm, Neural Network 4.0 benefit of our internet of things strategy with our instruments. And veterinary software \u2013 in the veterinary software portfolio, we released Cornerstone 9.1 to great excitement and rave reviews. This new release brings a transformed user experience that is more intuitive and reduces clicks and we\u2019re seeing a more rapid take up of this new release as a result. We had strong placements of new Cornerstone, Neo, Animana and Smart Flow systems in the quarter. In addition, this month we formally announced the prospective availability of a cloud version of Cornerstone, for our customers who value the deep and unique functionality of Cornerstone as the go-to, high end practice management software, but also want the benefits of the cloud, such as full mobile access. We\u2019re seeing strong adoption in our IDEXX Web PACS, our cloud-based software-as-a-service offering with its new reference image library and the ability to work with both IDEXX digital imaging systems as well as those from third parties. Total Web PACS subscriptions have seen a 40% growth year-over-year, other software offerings from IDEXX are advancing nicely, including Petly Plans for wellness plans enterprise to support our corporate customers and of course, IDEXX VetConnectPLUS, which continues to make steady advancement in both functionality utilization. It is indeed a comprehensive and impressive IDEXX software technology stack. We\u2019re serving a growth market and supporting further market growth through our advanced diagnostics and software technologies. Given our success, we have in the works augmented and investments planned in the North American market, including reference lab capacity expansion, corporate account support resources, and further investments in our customer facing software strategies. Of no \u2013 we have no plans for further expansion of our field based footprint in the U.S. or internationally in 2019, in diagnostics other than completing the orchids, the occupancy plans in Europe, and a small expansion to serve corporate accounts. With these investments, we\u2019re focusing on the remainder of 2019 on driving field sales productivity, which comes from time and territory advancing our CRM and advancing programs such as EVI and IDEXX 360. In summary, we see very solid trends in our markets globally in 2019 and remain on track to advance our strategy of investments to further our innovation agenda, such as our outlook for about $150 million in cash R&D. While delivering our \u2013 on our 2019 revenue goals and an augmented outlook of 16% to 19% comparable constant currency EPS gains for the year. And Kevin, with that, I\u2019ll open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Ryan Daniels of William Blair. Please go ahead. Ryan Daniels : Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and all the detail. Brian, one for you. Operating margins clearly stronger than anticipated. And I think you mentioned in your comments, there were some IT and maybe R&D spending that was delayed. So can you dive into a little bit more the rationale behind that? Was it related to personnel hiring, given the economy or just the noise in investment spending? And then number two, anything we need to think about regarding cadence in those items for the rest of the year on a quarterly basis. Brian McKeon : Thanks, Ryan. On the project spending, it was just a normal executional timing. It wasn\u2019t a change in plans, but just when we were able to execute some of the IT and R&D project spends. We\u2019re still on track as Jon highlighted for the cash R&D spending goals this year, which are about a 15% increase. And so that will face in relatively more through Q2 through Q4. And we\u2019ll also continue to execute in the IT front. So it was more just a timing versus our estimates.  I would highlight that in Q1, we had some favorability that benefited the quarter. We had some favorable compares in our LPD business on the gross margin line. We had very strong consumable growth in particularly in international, some of that benefited we highlighted there was some Brexit pull forward. That added a couple of points to growth and we\u2019ve got some mix benefits from those factors.  And as we work through the years, we\u2019ve highlighted today, we\u2019ll have some incremental investments going coming online in the second quarter will be adding some day lab capacity in the U.S., and that\u2019s factored into our margin outlook balance of the year. So we are clearly feeling good about how the year started. We raised the full year operating margin goal, but I think some of those factors will moderate the gains as we work through the year. Ryan Daniels : Okay, very helpful color. And then Jon, my follow-up will be for you in regards to the international sales force. Can you talk a little bit more about what you\u2019ve seen in regards to their ramp relative to the United States? I know you said 40% are within that first year. So I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a nice ramp curve and maybe there\u2019s confounding factors like moving to IDEXX 360 and some of the other initiatives that make a little hard to gauge versus historical levels. But what would you anticipate in regards to the productivity of that salesforce is it both expands and matures? Jon Ayers : Yes. I think that\u2019s a good question. I think it\u2019s going to international expansions that they will \u2013 we will see the productivity build over the course of your. Obviously, we\u2019ve got a phenomenal product line and we\u2019ve demonstrated that with placements around the world. And it just gets better as we add to it with things like with progesterone and of course, the regular software updates that go to all of our instruments as part of our smart service strategy. But its \u2013 the sales expansion, so I would see this was a very major expansion. And we undertook over the last four months to six months, yes, internationally in selected markets. Obviously we had a very strong, we have very strong country organizations there already. But I would say this expansion was kind of more \u2013 for them, was more in the order of expansion that we undertook in 2015 in the U.S. and so I would use that as a guide, how we think things will progress over the year. Ryan Daniels : Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : Next question is from the line of Erin Wright, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Erin Wright : Great, thanks. You highlighted again in the prepared remarks around the preventative care challenge program, and can you give us a sense on when that will contribute more to financials, if there\u2019s anything embedded in your guidance for 2019? Or if there\u2019s any other metrics, I think you gave some in your prepared remarks that we can track on a quarterly basis just to measure the success and progress of your efforts on the preventative care front? Thanks. Jon Ayers : Thank you. We \u2013 that\u2019s a great question. That is contributing to the 11% reported growth in the U.S. recurring revenue, which had a day of headwind in it. So that that\u2019s \u2013 that is a \u2013 the preventive care is a big deal. And the evidence, the medical evidence for preventative care is getting stronger and stronger as we put together that the data and we share it with the industries and the key opinion leaders. And our field organization, I mean this is one of the reasons why we\u2019ve done all of these expansions. They are bringing it to the local practice.  So we\u2019re adding every quarter a couple of hundred practices who are moving to this new way of thinking. They\u2019re all being threatened by the retail going out of the practice. And so they\u2019re realizing that is a turned to diagnostics, that\u2019s not only a nice anecdote, but it\u2019s a higher, it\u2019s a more productive, it\u2019s higher, so more satisfying and financially impactful way to grow the practice. Then retail, it has higher margins. And it\u2019s a whole lot more satisfying to address issues early then that deal with them very late in their progression with the pet.  And so I think we\u2019re beginning to see significant momentum of 2,800 practices. That\u2019s approaching 10% of the market. That is not a insubstantial demonstration of the success of this program. And yet, of course, we\u2019re really only early days. We think every practice really should be adopting this as a best practice over time. They\u2019ve got the tools and the support of our field organization to do so. Erin Wright : Okay, great. And then you gave some great data points on the underlying market demand trends in the U.S. I\u2019m curious if you keep track of some of those metrics overseas in terms of same-store sales volume trends. And if so, kind of directionally here how we should be thinking about the underlying health of the international CAG market. Are you seeing a broader presence from competitors that can also help drive awareness and advanced practice protocols in Europe as well as more broadly internationally? Thanks. Jon Ayers : Yes, thank you. We\u2019re really pleased to be able to present in partnership with Animalytix, the much more sophisticated U.S. metrics. And as we all know, there\u2019s just like almost no data in this industry and there are reasons for that. It\u2019s because, it\u2019s not \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have the standardization we see in human healthcare. In practice management systems, we found 790 different ways to call a dog, a dog. It\u2019s pretty amazing. So our machine learning AI is really coming into play here. With regard to the comparison to international, we just, we aren\u2019t there yet. We don\u2019t have that that same capability. But generally speaking, they\u2019re the same pets and people love their pets. And the level of adoption of diagnostics is still a fraction. And so we\u2019re bringing intention, but certainly any intention that the industry brings to the profession of the value of diagnostics we think will help grow the market around the world. And clearly we\u2019re seeing that with the double-digit growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues that we\u2019re seeing routinely outside the U.S. somewhere to the more advanced market that we have in the U.S. And it\u2019s really not \u2013 it\u2019s really a phenomenon and the cuts across all cultures and geographies. And really it\u2019s the amount of the attention that we can bring support of course, by a great product line that\u2019s going to drive this growth, which is why we\u2019ve done these expansions internationally to accelerate the adoption of diagnostics in the practice of veterinary medicine. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next question from the line of Michael Ryskin by Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Ryskin : Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. A few quick ones, just to follow-up on some of the things you highlighted earlier. You mentioned some stocking in the UK tied up with the Brexit, I think you said 2% to international consumables growth. So I\u2019m thinking that\u2019s about 65 to 70 bps to total consumables in the quarter. So make sure that\u2019s correct and sort of, what\u2019s your expectation for that throughout the rest of the years, that belief that that\u2019s going to fade or sort of reverse in 2Q or if you could just tell us how that factors into your outlook. Jon Ayers : That is correct. The number was 2% international\u2026 Michael Ryskin : International consumable, that\u2019s exactly correct. Jon Ayers : And that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re weighted towards the U.S. and consumables relatively. but I think that\u2019s \u2013 those are reasonable estimates on the overall effect. And we\u2019ll see, we don\u2019t have full insight into how the many customers, we have an international markets are that you take\u2026 Michael Ryskin : Correct, perhaps it will evolve. Jon Ayers : Exactly. But we were anticipating there was a high level of concern obviously, with the uncertainty in Q1 and we\u2019d anticipate some pullback in Q2, but it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ll see how that plays out. We don\u2019t have full visibility into that at this point. Michael Ryskin : Okay, thanks. And then another quick one, on the instrument revenues, I think you mentioned sort of the disconnect, where revenues were down I think 3% organically, but you saw a pretty solid placements across the board. You mentioned some mix in terms of a tough comp onset of you year-over-year, and how that played into the dynamic, but I was wondering \u2013 and then you could say sort of on an apples-to-apples basis, how\u2019s pricing and instruments you mentioned? I think it was positive for the CAG overall, but I want to focus on what\u2019s going on in the capital equipment side of things? Jon Ayers : Yes. I would say it\u2019s similar \u2013 similar dynamics. We had different metrics we can look at on that front. But I think the amount of cash that we put out for, in support of instrument placement programs on a quarterly basis was kind of in line with the trend we had last year. We did have a couple of tough compares in the quarter, set of view, we had an exceptional year last year and we had very strong placements in Q4 and our organization was really focusing Q1 on the big new \u2013 the competitive placement opportunities, which you saw on the quality of the numbers that we posted there. So that was one factor. Another one that we\u2019ll see going into the second quarter as well as we had very strong vet crit test upgrade results in international markets including China last year. And so just on an absolute revenue basis, we\u2019re up against tough for compares, but net-net, we\u2019re shifting a lot of our focus towards the competitive placements and that\u2019s helping us on the EBI front. So, we feel very good about the quality of the growth and just to reinforce, we pointed out that year-on-year, we\u2019ve got a 24% increase in our Catalyst installed base globally. So, that\u2019s the big driver of our consumable gains and we have great momentum there and we\u2019re feeling very good about that and that\u2019s where we\u2019re confident in reinforcing the outlook for the year. Brian McKeon : Yes. And I just want to do a color commentary, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re asking that question that Mike and highlighting that. We really, we run the business on the economic value of the instrument placement, which of course, includes the pricing of the instrument and the instrument revenues, but also includes our estimate of the economic value of the annuity, associated with that placement.  And so we don\u2019t run it based on instrument revenues. So that would be the wrong way to think about the business. It\u2019s about creating value with each quarter. And it was a very solid and positive growth in the value of those placements, and it was really, to put it in one word, it was really mixed up that has the revenues a little bit different than the value. Michael Ryskin : Very helpful. Thanks guys. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead. Jon Block : Thanks. Good morning. I\u2019ll start with gross margins, they were up real strong at 120 bps. I haven\u2019t seen sort of that level, I don\u2019t believe of year-over-year gross margin expansion since the first half of 2017. But Brian, some of that expansion was from the other businesses. You called it out in bid, but Water and LPD gross margins were up around 400 bps to 500 bps year-over-year. So, if you can talk to what drove that and is that step function to the new level largely sustainable in those divisions going forward? Brian McKeon : I think it is, yes. We should have continued good gross margin performance across the different businesses. I would highlight some factors that are benefiting us in Q1 in LPD. We did a very strong health herd screening, revenues which are relatively higher margin in that business. And that is that \u2013 we don\u2019t anticipate that same level of growth as we\u2019re moving forward and some of that was a compare. We had some higher costs last year as well. So, I think it\u2019s a \u2013 the year-over-year growth, Jon, we anticipate some moderation in that dynamic, but I think we\u2019re confident that we can sustain a good margin performance we\u2019ve had in the business. And water continues to be a very healthy business for us. And I think we\u2019re \u2013 we hope to build on that. I \u2013 we are obviously expecting this year gross margin to be a key driver of our overall performance. The 80 basis points to 110 basis points improvement and we expected the bulk of that to be delivering by gross margins, but there will be some moderation as we as we move forward including in the next quarter just as we advanced some of the investments that we talked about and we have some of the mixed dynamics changing as well. But we think, we\u2019ve captured that in our full-year outlook. Jon Ayers : Just one more thing Jon, I really \u2013 I want to call out, I was very pleased \u2013 that we\u2019re very pleased with the reference lab, a gross margin performance in the herd. And as you know that the U.S. has really been very well with the double-digit growth that is higher than our global 11% in the reference lab organically. It\u2019s really being led by the U.S., it\u2019s very, very successful part of our strategy. We\u2019re seeing nice gross margin growth there. Of course, we\u2019re reinvesting some of that for expanded capacity to really continue to provide an exceptional service level across all geographies in the U.S. and we\u2019ve called that out as an incremental investment in balance of the year. Jon Block : Got it, very helpful. And just a pivot to my second one here, I didn\u2019t find the instrument figures to surprising. And as you mentioned, clearly where these boxes go dictate the future annuity, but the set of you down 26% year-over-year on a global basis was a surprise to me. I believe the in clinic urine sediment might be around 15% penetrated in the U.S. give or take. So Jon, you know, a couple of years into the U.S. SediVue launch. How do you view the peak penetration rate of in-clinic urine sediment, and put it in perspective of hematology and chemistry, which might be closer to 70% and 90%, respectively. Thanks guys. Jon Ayers : Yes, thank you. First of all, the SediVue to-date has mostly been a North American product area and it\u2019s been driven by North America. And we continue to see that, that could be in the case in the near future. Our North American organization, particularly, our U.S. organization, it just had a very strong quarter in competitive catalysts, okay. Those are \u2013 they have that lot \u2013 adds a lot of economic value. Those are in some ways more challenging than even SediVue. And so we have the remaining SediVue opportunity in front of us that we\u2019ve talked about, probably over 30,000 analyzers, when we compare what SediVue penetration could be in relation to chemistry and hematology. I think we\u2019ve laid those numbers out in conversation with investors in the past. And so really there\u2019s no \u2013 we don\u2019t really see any change in the ultimate opportunity for SediVue penetration. And we really, really remain a class by our own with regard to SediVue and keeps getting better, that the Neural Network 4.0, which just is silent upgrade that went across our entire installed base, but a new menu and a greater overall experience. And we\u2019re not done yet with continued software investments in SediVue. And our customers know SediVue just gets better and better. So I think, it was a quarter where the field worked on the competitive catalyst placements. And I got to tell you, I was pretty proud of our accomplishments in that regard. Also, Jon, one more thing. I know you\u2019ve talked about it in the past. You got to be impressed with that 68% year-over-year growth in SNAP Pro placements. I mean, that\u2019s really turning out to be a great strategy. And of course, that\u2019s also takes a field effort to accomplish. Operator : Next question is from the line of Mark Massaro of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. Mark Massaro : Hey guys, thanks for the questions and congratulations to your team for putting together this really large dataset. I wanted to ask if you could maybe help me, think of where the additional 2,500 practices of data came from. I think, you reported out 5,000 previously. And then this is probably nitpicking, but last quarter I think you called, 30 basis points of increase and it looks like you revised that down to 30 basis points of decrease. Is that largely a function and I\u2019m referring to Q4 total visit growth. Is that largely a function of the additional practice data? Or was there were something else revised like geographic location changes. Jon Ayers : Yes. Let me first \u2013 take the first part of your question, and then Brian can answer the second part. So the 7,500 practices includes, while the 5,000 always included practices beyond our Cornerstone, which is go to PIMs. We\u2019ve greatly expanded the number of practices across the five major practice information management systems that are out there, only some of which are ours and some of which are third-party. And in addition, not only that, we haven\u2019t just taken a straight growth, we\u2019ve weighted the growth across these practice by segmenting them and getting them proportionally represented to the market, in terms of geography. We may have more in one geography than another, but we\u2019ve adjusted for that. And it\u2019s really been with a supportive Animalytix that we\u2019ve been able to do that weighting. So really it is a comprehensive revamp and we\u2019ve been able to apply our machine learning algorithms to figure out what are the clinical visits versus what I would call maybe the retail or non-clinical service visits, such as boarding and grooming, which of course, these are the higher quality visits and they\u2019re the ones that have a diagnostics and prescribed medications, so veterinary services that involved the veterinarian. So these are the more important \u2013 and they get more important business, so they give greater visibility. So I think long-term trends. Brian, you want to\u2026 Brian McKeon : Yes. And the \u2013 to Jon\u2019s point, we\u2019ve refine the methodologies and to make this even more accurate and just went back in time and adjusted the prior data to be consistent with that. So you\u2019ll see some minor changes in the historical data, but it\u2019s all intended to be apples. Jon Ayers : I think we look at this practice visit growth at the clinical level, not including net new practice formation, which we do not capture in this information, because we\u2019re looking at same-store sales year-over-year. I think, we see a very robust market. I would generalize, stepping apart from the quarter as a whole, I think we\u2019re seeing in same-store sales 2.5% to approaching 3% on a sustainable basis, practice visit growth on a same-store sales basis. And as we said, we had estimated that about 1% of that. Brian McKeon : So I think it\u2019s very healthy market and it\u2019s nice to see the first quarter. It does bounce around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter, but I was nice to see the first quarter metrics. Mark Massaro : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And then as more and more animal clinics choose to join larger groups, the value of these contracts become increasingly important. Can you just speak to, how you feel you\u2019re positioned as \u2013 maybe some of your competitors may have won some large deals, whether it\u2019s three or four years ago, some of these might be up for renewal. Can you just speak to the opportunities, in front of you and how you think your positions going forward? Jon Ayers : Thank you. We think we\u2019re exceptionally well positioned and we have very high loyalty among our corporate practices. Our corporate practices value us for a couple of reasons. First of all, we helped them drive same-store sales growth, which just has a very nice drop through benefit in a practice that has high fixed cost leverage. Diagnostics is a great place to improve both the revenue and the profitability. And our field reps along with our technologies such as preventative care and the underlying diagnostic technologies and better than preventative care drive same \u2013 help them drive same-store sales growth. Second, the number one issue that corporate practices had his staff engagement and retention. It\u2019s hard to recruit in the current environment. And the staff likes our products and they\u2019re very loyal to our products and they \u2013 and our corporate practices appreciate on that. And so they really want to be able to support the local staff with the best technology. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why we have such high loyalty, because they acquire practices with our products and they keep them. And if they decide to take them out that really usually has a pretty negative impact on engagement, which can lead to issues on staff retention, which of course has a pretty dramatic impact on the economics of that practice. So you lose a key producer and you\u2019ve got to go find someone that\u2019s not a pleasant experience. So our model works in the corporate and you can see it in our recurring revenue growth even in the period of the slow evolution of the industry to a larger corporate sector. Our recurring revenue growth is quite strong in that regard and those loyalty factors that I mentioned in my prepared remarks of 98% to 99%. That\u2019s all in, that\u2019s individual and corporate all embedded. Mark Massaro : Great. And if I can sneak one last one in, you performed more or less strong across the board and kind of in line with consensus for Q1. On the reference lab segment, you are going up against tough comps from the first half of last year. And I think we\u2019ve kind of saw the growth rate sort of moderate based on the comp. But in particular on OUS, came in at mid single digits. How should we think about the underlying demand of OUS reference lab? And can you speak to whether or not this might change when the Germany eat reference lab opens? Jon Ayers : All right. We are on track with opening the new core lab in Germany, which will really replace existing lab in Q1 of 2020. I think your comments are correct with regard to first half and second half for a comparison on the international reference lab. I think it\u2019s all part of that growing the highest and most productive use of these reps is placing instruments, because that\u2019s got very, very \u2013 that\u2019s a very, very profitable business for us. But of course, we are growing our labs too. And so it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s putting all that together, there\u2019s some time experience to pull that off. And so we\u2019ve got moderated expectations on the reference lab impact of the expansion in relation to what we hope to achieve with regard to instrument placements. Operator : Next question is from the line of Andrew Cooper of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Andrew Cooper : Hey guys, thanks for the questions. Just a couple for me. Kind of to the point that I think Jon was asking about, when we think about the margin dynamics that, that we saw in 1Q and then the increase in the guide. It looks like these relative to what we had modeled really the bulk of the outperformance is in one queue. And there\u2019s not a whole lot of change in the rest of the year. So just any color you could provide on sort of how some of that fell versus your expectations and how much is \u2013 to his question, a sustainable step up in the gross margins as opposed to a little bit more of a one-off in the first quarter. Brian McKeon : We did see more benefit than we anticipated. And some of it we tried to highlight here. I think the broader theme is we\u2019re on track, we\u2019re reinforcing the four year outlook, we\u2019re flowing that through. And maintaining our outlook while we\u2019re advancing some investments that we didn\u2019t have for outlook. So I think it was number of things moved in a good direction in Q1 and we are talk to what their full year goals and it\u2019s all aligned with the long-term goals we have for operating margin improvement. But I think you\u2019re right. There were some upside there that we\u2019re not projecting out in the balance of the year. Jon Ayers : This is \u2013 generally speaking, this is an amazing business with very, very high ROIC. It\u2019s an investible business. And so we are continuing to invest for sustained long-term growth in the profitable and enduring recurring revenue. So we look our plans, of course, extend way beyond the year 2019. And it was really factored into what we shared with you as our outlook for the year is the maximizing the growth and the value to our customers and our investors over a five year or five year plus timeframe. Andrew Cooper : That\u2019s helpful. I guess, is there anyway you can sort of help size, did \u2013 were you to not make those incremental step-ups that you\u2019ve kind of layered in with this update. What you think the margin profile might\u2019ve looked like otherwise? Jon Ayers : It\u2019s relatively small differences. We haven\u2019t broken that up, but it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re just trying to highlight that we\u2019re advancing some additional investments and that\u2019s factored into the guide. Andrew Cooper : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then my last one would just be sort of higher level and again, along the lines that, I think Erin asked about, in terms of international and sort of how we think about the growth there. You\u2019ve seen really strong same-store growth like you talked about in the U.S. Has that pace in terms of same-store been consistent internationally or faster. Or is there \u2013 not too much, but much more of a focus on kind of the new accounts and not as much on the same-store kind of drivers. So you think there\u2019s lot more opportunity there, but it maybe hasn\u2019t kept up with the U.S. or any color on that would be great. Jon Ayers : Well, what I will say is, and thank you for that question. I think we are driving growth through new instrument placements. We do see a nice \u2013 you don\u2019t get to double-digit recurring revenue growth without both the new customer and store and dynamic and some modest price realization. But, we don\u2019t yet really have an appropriate focus on preventative care outside of North America yet, simply because I think it just test the sick pets, we would be a lot higher utilization than we have today.  So we\u2019re just convincing them to add diagnostics as part of the sick pet visit, which is obviously outside the U.S. with an overall lower standards, a higher proportion of total practice visits. And yet the preventative \u2013 there\u2019s no reason that preventative care couldn\u2019t be an opportunity broadly speaking outside the U.S. we have it, we have started very, very selective markets, but it\u2019s a relatively small thing and something I talked about last quarter, but it is ahead of us. At some point we will turn to preventative care globally, because we have great proprietary platform in that regard. And the sales organization and the diagnostic modalities to pull that off. It\u2019s just not quite ready for the opportunities internationally are where we\u2019re taking advantage of them today with the new instrument placements and utilization growth and sick animal testing. Jon Ayers : We have time for one more question. Operator : And that question is from the line of Michael Ryskin. Please go ahead sir. Michael Ryskin : Question has been answered. Thanks. Jon Ayers : Okay, great. Thank you all. With that, we\u2019ll conclude the call. I want to, again, thank our employees for the phenomenal progress and the performance in Q1 and advancement of our technology and commercial strategies around the world. And also, I\u2019m grateful for the attention the confidence that our investors have in the IDEXX business model. So with that, we\u2019ll conclude the call. Thank you very much for calling in. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

To allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit his or her questions to one with one follow-up as necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we\u2019ll take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Good morning, everyone. IDEXX delivered continued strong financial performance in the second quarter. In terms of highlights, Q2 revenues of $620 million grew 7% on a reported basis or 9% organically. Results were driven by continued strong 11% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, net of a combined 0.5% growth headwind related to Brexit order timing and equivalent day impacts. The quality of our growth was excellent in the quarter, reflected in strong U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains across our major modalities. And 39% growth in new and competitive Catalysts placements in international markets, which supported solid global EVI gains and continue to high growth and consumable revenues. Profit performance continued at a strong pace in Q2 supported by continued high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth and high profit flow through. EPS was $1.43 per share, an increase of 19% on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting a better than projected 120 basis point improvement in constant currency operating margins. In addition to strong operating profit gains, Q2 EPS results also benefited from $0.04 per share, an upside related to share-based compensation tax benefits. While, our CAG Diagnostic recurring organic revenue growth remains strong and on track with our full year 11% to 12% growth goals, our overall Q2 organic growth of 9% was at the lower end of our projected growth range for the quarter, impacted by a few select factors. We fell short of our goals to build on very high prior year international chemistry upgrade levels with the majority of our Q2 upgrade placement shortfall in China. We also saw increased pressure on China LPD revenues in Q2, driven by the African swine fever outbreak, as well as a relatively higher than projected impact from Brexit and equivalent day affects in the quarter. These factors were largely specific to the second quarter. We\u2019ve refined our full your revenue outlook to incorporate these effects, while raising our full year EPS guidance, reflecting continued benefits from high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth and discipline P&L management. In terms of our full year revenue outlook, we\u2019re maintaining our guidance for 11% to 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. We\u2019re refining our overall organic growth guidance to 9.5% to 10.5%, lowering our high-end growth outlook by 0.5%, incorporating our second quarter results. Our updated full year revenue guidance is now $2,380 million to $2,410 million, $10 million below our prior midpoint revenue range reflecting, $5 million in operational refinements and approximately $5 million of impacts related to updated FX estimates. We\u2019re raising our 2019 EPS guidance range by $0.5 per share at midpoint to $4.82 to $4.92, or 17% to 20% growth on a comparable constant currency basis. This outlook reflects $0.02 in EPS benefit at midpoint related to higher expectations for operating performance driven by a raised outlook for 100 to 125 basis points in full year constant currency operating margin improvement and lower projected interest expense. Our guidance builds in $0.04 per share increase from updated projections for share-based compensation tax benefits, incorporating Q2 upsides, offset by $0.01 negative impacts related to updated FX assumptions. We\u2019ll review our updated 2019 outlook later in my comments. Let\u2019s begin with a review of our Q2 performance by segment and region. Q2 results reflected a continued strong performance in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were $547 million, up 10% organically driven by 11% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, including strong global gains across our major modalities. As noted, our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth in the quarter was net of 0.5% headwind from Brexit order timing and equivalent day effects, which were relatively greater than anticipated impacted by the timing of European holidays. Year-to-date CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 11.4% in line with our full year goals. Veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems revenues increased 9% overall and 7% organically in Q2, driven by double-digit organic gains in VSS revenues. We saw continued strong sales results across our practice management platforms and growth in recurring software services on our expanding PIMS and application installed base. Our diagnostic imaging business also continues to achieve high levels of digital radiography instrument placements and growth in recurring services, although our organic revenue gains in the quarter were moderated by comparisons to high prior year instrument placement levels. Our Water business revenues grew 10% organically in the second quarter to $35 million with consistent mid-single digit growth in the U.S., augmented by high growth in Asia and Latin America, aided by our expanded direct sales presence. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue in Q2 was $33 million, reflecting relatively flat organic growth. Strong organic growth and health herd screening revenues aided by a favorable prior year comparison in the quarter and solid gains in poultry and pregnancy testing were offset by greater than projected pressure on swine diagnostic testing revenues related to impacts from African swine fever \u2013 the African swine fever epidemic in China, as well as moderate declines in European disease eradication program revenues. By region, U.S. revenues are $389 million in the quarter, up 9% organically, driven by an 11% organic increase in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. U.S. recurring revenue gains were supported by double-digit growth in U.S. Reference Labs and consumables and high-single digit gains in rapid assay sales. U.S. CAG recurring diagnostic growth continues to be primarily volume driven with net price gains continuing to trend in the 2% to 3% range across our major modalities. IDEXX growth continues to outpace broader market trends. In Q2, total visits per practice growth was 0.7% year-on-year, with clinical visits per practice growing at a greater amount at 2.1%, and overall revenue per practice increasing 4.4%. Market growth results were slightly moderated from Q1 levels, which were refined following our latest dataset refresh. Note that these metrics are on the same-store basis and don\u2019t include growth benefits from incremental practice formation which we estimated approximately 1% annually. International revenues in Q2 were $230 million, up 9% organically, driven by 11% organic gains and CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. As noted last quarter, we saw benefits in Q1 related to advanced ordering ahead of the previous Brexit deadline. These effects reversed in the second quarter, which along with an unfavorable impact related to the timing of European holidays, reduce overall international CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains by approximately 1.5% and consumable gains by [indiscernible] Adjusting for this dynamic, international consumer gains were nearly 20% in Q2, supported by our commercial executional focus and expanding our global Catalyst installed base. International CAG Diagnostic revenue gains were moderated by consistent mid-single digit revenue gains in our Reference Lab business. This is an area targeted for improvement in the second half of 2019, aided by relatively more favorable year-on-year comparisons and benefits from our expanding veterinary diagnostic consultant business model. In terms of segment performance, our Q2 results reflected strong global gains across CAG Diagnostic testing modalities and continued progress and expanding our premium installed equipment based globally. Globally EVI was up solidly in Q2 compared to very strong prior year levels, driven by growth in high quality Catalyst placements. In North America, we placed 319 Catalysts at new and competitive accounts, as well as 159 second Catalysts at larger IDEXX accounts. Second Catalyst placements are supporting continued strong consumable growth and high customer retention rates, aided by steadily expanding 360 degree program and other long-term contract commitments. These results compare to strong prior year, new and competitive Catalysts placement levels of 346 units and 95 second Catalysts placements. Along with limited VetTest upgrades, total North American Catalyst placements were 486 in the quarter, up 8% supporting a 15% year-on-year growth in our North American installed base, including approximately 5% of growth benefit from upgrades completed in the second half of 2018 at Banfield. In international markets, we placed 761 Catalyst at new and competitive accounts, or 66% of total placements, up 213 units or 39% compared to the prior year. Total international Catalysts placements of 1,149 units were down 4% compared to a very strong prior year levels, which had high levels of VetTest upgrades in Asia-Pacific markets. As noted, while our new and competitive Catalyst results were excellent, we did fall short of our goals in Q2 to build on our high priority levels of upgrades in expansion markets such as China, which contributed to a shortfall to our quarterly instrument revenue goals. Despite these dynamics, our international Catalyst installed base reached nearly 21,000 units in Q2, up 28% year-on-year and over 5% compared to ending Q1 levels. Overall, we placed 3,171 premium analyzers in Q2, down 2% year-on-year. Total Catalyst placements were 1,635, down 1% reflecting the tough compared to high prior year VetTest upgrade levels. We achieved 602 SediVue placements in Q2, down 16% compared to very strong prior year levels, which benefited from a high percentage of our early 360 degree program agreements, including seven new compared to a more recent mix shift, which has included relatively more Catalyst as part of our 360 program commitments. We placed 934 premium hematology instruments globally in the quarter, up 7% with a continued high attach rate with new and competitive Catalysts placements. In addition to these strong premium instrument results, we placed a record 2,663 SNAP Pros in Q2, expanding our SNAP Pro installed base to over 30,000, with over 27,000 installed in North America, helping to support increasing retention rates in our rapid assay business. CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues in Q2 were $32 million, a decrease of 7% organically off a strong compare in 2018, which included mixed benefits from very strong placements of higher priced SediVue instruments. Benefits from a growing instrument base, test and software innovation and expanded direct commercial capability continue to drive strong recurring CAG Diagnostic revenue gains across our major modalities. Instrument consumable revenues of $175 million, grew 13% organically in Q2, net of 1% growth headwind related to Brexit order timing and equivalent day impacts. Results reflect double-digit gains in the U.S. and normalized growth nearly 20% in international markets. High volume-driven consumable gains were supported by continued expansion of SediVue and SDMA in a slide with each contributing nearly 1% to year-on-year consumable revenue gains in the quarter. Reference Laboratory and consulting services revenues of $214 million, grew 10% organically into Q2. U.S. lab momentum continues to be very strong reflected in low- to mid-teen volume driven organic Reference Lab revenue gains and sustained high customer retention levels. Overall lab growth was moderated by consistent mid-single digit organic lab growth in international markets. Rapid assay revenues of $69 million, grew 9% organically in Q2, reflecting continued expansion of 4Dx Plus specialty and first generation products supported by planned promotional programs and high customer retention levels, aided by our expanded SNAP Pro installed base. Rapid assay gains continued to be primarily volume driven, augmented by moderate net price gains. Turning to the P&L, operating profit in Q2 was $164 million, up 13% as reported or 14% on a constant currency basis, supported by operating margin gains across our CAG order and LPD segments. Operating margins were 26.5%, up 120 basis points on a constant currency basis or 140 basis points as reported reflecting moderate gross margin gains and stronger than projected operating expense leverage. Gross profit was $358 million in Q2, up 8% as reported or 9% on a constant currency basis. Gross margin was $57.7%, increased 30 basis points on a constant currency basis, supported by product margin gains, reflecting benefits from moderate net price increases and strong consumable and rapid assayed growth. These gains and scale and productivity benefits in our U.S. lab business were offset by plan investments in lab capacity and systems, as well as incremental year-on-year costs associated with expanded software field service resources Foreign exchange hedge gains, which are reflected in gross profit, were approximately $2.5 million in Q2. Operating expenses in Q2 were up 4% or 6% on a constant currency basis resulting in 90 basis points of positive operating margin leverage. Constant currency operating expense increases were driven by growth in R&D spending and increased costs related to our expanded global commercial infrastructure with some favorability related \u2013 relative to our expectations for the quarter relative to the ramping of cost growth in these areas. Overall operating expense growth was moderated in Q2 by relatively limited constant currency growth in G&A costs reflecting low year-on-year corporate function and benefit costs growth and LPD cost controls. EPS in Q2 was a $1.43 per share, an increase of 16% as reported and 19% on a comparable constant currency basis. Foreign exchange, net of hedge impacts in Q2 2018 and 2019 decreased operating profit by [indiscernible] million and EPS by $0.01 per share. Our effective tax rate was 19.5% in Q2, including benefits of approximately 3% to our tax rate or $0.05 per share related to share-based compensation activity, which is approximately $0.04 per share, higher than projected. Free cash flow was $99 million for the first half of 2019. We continue to expect free cash flow at 60% to 65% of net income for 2019, reflecting a consistent full year outlook for capital spending of $160 million to $175 million. This includes approximately $70 million of combined incremental capital spending related to our Westbrook Maine headquarters expansion in our German core lab relocation or about 20% of net income. We allocated $20 million in capital to repurchase 86,000 shares and Q2. Year-to-date, we repurchased 353,000 shares or $74 million or an average price of $210 per share. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended Q2 to with $956 million in debt, $111 million in cash, and $597 million in capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 1.49 times gross, and 1.31 times net of cash and investment balances. We\u2019re refining our 2019 full year outlook for a reduction in average shares outstanding from stock repurchases of approximately 1%, which reflects more recent stock price trends and assumes that we maintain net leverage ratios at current levels. We now project annual interest expense of approximately $34 million, an improvement of $2 million more than offsetting these impacts. In terms of our updated P&L outlook for 2019, our full year reported revenue guidance is now $2,380 million to $2,410 million, reflecting refined expectations for 9.5% to 10.5% overall organic growth and consistent 11% to 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Our reported revenue outlook reflects a projected 1.5% to 2% full year FX revenue growth headwind at the rates assumed in our press release. As noted, we\u2019re raising our 2019 full year EPS guidance $0.05 per share at mid point to $4.82 to $4.92 reflecting an outlook for 17% to 20% comparable constant currency EPS growth. Refinements to our revenue outlook or more than offset by increased expectations for full year operating margin improvement, now projected at 100 basis points to 125 basis points, generating $0.02 of operational benefits including net upsize from revised projections for full year interest expense in share account reduction. Our EPS guidance assumes at 2019 effective tax rate of 19.5% to 20%, a 50 basis point improvement compared to earlier guidance lending $0.04 of reported EPS upside. This tax rate includes an estimate of $12 million to $14 million or approximately 2.5% and projected a full year tax rate benefit from exercise of share-based compensation. At midpoint of our guidance estimates \u2013 this equates to about $0.15 per share in full year benefit. We now estimate the foreign exchange rate changes will decrease EPS, reported EPS by $0.04 per share, $0.01 greater than \u2013 a $0.01 greater impact in our last outlook head of approximately $11.5 million in projected hedge gains. For the third quarter outlook, we expect reported revenue growth of 9% to 10.5% and organic revenue gains of 10.5% to 12% including 1% to 1.5% equivalent day growth benefit. We expect Q3 2019 operating margins to increase 50 basis points to 100 basis points above prior year Q3 levels on a constant currency basis, and we expect our effective tax rate in Q3 to be approximately 21% including projected benefits from share-based compensation exercise activity. That concludes the financial review, our business momentum remains strong and we\u2019re on track to deliver our 2019 financial performance aligned with our long term goals. Let me now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Jay Mazelsky : Good morning and thank you, Brian. IDEXX second quarter results build on our strong start to 2019, and reflect the strength of our recurring revenue business model, keeping us on track towards excellent full year results aligned with our long term goals. Our performance was led by solid 11% organic growth in our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, or 11.5% normalized for Q1 Brexit pooling and equivalent day impacts. This expanding highly durable annuity contributed 77% of IDEXXs total revenues in Q2. Let me start with a few reflections on the quarter. We were especially pleased with the strength of our U.S. performance in Q2, where we drove 11% recurring CAG growth, reflecting strong gains across all CAG recurring diagnostic modalities. We saw continued momentum in our U.S. reference lab business, whereas previously communicated, we continued to invest in operational enhancements such as new courier routes, new day labs, and weekend service. These investments provide service level and results, turnaround improvements, both of which support customer retention and new customer acquisition. In our North American VetLab business, Catalysts placements were up 8% including second Catalysts placed at high testing volume accounts, which also support customer retention and help drive continued double-digit consumable gains. Of note, the rapid assay business grew at 9% organically benefiting from superior clinical accuracy, effective promotional programs and improving customer retention. The business was also aided by our expanding SNAP Pro installed base, an increasing leverage of IDEXX multimodality testing capability. Reinforcing our long held premise the test that indicates testing; we\u2019re seeing strong evidence of faster rapid assay 4Dx Plus growth, and IDEXX practices that also use our lab services and are adopting Preventive Care protocols. Globally instrument placements were solid during the quarter, considering tough compares at overall quality, with notable strength in international competitive Catalysts placements, which were up 39%. Our premium installed base continues to expand nicely, and we don\u2019t see a change in the competitive environment. These placement gains along with ongoing increases in testing utilization drove continued strong growth in international consumables. International consumable sales were up nearly 20% normalized for the impact of Brexit order timing and equivalent days aligned with our strategy to develop this significant in-clinic opportunity in international markets. Continued solid momentum across our business is keeping us on track for 11% to 12% CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue gains this year, and comparable constant currency EPS gains at the high end of our long-term goals. Let me share some additional highlights related to progress on key fronts in our growth strategy. We continue to make solid progress advancing IDEXX Preventive Care. Our high same-store sales growth at the practice level in our U.S. Labs business is being driven in part by the adoption of Preventive Care diagnostics, what we call IDEXX Preventive Care. To date through Q2, over 3,100 practices have enrolled in the Preventive Care program since its inception. With 370 new practices enrolled in the quarter, a quarterly high for first time enrollees. IDEXX Preventive Care practices are growing CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue at approximately 14% on a trailing 12-month basis versus 11% growth for IDEXX U.S. customer base over the same period Virtually our entire VDC population in the U.S is now successfully partnered with customers in their territories to deliver IDEXX Preventive Care. In fact, the top 50% of our VDC population as ranked by their engagement in Preventive Care exceeded their first half territory revenue goals by approximately 200 basis points. It\u2019s a great example of how we create market growth. We always start with the customer and patient need to understand where appropriately applying IDEXX Diagnostics, like fecal antigen and IDEXX SDMA can uncover four underlying disease. In the case of preventative care, we bring the relevant test together to create Preventive Care protocols. That closely aligned with how customers consume diagnostics testing along with compliance driven pricing that support the practice of best medicine. We leverage big data to raise awareness in practice centers, showing the medical benefits of applying appropriate diagnostics testing for Preventive Care to all pets, not just the older dogs and cats. Our field organization also plays an important role in customer success and market growth. Representing a key reason, we went to a high frequency trusted advisor model. We\u2019re able to invest time and resources to help customers achieve their patient and business goals. In early Q3, we introduced our IDEXX anywhere urine analysis bundle, available exclusively to IDEXX Preventive Care customers. This offering combines the convenience and pricing of Preventive Care diagnostics run at the reference lab, with all the clinical advantages of fresh year running in-house on the city view. This innovation is enabled by our unique integration capabilities between the IDEXX VetLab station, practice management software, and the IDEXX reference lab providing to customers, a seamless ordering and billing experience across modalities. We believe this multimodality customer friendly solution could help further accelerate our Preventive Care momentum. It helps support said of you placements and associated utilization. We continue to have exceptional performance with our SNAP Pro placements of over 2,300 placed in the second quarter in the U.S. alone, up 100% year-over-year. We continue to methodically transform our rapid assay customer base into a razor and blade business model. As the SNAP Pro mobile instrument brings significant workflow and charge capture value to the veterinary practice. We see higher growth and rapid assay loyalty with customers adopt this SNAP Pro active and connected workflow. With the placements in Q2, we are now just a bit south of 65% of our SNAP 4Dx plus revenue, coming from these active and connected SNAP Pro customers. I\u2019d also like to provide an update on the status of our international sales force expansion. Our international business performance is strong. As evidenced by the continued high growth and economic value of instrument placements and International CAG recurring growth at 12.5% in Q2, adjusted for approximately 1.5% combined headwind for Brexit order timing and equivalent day impacts. We\u2019ve now completed the second full quarter within the expanded model and the commercial teams are responding well. Having had responsibility for three such initiatives in the U.S., there\u2019s a time and distant element to building out the expansion. As we onboard new sales professionals develop their expertise in diagnostics and our product offering and grow their customer relationships. We track key metrics on our progress like tenure, which jump nicely in Q2. Since experience correlates well with effectiveness. We expect to see further business benefits of these efforts in the second half consistent with our experience in U. S. Where we feel effectiveness increased every quarter with tenure and deeper customer relationships Moving to the veterinary software portfolio, Q2 was another very strong quarter for global placements, Cornerstone, Neo and Animana systems. In North America, practice management software placements grew 44% year-over-year for the quarter. Neo recently launched in Canada in Australia, complimenting Cornerstone in both of those markets. Speaking at Cornerstone, we continue to see an unprecedented pace of Cornerstone upgrades to version 9.1 driven by customer excitement for the modernized user interface and disease. We have upgraded close to 2,000 Cornerstone users in less than four months. A record and testament to customer enthusiasm and a place to share that we achieved a critical technical milestone in the development of Cornerstone cloud, currently in field testing, which we\u2019ll make available in the future and will bring the many benefits of the cloud to customers that value Cornerstone, as the go to high end practice management system. Q2 was also a strong quarter for Web PACS, one of our nine cloud-based softwares and service offerings, which experienced that 34% year-over-year increase in enrollments. Other software offerings from IDEXX are advancing nicely, including the development of an enterprise management and analytics platform for corporate customers. In summary, we feel very good about our business progress across the range of strategic fronts, and believe we are well positioned to sustain strong recurring CAG Diagnostics revenue growth and EPS gains aligned with our goals. We look forward to sharing more about the enduring growth potential we see for our business in our long-term strategy to capture this potential at the upcoming Investor day later this month. Before I conclude, I wanted to extend our best wishes to Jon Ayers, as he works through his rehabilitation process. The strong results, we continued to deliver reflected deep and talented team that Jon has developed at IDEXX. And I know he has great confidence in IDEXX to keep delivering against our purpose in potential. And with that, we\u2019ll open it up to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go to line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Ryskin : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the call. I want to start on the Reference Lab. The overall numbers, I mean, that was one area that came in a little bit lighter relative to expectations. And you talked a little bit about the U.S. performance and how well that held in, but international it seems like continues to lag just a little bit. I wonder if there\u2019s anything going on there. I mean, we\u2019ve talked in the past about the EVI and the focus on the point of care offering, but I want to see if the dynamic changed at all. And I wonder if there was any impact of the heat wave in Europe like we\u2019ve seen in the past or anything like that? Brian McKeon : Yes, Mike. Why don\u2019t I just kind of clarify the numbers? But the Reference Labs trends in Q2 were very consistent with what we saw in Q1. I think here we have some normalization going on, but the U.S. was \u2013 the Q1 was 14%. It was like 13% normalized in Q2, and we had mid-single, very consistent mid-single digit gains in international. So we didn\u2019t have a change in trend and Jay can talk more about this, but as you know, we\u2019ve been sort of signaling target improvement as we work through the year on the international labs and we will have some more favorable comparison, but Jay can expand on that. Jay Mazelsky : Yes, just some additional context heading. Our overall business performance internationally was quite strong. We saw the 12.5% normalized CAG recurring growth performance. And as Brian indicated in his remarks, really strong competitive and placements associated economic value with the international consumables growth at nearly 20% normalized. So overall, very good performance. As I indicated, we\u2019re still in the process of building out the VDC expansion and I think time is as our VDC has continued to build relationships with their customers in the market and we know with time comes additional effectiveness. Keep in mind that we start with very strong country organizations. A lot of our sales professionals and country managers in international have been with the company, and know diagnostics for a decade or two decades. So that\u2019s the base where we are building off of. In additional, they are representing phenomenal product line across the broad-based diagnostics offering. So we\u2019re feeling good and about where we are and expect to continue to build off that capability in the second half. Brian McKeon : And just to reinforce something Mike on performance versus expectations, we felt very good about the recurring CAG growth in the quarter. If you\u2019d normalize the effects we highlighted, it was 11.5%. That\u2019s where we are year-to-date, that\u2019s right in range with what we are trying to achieve, fee for the full year. So relative to what we were targeting, this was an area that was right on line with what we\u2019re hoping to achieve. Michael Ryskin : All right. That\u2019s helpful. And a quick follow-up if I could. I\u2019ve gotten a flurry of your questions, since you brought up the comments on China. That was a little bit surprising. Could you just walk us through what happened there? What do you saw in the quarter? What your expectations are for the rest of the year? Brian McKeon : Yes, we had a couple of effects that were related to China. Let me break them down and maybe LPD is the easier one to start with. But we\u2019ve been working through the Africans swine fever impact. As you know China is not a big part of our overall company revenues. It\u2019s 2.6% last year, roughly evenly split between LPD and CAG and \u2013 but within the LPD business, the swine testing business in China is a meaningful part of our LPD revenues, and we saw an acceleration in decline on the African swine fever from the Q1 levels. It\u2019s a business it\u2019s a little tougher to predict. We can \u2013 we sell into larger laboratories and so it\u2019s a little less visibility than some of other assets of our business, but that was a couple of $1 million below what we were expecting to achieve in the quarter, and we feel like we\u2019ve got that reason to calibrate it. We\u2019ve got some other initiatives we are advancing to mitigate that and we\u2019ve got some promising trends in other parts of the business, health herd screening that we feel good about. So I think the \u2013 net-net we think we\u2019ve got that factored in but that was a surprise in Q2. On the instrument placements, we had excellent competitive instrument placements in China. The challenge that we had was, we had very strong prior year VetTest upgrades as well and I think in retrospect, we probably had overly aggressive goals going into this year to both to make progress on the competitive \u2013 new competitive front and to build on the strong upgrades. So it\u2019s always been a competitive market, wouldn\u2019t necessarily relate to softness in the market per se, I think, with some more as I mentioned, retrospect that we probably had aggressive goals here. But I think that\u2019s another point of context. So China is smaller for us overall, but I think in the quarter, had some impacts, but we feel we\u2019ve got that calibrated in the updated outlook. Michael Ryskin : That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan Daniels : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. And I\u2019ll also start by wishing Jon the best in his rehabilitation. Jay, maybe one for you, you talked about the record enrollment of, I think 370 practices in the IDEXX Preventive Care program. Can you speak a little bit towards what\u2019s driving that? It seems a little bit unique, I think, we typically see kind of a rapid growth in early adopters and then slowly in the vet space. So what\u2019s driving such strong momentum there for your business? Jay Mazelsky : Sure. Thank you, Ryan, for the question. We think it really starts with a fact that there is a very sizable market opportunity and I\u2019m going to refer my comments specifically to North America in the U.S. We think that the U.S. Preventive Care market, addressable market is about $3 billion, we saw about $1 billion and that have served in \u2013 and we have about a third of that. So we\u2019re still in the \u2013 in our early stages of being able to develop this marketplace. And then you look at just sort of benchmark and provide some background context on the opportunity, a fairly small percentage of Companion Animals are getting tested today. We have cited statistics and data in the past that about 15% of dogs come in to a practice for clinical visits undergo a chemistry test, only 15%. On the vector-borne disease side, a little over third. So 36% canines in any given year get some sort of vector-borne disease screened. This could be something as basic as heartworm, only 15% are getting the full vector-borne disease screened before the act. So that stats with a very sizable opportunity. And then from a programmatic standpoint, the IDEXX Preventive Care program, I think really hits a sweet spot in the marketplace we have a care protocols designed specifically for Preventive Care or wellness screening, it\u2019s priced to really drive compliance with the client. We are able to provide tools and training for the practices and repeat follow-ups. So from the standpoint of operationalize, they\u2019re implementing a concept that our customers are quite interested in to begin with, but have struggled in the past to be able to get good traction with this, we think we have really hit the sweet spot and our field is trained and excited by it and consequently driving growth with it. Ryan Daniels : Okay, super helpful color. And then just as a follow-up on a different topic, the operating margin performance continues to display upward pressure despite investments you\u2019re making. Can you maybe highlight what some of the key deltas are between prior expectations versus kind of the expectations you had going into the year? What are really the major upside drivers there? Thanks. Brian McKeon : Yes, I think a couple of factors. I think we always benefit from good execution on growing the CAG recurring diagnostic revenue. So I think there the incremental flow through from that growth is high gross margin for us and I think that always if we\u2019re executing well, which we have been, supports good P&L profile. We\u2019ve had, as I mentioned in my comments, somewhat slower than anticipated ramp in some of the growth we\u2019re projecting for R&D and sales and marketing, nothing to be concerned about, it\u2019s more just in a world where there is a lot of competition for talent, where we don\u2019t have all the position filled with the way that we had originally projected and we\u2019re confident we can get on that track, but we had some upside related to that. And we have had good G&A management. We\u2019ve been disciplined in the corporate functions, we had better than expected benefit cost, which is something that we have \u2013 our HR team does a tremendous job of managing that area. And I think we\u2019re seeing good results as a company from that. That\u2019s been favorable. And so those are some of the drivers, I think it\u2019s broadly Ryan, more just reflective of the health of our business model, when we\u2019re growing, the recurring CAG revenues as well that has good favorability for us. Ryan Daniels : Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. And I do wish Jon all the best in his recovery as well. We\u2019re all thinking about him here. And thanks for taking my questions as well. I guess a follow-up to the last question there kind of on the profit experience that obviously, was pretty strong and were there any some timing dynamics, where you\u2019re seeing that some of the costs were potentially pushed out to the outer quarters or how should we be contemplating that quarterly cadence in terms of the profit dynamic for the balance of the year? Brian McKeon : Somewhat, you know, more modest, I would say, in terms of pushing out timing. I think it\u2019s more of the ramp of the cost, Erin, so we\u2019re a little favorable in Q2 and we\u2019re anticipating we\u2019ll be back on track in the back half of the year and that\u2019s reflected. We shared a 50 to 100 basis points constant currency improvement in Q3 so that reflects that we\u2019re seeing the cost growth particularly in R&D and in the international sales and marketing, getting ramping as we work through the year. So it \u2013 we had \u2013 that I would say is the bigger driver was and we have some specific benefits just in terms of things that we\u2019ve been managing effectively in the quarter, but we feel comfortable with effectively we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve an outlook for the second half that\u2019s more 50 to 100 basis points which is in line with our longer-term trends and goals. Erin Wright : Okay, great. Thanks. And then on the Preventive Care side, what could add instead of your urine analysis to the program add for you? Is this significant in terms of financial contributions or placement trends or how much of your existing kind of Preventative Care users are actually already incorporating urine analysis in their program? I\u2019m just curious what could this could add? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. So we \u2013 thank you, Erin, for the question. We think over time that it will help support our Preventive Care momentum. Over \u2013 there\u2019s a majority of customers who already use urine as part of the testing panel for Preventive Care, and one of their requests from customers as they wanted to pressure because it\u2019s more clinically relevant. So being able to provide at a multimodality screen for customers was extremely well received in the marketplace, we\u2019re enthusiastic about it and we think it also, by the way, help with SediVue placements over time. Erin Wright : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open. Jon Block : Great, thanks, guys. Good morning. Maybe two questions on some similar themes that were already touched upon, but just to go to Preventative Care, I think, Jay, you might\u2019ve mentioned roughly a 300 basis point premium growth rate from those called PCC adopters versus the non-adopters. And maybe if you can elaborate on that a little bit. Do you think we see that delta widen further over time? And maybe if you were to isolate the practices that did adopt PCC, where were they previously? In other words, were they 7% or 8% and jumped to 14% or 15%? Any more granularity would be helpful. Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. So, just in terms of that, that 300 basis point orbit, we think that those customers are using more diagnostics that they have got from largely testing geriatric patients that testing adults and senior patients and incorporating diagnostics in their panels. I think what the data shows is that they had perhaps assumed that if a dog or cat was well and was an adult, that they didn\u2019t do diagnostic testing, they didn\u2019t need to do it. And what the data is showing is that they\u2019re very significant, we\u2019re able to uncover very significant number of abnormalities that require follow-up in doing testing. So we think that it\u2019s just a classic case of being able to demonstrate that the clinical benefit of doing testing more broadly across the population patients. In terms of how that plays out differentially, in terms of growth over time, we\u2019ll say, we expect to continue to see benefits, but that\u2019s a function of\u2026 Brian McKeon : And Jon, we\u2019ll share more of that at Investor Day, that\u2019s obviously part of the long-term strategy and we\u2019ll share how we\u2019re thinking about that. Jon Block : Okay, great. And then sort of a quick follow-up, two small ones. First on new products, you got that Analyst Day coming up, right. As you just mentioned, I hope you\u2019ve got a lot of to discuss. But is the belief that new product introductions are more, call it an industry conference event rather than a Wall Street event and the other small one would just be on the $5 million in organic revs coming down, it certainly seemed like it did not occur in CAG recurring. So if we were to isolate it, Brian, is this sort of 50-50 between, call it LPD and the instrument side? Thanks, guys. Brian McKeon : Two questions, just on the first one, Analyst Day is we intend to have discussions in new products when we\u2019re ready to bring them to market. So I think we\u2019re \u2013 you should anticipate, we\u2019ll have those discussions close to when we\u2019re ready to bring products to market and we\u2019re not going to be trying to time it around investor events if you will. No offense, but I think we want to have this lined up as best we can in terms of executing with their business. And in terms of the dynamics versus \u2013 deltas versus our expectation in the quarter, Jon. It was \u2013 that was pretty much it. It was three things; it was \u2013 the international upgrades where we \u2013 we had great competitive placements, but we were probably a little aggressive on trying to do that and build on the upgrades. It was LPD, China, specifically African swine fever effects. And to a degree we\u2019ve underestimated the days impacts in Europe somewhat. We didn\u2019t flag that 0.5% impact heading into the quarter and we knew there were some impact, but that turned out to be just where the days fell a little bit more significant than we anticipated. But some total that was about $5 million, $6 million delta to where we thought we\u2019d come in and we\u2019re basically just flowing that through. We think it\u2019s a largely second quarter. We\u2019ve calibrated effectively and feel very good about the year. And as you pointed out, the recurring CAG right on track and healthy year-to-date trends right in line with what we hope to achieve for the full year. Jon Block : Perfect. Thanks for your time, guys. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open. Mark Massaro : Hey, guys, thank you. And I also want to send my best regards to Jon in his recovery. I guess my first question is just on the, how you guys are thinking about \u2013 I know you\u2019re not ready to guide for 2020, but you\u2019ve posted some really strong growth in premium instruments as you\u2019ve talked about in recent quarters. And you\u2019re going up against difficult compare, as we think about our models for next year. Recognizing that instruments are only 6% of your revenue, how do you think about growth rates in instruments going forward given difficult comparison? Brian McKeon : We intend to continue to build on our rate of placements. I think that the more important metrics to kind of focus on, are broader than just placement growth we\u2019re obviously, as we\u2019re growing our placements, expanding our installed base that supported by improving retention. So we pointed out in this quarter, the 15% year-on-year growth in the North American Catalyst installed base, about 5 points to that is the Banfield expansion and 28% international. So we\u2019re -- now this is a business where we\u2019re adding more instruments and doing a better job retaining our customers that installed base continues to grow, it\u2019s the flywheel effect. And that forms the foundation for additional drivers of growth, right? In terms of expanding the adoption of our innovations on this platform \u2013 on our platforms, adding new innovations as we have done in recent years as well, and that\u2019s all supported by the in-house commercial capabilities that we have the VDC model. And that outflows into the strong double-digit recurring CAG growth delivering and we intend to deliver in the future. So it\u2019s one metric, as you point out, we\u2019re building on bigger numbers we want to keep going on that, but there is a broader model here in terms of driving increased utilization and innovation on these platforms that grow and capability over time that support the double-digit growth. Jay Mazelsky : Yes, just to add some color to Brian\u2019s remarks. A key element of our strategy, Mark, is to be able to continue to drive menu expansion which in turn supports the CAG Diagnostics revenue growth. So if you take look at Catalyst for example, we have a technology for life type of philosophy, seven new assays as part of the menu in seven years, latest being Progesterone, it\u2019s a great example of bringing Real-Time Care measurement to the clinic. As you know the pregnancy, the contamination of it, there is tight window on the veterinarian wants to be able to advise the breeder in terms of the optimal time, it -- if you are able to do that in a real-time basis with Catalyst in the clinic that drives serial testing. In the case of SediVue, another great example, with SediVue the neuro network 4.0 which we released earlier in the year based on 175 million images, more geared towards the 4.0 release of liver function, bilirubin and ammonium biurate. So we\u2019ve got excellent customer feedback on that, and we continue to drive do manual expansion more testing utilization. So that\u2019s a key element for our strategy. Mark Massaro : Excellent. And I also wanted just ask about the end market. Trends look strong to us. You reported clinical visits grew 2.1% this quarter. Do you expect clinical visits to hover in that call it 2% growth rate? And then I also wanted to ask about how you\u2019re thinking about competitive dynamics for the next year given Zoetis expecting to complete their integration of Abaxis on their SAP? Brian McKeon : Yes. So from a market performance standpoint, top line practice revenue growth was 4.4%. That the clinical piece that you indicated was 2.1%, we think the relevant piece, at least, for our business because that\u2019s where the diagnostic testing occurs as part of those visits. And we\u2019re in pretty much in line with what we have seen in the past is a little bit of variability quarter-to-quarter. But we think it was a strong quarter, it supports the CAG Diagnostics recurring growth profile that we achieved in the quarter and that we have indicated from an outlook standpoint, we expect going forward. And I also think that when you take a look at some of our market development activities like Preventive Care, that will continue to drive the market. Part of what we do is we create markets, we manufacture our own growth. In terms of the your second question on competitive dynamics, we haven\u2019t up to now seen a change, more broadly speaking in the competitive landscape, we\u2019re always looking and anticipating that, but our focus is really on our customers and servicing our customers with solutions that address both the clinical and business needs. Mark Massaro : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Westerberg with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. David Westerberg : Thank you for taking the question and best to Jon as well. So can you give us an update qualitatively or quantitatively on SDMA slide? Is it running above, below or at expectation in terms of contributing to growth, and how do you see this as a kind of a multiyear growth driver? Jay Mazelsky : Yes, thank you, David for the question. We are very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made on Catalyst SDMA and in fact, close to 60% of customers in the second quarter actually used SDMA on Catalyst, that\u2019s a global number since its introduction are close to 70% of customers have actually purchased SDMA for Catalyst. Another benchmark connected with that is, we\u2019ve now run over 2 million SDMA tests on Catalyst since its introduction. Now that\u2019s on top of 22 million tests plus, 22 million plus test that we run the global reference lab since introducing that test on the reference lab. So we think from a customer perspective, customers have really accepted SDMA as an essential element of the chemistry panel. They see significant clinical value, not just for sick patient visits, but also well visit testing. One study I will share more of this at Investor Day is looking at well patient testing when we move from just a basic Preventive Care straight. So chemistry, CBC, the one that includes SDMA, we see a 40% increase in profiles that indicate the need for further action. So we\u2019re really clinically powerful. I think our customers appreciate that and we are seeing the type of uptick in the metrics I shared with you that support it. David Westerberg : Got it. All right. Thank you. And then \u2013 just maybe to around consolidators and corporate clients, can you just talk about changes and demand around software, middleware or Web links Smart Flow? Are these good conversation starters? Are these revenue drivers? Are they maybe cross-selling opportunities? Can you just walk us through the more the software part element of the corporate customer base? Jay Mazelsky : Sure. I\u2019d be glad to do. So just as a background, keep in mind that the whole notion of corporate and consolidation, it\u2019s not a new dynamic in the marketplace. IDEXX has had quite a successful track record in partnering and growing with corporate accounts over time. But when you talk to the corporate account CEOs, they generally identify commonly, three top issues. One is staff engagement and retention, the second one that you pointed out is really this notion of enterprise scale in IT and software, the third, they want to continue to drive or improve profitable growth in their corporate practices. And we address all three as a company. First with diagnostics, because diagnostics is connected to the Information Management piece, and they I think recognize our diagnostic as a profit center, it drives the care envelope, it\u2019s an important part of their practices that is in subject of some of the same headwinds that they may see in product sales whether it\u2019s food or therapies. And there\u2019s a lot of evidence that when we provide these types of solutions to them, their staff will desire to practice best medicine remain more highly engaged. From an Information Management standpoint, now getting specifically, to the core of your question, our customers, are corporate customers place a very high premium on integration in helping them out with workflow and workflow optimization. And the type of solutions that support that are Cornerstone or PIMS solutions, Smart Flow, Netconnect+, enterprise management and analytics packages that we come up with. The Smart Flow is a great example, where they have a really resonating with an application that works with our PIMS and other third-party PIMS that provides embedded connectivity that helps them with workflow, optimization and communication in the staff. It automatically captures, charges, if they desire to go paperless or paperless light, it has electronic forms. So these are the type of things that they are looking for, and highly responsive to. David Westerberg : Great. Thank you. Operator : Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Andrew Cooper with Raymond James. Your line is open. Andrew Cooper : Thanks for the question. Lots already been asked. So I will keep it quick. Just as we think about kind of IDEXX 360, and more conversations about leveraging the multimodality approach. How has that evolved relative to kind of layering in your end, like you mentioned and some of the numbers competitively? Has there been any change there and how do you continue to drive that as a really competitive advantage for IDEXX relative to what others in the space can\u2019t replicate? Jay Mazelsky : Yes, so, we obviously, have differentiation because we have multimodality solutions and have the ability, like we\u2019ve have just shown with the IDEXX anywhere urine analysis bundle to be able to provide, the best clinically from a solution standpoint, wherever it makes sense to be tested. So I think it\u2019s largely supportive of helping the practice the way they want to. Brian McCann : And Andrew, I\u2019d point we\u2019ve seen steadily increasing rates of growth in cross CAG agreements with our customers. And that\u2019s been a trend that\u2019s been ongoing, but really has accelerated with concepts like 360 and the advancements that we continue to make and just bringing together broader capability to our Information Management innovation and so, to your point it\u2019s an area that\u2019s a building momentum and you see that in the strong growth in EVI and in as well as increasing retention rates across modalities. So it\u2019s definitely been core to IDEXX strategy for a long time and we\u2019re executing very well against programs like 360, just help to reinforce that. Andrew Cooper : Great. And then just one more quick one, I think following up on a question I think Jon asked, but when we think about Preventive Care and the uptake in growth relative to the base, can you help us think about the ramp of how fast from an account says, all right we want to layer it in with the pricing you suggested et cetera, et cetera to seeing that outcome. What the sort of the ramp looks like? And how if there\u2019s any kind of color we should be thinking about or you think about the tail to that as we get out further from the first year to the second year? I know it\u2019s still early but any color there would be great. Jay Mazelsky : I mean just keep in mind from a background standpoint that it takes time. It\u2019s a change management event in the practice. It\u2019s not just the veterinarians but the veterinarian tax receptionist, all practice has to change focus from into a new testing category or approach. So it takes time. We\u2019ll share some insights at Investor Day in terms of what that looks like but there\u2019s no one rule that fits all. Brian McKeon : We\u2019ve made very good progress and it\u2019s supporting a high reference lab growth and we\u2019re seeing benefits across the business. So it\u2019s something that I will that will build over time and like many other things that we have in our business, there\u2019s a very long runway for development, which bodes well for sustaining high growth for the long run. Jay Mazelsky : We have time for one more question. Operator : That will be a follow-up from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Ryskin : Hi, thanks for squeezing me for the follow-up. I just want to confirm something from the prepared remarks, I thought I heard you say that the third quarter organic guide was 10.5% to 12% for the total company. I recognize you\u2019ve got the extra selling day and that should be a sizeable at 100 to 250 bps tailwind but that still, just trying to look at the comps from prior years. You still have a much tougher comp 3Q versus 4Q. So I was wondering if there was anything other than going on in pacing between third quarter and fourth quarter as you go through the year? And have also how you think about some of the you call it out the guide for the second quarter, all U.S. instrument placements may have been too aggressive, so just want to get a sense of how, the aggressive guidance in 2Q factor into third quarter and beyond? Brian McKeon : Just on the third quarter, we talked about to restate, 9.5% to 10.5% overall organic and 10.5% to 12% recurring with the day-to-day and a half. I think that the day benefit is a little bit higher on the recurring fees, Mike, so it\u2019s largely reflective of the year to-date trend adjusting for the days and we feel very good about our momentum and our ability to deliver that. So it\u2019s not anything specific to Q3 timing other than the day change. Michael Ryskin : Okay, got you. I think I heard you wrong on the overall number then. Brian McKeon : And I would say on the instrument \u2013 look, we\u2019re -- as you know we\u2019ve got -- we\u2019re always trying to build off of a high base and we are executing very well on driving EVI gains and expanding our Catalyst installed base and we think we\u2019ve got our full-year impact of my back half outlook properly calibrated. Michael Ryskin : Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Okay, thank you, all, with that we\u2019ll conclude the call. I want to thank our employees for the very strong progress and performance in Q2 and the advancement of our purpose, which is enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people of livestock around the world. I\u2019m also \u2013 and also I\u2019m grateful for the confidence that our investors have in IDEXX and our business model. We look forward to being able to share our work with investors and seeing all of you in person or through a Reg FD Presentation at our Investor Day in a couple of weeks. So thank you very much for calling in. Cynthia, that\u2019s it. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T, the Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.",

Participating in the call this morning are Jay Mazelsky, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian McKeon, Chief Financial Officer; and John Ravis, Senior Director, Investor Relations. IDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements. Listeners are reminded that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the forward-looking statements notice in our press release issued this morning, as well as in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website, idexx.com. During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. In reviewing our second quarter 2019 results, please note, all references to growth, organic growth, constant currency growth and comparable constant currency growth, refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2018 unless otherwise noted. To allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit his or her questions to one with one follow-up as necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits we will take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to, Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. Today I will take you through our quarterly results and our updated outlook for the full year 2019. I will also provide an overview of our preliminary for 2020. Jay, will follow with his comments. IDEXX delivered continued strong revenue and profit gains in Q3. In terms of highlights, revenues of $605 million grew 11% as reported and 12% organically, including over 1% of growth rate benefit from equivalent days. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 14% organically, including nearly 2% of equivalent day growth rate benefit, reflecting double-digit gains across U.S. and international markets. EPS of $1.24 per share increased 21% on a comparable constant currency basis, benefiting from better than expected organic revenue growth, which supported 130-basis-point improvement in constant currency operating margins. Excellent operating results are keeping us on track towards strong full year financial performance. In terms of our 2019 revenue outlook, we are refining our full year guidance to $2,395 billion to $2405 billion, a $5 million increase million increase at midpoint, incorporating our strong Q3 performance. This reflects an updated full year organic growth of 10% to 10.5% overall and 11.5% to 12%, for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, both at the higher end of our previous guidance range. We are adjusting our 2019 EPS guidance to $4.72 to $4.78 or 15% to 16% growth on a comparable constant comparable constant currency basis. This is $0.12 per share lower than our prior guidance midpoint incorporating $0.18 per share in projected Q4 charges related to our recently announced CEO transition. Adjusting for this impact, our outlook is $0.06 per share higher at midpoint and corporate benefits from our strong third quarter operating performance and lower projections for full year net interest costs. In terms of our preliminary 2020 outlook, we are projecting revenue of $2,610 billion to $2,650 billion, reflecting organic revenue growth of 9% to 10.5%, supported by sustained high growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Our 2020 EPS outlook is $5.30 per share to $5.46 per share or comparable constant currency EPS growth of 17% to 20%. As we will discuss our 2020 EPS outlook incorporates $0.11 per share in projected headwinds, from year-over-year FX impacts and expectations for approximately $0.12 per share and reduced tax benefits from share-based compensation activity. Let\u2019s begin with a review of our Q3 revenue growth performance by segment. Excellent third quarter revenue growth results were driven by continued strong momentum in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues increased 13% organically, reflecting 14% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, including nearly 2% growth benefit from equivalent days in quarter. By region, U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 13% organically, including nearly 2% of growth rate benefit from equivalent days, reflecting continued strong gains in consumables and Reference Labs. U.S. CAG recurring diagnostic growth remains primarily volume driven with net price gains continuing to trend in the 2% to 3% range. We also maintained consistent exceptionally high levels of customer retention across modalities. IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth continues to outpace broader market trends, which improved in the quarter. In Q3, total visits per practice growth was 1.4% year-on-year with clinical visits per practice growing at 2.7% and overall revenue per practice increasing 5.3%, reflecting continued solid growth trends in the U.S. Companion Animal Healthcare market. International CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue increased 16% organically in Q3, including approximately 1.5% of equivalent day growth benefit. International consumable revenue gains normalized for approximately 2.5% of benefits from equivalent days sustained at approximately 20% and international organic revenue Reference Lab growth improved to high single-digit rates. Globally Reference Lab and consulting service revenues grew 12% organically in Q3, supported by consistent low to mid-teen volume-driven gains in the U.S. Robust U.S. lab growth continues to be driven by strong same-store sales growth at IDEXX customers, augmented by net customer acquisition benefits and moderate net price gains. As Jay will discuss in October we closed on the acquisition of Marshfield Laboratories, a national service provider based in Wisconsin adding to our U.S. market capabilities. Global consumable revenues increased 18% organically in Q3, including nearly 3% of equivalent day growth benefits. These results reflected strong growth across U.S. and international markets driven by increases in diagnostic test utilization and expansion of our installed instrument base. We had an outstanding quarter in terms of high quality instrument placements, supporting double-digit year-on-year in our Economic Value Index or EVI. Overall, premium instrument placements increased 14% year-on-year, driven by 18% year-on-year growth in catalyst placements, which supported an 18% year-on-year increase in our global catalyst installed base. Globally we placed 1,898 catalysts in the quarter with 360 yet new and competitive accounts in North America and 910 new and competitive placements in international markets. We also achieved 965 premium hematology placements globally up 18% and 589 SediVue placements, in line with strong prior year levels. Please note that, we have expanded the data shared in our quarterly earnings snapshot available on our Investor Relations website, to include premium instrument placements by category and region, as well as quarterly tracking of our global premium installed base. Rapid assay revenues grew 10% organically in Q3, including nearly 3% of equivalent day growth day growth benefits, reflecting continued expansion of 4Dx plus, specialty, SNAP feline [ph] and first generation products. Growth in high customer retention in our rapid assay business continues to benefit from expansion of our engaged SNAP Pro installed base, supported by an additional 2,683 SNAP Pro placements globally in Q3, bringing our global installed base to over 34,000. Veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging systems revenues increased 6% organically in Q3, driven by continued strong gains in VSS recurring service revenues. Overall, segment revenue gains were constrained in Q3 by comparisons to very strong prior year digital system placement levels. In terms of our other business segment performance in the quarter, Water business revenues grew 7% organically, supported by continued solid growth across U.S. and international markets. Livestock poultry and Livestock poultry and dairy revenue, increased nearly 10% organically. Third quarter results were driven by strong year-on-year gains in Asia-Pacific markets, which benefited from a favorable prior year comparison. The prolonged outbreak of African swine fever continues to negatively impact the swine population in China. However, demand for new diagnostic testing programs and increased diagnostic testing for alternative poultry food sources, offset lower recurring swine testing volume levels in Q3. Health herd screening levels while down from strong prior year levels were also relatively higher than expected in the quarter. Turning to the P&L, operating profit in Q3 increased 19%, as reported and on a constant currency basis, driven by solid profit gains across our CAG, Water and LPD segments. Operating margins increased 130 basis points on a constant currency basis, reflected solid gross margin gains and operating expense leverage on high revenue growth. Gross profit increased 13% as reported, or 14% on a constant currency basis, in Q3. Gross margins increased 60 basis points on a constant currency basis, supported by mix benefits from strong consumable revenue growth, lab productivity gains and moderate net price increases. Foreign exchange hedge gains, which are reflected in gross profit were approximately $3 in Q3 and approximately $7 million year-to-date. Operating expenses in Q3 increased 9% as reported, and 10% on a constant currency basis, resulting in 70 basis points of constant currency operating margin leverage. Operating expense increases were driven by growth in R&D spending and increased costs related to our expanded global CAG commercial capability. EPS in Q3 was $1.24 per share, including benefits of including benefits of $4 million or $0.05 per share, related to share-based compensation activity, which was approximately $0.03 per share higher than projected. On a comparable constant currency basis, EPS increased 21%. Foreign exchange net of favorable year-on-year hedge impacts had an immaterial impact on operating profit and EPS in the quarter. Year-to-date free cash flow through the third quarter was $195 million. We continue to expect free cash flow of 60% to 65% of net income for 2019. This reflects a consistent outlook for full year capital spending of $160 million to $175 million, including approximately $70 million of combined incremental spending related to our Westbrook main headquarter expansion and our German core lab relocation. Our strong cash flow generation supported the allocation of $91 million in capital towards the repurchase of 330,000 shares in the quarter. We have maintained a strong balance sheet with leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA of 1.39 times gross and 1.24 times net of cash at the end of the quarter. We continue to maintain a 2019 full year outlook for reduction in average shares outstanding from stock repurchases of approximately 1%, which assumes that we maintain net leverage at similar multiples of EBITDA. We now project annual net interest expense of $3.5 million, an improvement of $2.5 million compared to our previous guidance. In terms of our updated P&L outlook for 2019, as noted, we are refining our full year reported revenue guidance to $2,395 billion to $2,405 billion, reflecting an organic growth outlook of 10% to 10.5% and CAG recurring diagnostic organic revenue growth of 11.5% to 12%, both at the higher end of our prior guidance range. At midpoint, this reflects a $5 million reported revenue increase factoring in our strong third quarter performance. In this updated outlook, modest projected benefits from our recently completed U.S. lab acquisition are offset by refined projections for FX impacts. For the full-year, we now expect a 2% headwind from FX and revenue growth. In terms of EPS, we are lowering our 2019 full year guidance by $0.12 per share at midpoint to $4.72 per share to $4.78 per share incorporating $0.18 of impact related to the CEO transition. These results in comparable constant currency growth of 15% to 16% for 2019 including approximately 4% of growth impacts related to projected Q4 transition charges. Costs related to the separation agreement will lower full year 2019 operating profit by an estimated $13.4 million and year-on-year operating margin improvement by approximately 55 basis points. Incorporating this impact, our updated outlook is for 55 basis points to 70 basis points in full-year constant currency operating margin improvement or 110 basis points to 125 basis points of improvement excluding the Q4 transition charge impact, which is consistent with the higher end of our prior guidance range. Our full year operating margin outlook includes expectations for higher levels of year-on-year operating expense growth in Q4, including effects from the advancement of an additional expansion of our U.S. commercial field resources, which Jay will discuss in his comments. Strong full year operating margin performance excluding transition charge impacts and benefits from lower projected interest costs yield approximately $0.06 per share in full year operational EPS benefit compared to previous guidance. Our updated EPS guidance assumes a 2019 effective tax rate of approximately 20%, including approximately 1% of impact related to CEO transition costs. This tax rate also includes an updated estimate of $15 million or approximately 3% in full year projected tax rate benefit from exercise of share-based compensation, netting approximately $0.02 of upside compared to previous guidance. At the midpoint of our guidance estimates, this equates to about 17% per share and full year share-based compensation tax benefit. Operational share-based compensation tax benefit upsides are mitigated by $0.02 per share of negative impact related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our last conference call. Our 2019 EPS guidance now assumes $0.06 in negative full year impact related to FX charges net of hedge impacts and for the full year 2019, we are projecting hedge gains of $11.5 million. As we look at 2020, we are targeting continued strong revenue and profit growth consistent with our long-term goals. Our preliminary revenue outlook is $2,610 billion to $2,650 billion, reflecting expectations for 9% to 10.5% organic revenue gains, supported by sustained high growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Our guidance reflects expectations for overall reported revenue growth of 9% to 10.5% with an estimated 0.5% foreign exchange headwind, related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, offset by year-on-year benefits from completed 2019 acquisitions. Our preliminary 2020 EPS guidance of $5.30 per share to $5.46 per share incorporates expectations for operating margin improvement of 100 basis points to 150 basis points on a constant currency basis, including approximately 50 basis points of year-on-year improvement, related to lapping the Q4 2019 charges related to the CEO transition. At rates assumed in our press release, we estimate that FX will decrease reported operating margins by approximately 30 basis points and EPS by approximately $0.11 per share, net of established hedge positions, which we estimate will result in $6 of net pre-tax gains in 2020. Our projected 2020 effective tax rate is 21% to 22%. This outlook assumes $3 million to $5 million or approximately $0.05 per share in share-based compensation tax benefits, assuming our current share price. Note that our projections for share-based compensation tax benefits share price, incorporates timing of future option expirations. As IDEXX transitioned from seven year to 10-year option lives in 2013, this has the effect of lowering the level of options scheduled to expire in 2020, contributing to a $0.12 reduced projected tax benefit in 2020 compared to 2019. For 2020, we are projecting a 1% reduction in shares outstanding related to share repurchases, at assumed consistent net leverage ratios and net interest expense next year of $36 million.  Adjusting for changes in currency and share-based compensation tax benefits, this 2020 EPS outlook equates to a projected 17% to 20%, comparable constant currency growth rate. We look forward to providing an update and more detailed review of our 2020 guidance in our year end conference call. That concludes our financial review. I will now turn the discussion over to Jay. Jay Mazelsky : Good morning, and thank you, Brian. IDEXX\u2019s third quarter results reflected solid growth, across our Companion Animal, Livestock and Water Diagnostic businesses, an outstanding achievement by our IDEXX team globally. High growth in CAG Diagnostic revenues continues to lead our performance, with attractive flow through benefits to profit, keeping us on us on track to deliver strong full year operating results. Excellent commercial execution is a key theme in our continued growth momentum and enhancing capability in this area consistently delivers a high return on investment. In our U.S. CAG business we benefit from the increased IDEXX engagement with customers, in an underdeveloped diagnostics market, with solid growth momentum, as evidenced by the 2.7% growth in same-store clinical visits seen in the quarter. Our U.S. commercial team remains highly productive, delivering 13% CAG Diagnostics recurring organic revenue growth in the U.S., including approximately 2% benefit from equivalent business days. Execution was excellent across the Board, resulting in both impressive revenue gains from all modalities and sustained high customer retention rates. Increased customer engagement is helping to drive sustained, low to mid-teens organic growth in Reference Labs, led by same-store testing expansion and double-digit organic gains and consumable revenues, supported by our expanding premium instrument installed base. Instrument placements were excellent in the quarter, led by 14% year-on-year growth in U.S. new and competitive catalyst placements. This supported a 10% year-on-year expansion of our U.S. catalyst installed base and double-digit growth in U.S. EVI. SNAP Pro placements were also robust in Q3 with over 2,200 placed in the U.S., up 77% year-over-year. SNAP Pro bring significant workflow electronic medical record and charge capture benefits that complement our differentiated rapid assay point-of-care diagnostics. Importantly, customers who are connected to SNAP Pro are highly engaged and stay with us longer. Our U.S. commercial team continues to make excellent progress in advancing our preventive care initiative. In Q3, we enrolled 330 new practices, bringing our total enrollees since program launched to nearly 3,500, almost two-thirds of our VDCs had at least one new customer enrollee in the quarter. As discussed at Investor Day, a key commercial goal is to inspire customers to increase the use of medically relevant blood work and clinical visits. When we consider blood work as a representative proxy for diagnostics utilization, it was included in only about 8% of clinical wellness visits in 2018. The increased rate of diagnostics testing with blood work and practices post enrollment in our preventive care program is notable, specifically if we take our 2017 preventive care enrollees who have now been in the program for over a year, the average annual increase in a percentage of wellness is that include blood work is approximately 1% per year since 2016. This compares to approximately 20 to 30 basis points of annual increase for non-enrollees. These convincing early success indicators reinforce the 1% to 2% contribution to annual CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth potential we see from this initiative. Our strong growth in the U.S. demonstrates that diagnostics as a category continues to grow in importance and relevance to the veterinary profession. Our customers are in turn asking our category experts to spend more time partnering with them. The combination of increasing customer engagement and key growth initiatives like IDEXX Preventive Care, strong operating results and commercial momentum and a healthy product pipeline gives us confidence to once again expand our commercial presence in the U.S. We are already underway with an 8% expansion in our U.S. field based professionals, which we expect to be largely in place by the beginning of Q1 2020. As with our past field expansions, these are thoughtfully planned and supported by detailed regional analytical modeling that considers a number of factors including territory size and specific geographic differences such as traffic patterns and population growth. The most important factor is the market opportunity, as calculated by our ability to grow our installed base, expand diagnostic testing and expand category share across in-clinic and Reference Lab modalities. While we have said this before it bears repeating. The data continues to prove out that the more time we spend with customers, the more they grow with IDEXX. This expansion will bring us to an estimated 530 field-based professionals in the U.S., up from 490 at the end of 2018. We are very excited by the opportunity this expansion affords us heading into 2020. The category of diagnostics is increasing in importance on a global basis as well. And as a result, we are seeing the benefits from our recently completed CAG commercial expansion in international markets. We saw 16% international CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue organic growth in Q3 including approximately 0.5 equivalent business days growth benefit. These gains were again led by international consumables growth of approximately 20% organically, normalized for equivalent business base and supported by continued expansion of our catalyst installed base, which increased 26% year-over-year. Our international Reference Lab, showed improvement year-over-year, high single-digit growth, benefiting from the completed commercial expansion, strong commercial execution, as well as focus on customer service and IDEXX 360 programs that are increasingly multi-modal in character. The IDEXX 360 program is gaining traction, with our international customers, supporting excellent instrument placements and double-digit growth in EVI, benefiting from a 28% year-on-year increase in placements, the new and competitive accounts internationally. In addition to excellent commercial execution, the ongoing adoption and expansion of IDEXX differentiator\u2019s one of our industry-leading investments and innovation, is a second key theme, supporting our strong growth performance. Our strong reference lab growth in markets like U.S. for example, continues to be supported by high-growth in parasitology, driven by growing adoption of our proprietary fecal antigen test. In the U.S. approximately 60% of parasitology panels run in our reference lab included, PCDX antigen in the third quarter, up from approximately 50% in Q3 2018. Our performance leading 4Dx plus franchise also continues to expand. In the U.S. in addition to sustained solid growth in clinic, we are seeing high levels of incremental growth in 4Dx plus testing in our Reference Labs, following engagement with our preventive care programs. As we have highlighted in the past, only approximately 36% of dogs in the U.S., received a vector-borne disease test to some kind, while only approximately 15% of dogs in the U.S. receive a full vector-borne multi-analyte test. This expansion of 4Dx plus usage is a very encouraging sign, with additional long-term benefits for vector-borne disease testing. We also continue to make excellent progress advancing SDMA as an essential element of the chemistry panel, which our reference lab customers have benefited from since 2015 and launch to our catalyst installed base in early 2018. We now have over 70% of catalyst customers globally, who have purchased Catalyst SDMA, while almost 60% have used it. This has translated into a total of 2.9 million run since its introduction on a slide. We are also very excited about the new SDMA based chronic kidney disease staging guidelines that were issued in September by the international renal interest society. This is an expert panel of internationally renowned nephrologist, who establish evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease. The full incorporation of SDMA into CKD staging guidelines reflects the widespread recognition that SDMA is an accurate measure of kidney function. The impairment of which may be due to kidney disease or other disease processes. These updated SDMA base staging guidelines, are the next step in improving not only early diagnosis of CKD, but also tailoring treatment to individual patients. IDEXX SDMA has transformed the landscape of how veterinarians manage patients with impaired kidney function. Finally, we continue to extend our capability and advantages in veterinary software, by advancing our software on multiple fronts simultaneously. Our goal is to provide a truly comprehensive technology offering that both independent practices and corporate groups around the world rely on to run their businesses. Q3 was again a strong quarter for global placements of new Cornerstone, Neo, Adamana and Smart Flow Systems. Inclusion of software systems, on the IDEXX 360 program is accelerating commercial efforts in North America. In the U.S. practice management software placements grew 35% year-over-year. Sticking with the U.S., we have seen it in a precedented pace of Cornerstone upgrades, the version 9.1 with more than 2,700 practices upgraded year-to-date across North America, driven by customer demand for the all new user interface and streamlined clinician experience. We achieved yet another clinical development milestone for Cornerstone Cloud in Q3, which is now successfully running in a live environment for more a quarter. Initial customer feedback is extremely positive and we look forward to eventually making the many benefits of the cloud available to the thousands of customers that value Cornerstone as the standard bearer in practice management software. Q3 was another strong quarter for growth for Webex with a 29% year-over-year increase in subscriptions. Our enterprise management and analytics platform for corporate groups continues to make big strides, providing a command and control center for corporate group C-suite and VetConnect plus the most widely used app in veterinary medicine had another strong quarter, growing out new functionality for sharing diagnostic results with pet parents and growing to more than 29,000 engaged practices globally. In addition to our strides in growing our business organically, we are also pleased to highlight our recent acquisition of Marshfield Labs and the addition of their employees. Marshfield is a highly professional well-run laboratory that has a national customer base with a relatively stronger presence in the mid and upper Midwest regions. We look forward to quickly bringing our unique innovations like SDMA, Fecal Antigen and VetConnect PLUS to name just a few the Marshfield customers many of whom we work with today. In summary, we feel very good about our business progress across a range of strategic fronts and believe we are well-positioned to build on this momentum in 2020 and deliver on our long-term financial goals. Before I conclude and on behalf of all my IDEXX colleagues around the world, I\u2019d like to extend our thanks to John Ravis and our best wishes for John\u2019s continued rehabilitation. John\u2019s love and affection as a preparative translated into his deeply held beliefs on the unique role that pets in their care play in our lives. As a result, he always reminded us of what\u2019s possible and what IDEXX could contribute through our unique diagnostics and software that expand the health and wellbeing of the pets we love. It\u2019s a John\u2019s vision that IDEXX as an organization will remain committed to helping strengthen the role and relevance of the veterinarian as the key to improvement the lives of pets and animals and the people who love them. On a personal note, I am looking forward to continuing to work with John both on the Board of Directors and as a trusted adviser. And with that, we will open it up to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will go to the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Ryskin : Hey, guys. How you are doing? Jay Mazelsky : Good morning, Mike. Brian McKeon : Good morning, Mike. Michael Ryskin : First off congrats on the quarter really solid results in Q3, but I want to ask on the 2020 outlook briefly. First on the operating margin gains, you highlighted a couple of different moving pieces with the CEO charge in the fourth quarter. But you have also seen some really strong gains in gross margins this year. How should we think about the moving pieces in the progression extra you talked about 100 bps to 150 bps operating margin constant currency? How do we think about price on the gross margin line some of the cost controls in SG&A? You also have the sales force expansion that you talked about in the U.S. So a couple of different moving pieces. So how does that all shake out? And then a follow-on just on the broader outlook for next year, slightly more conservative view for the top line organic $9 million to $10.5 million, I realize still very early on. But anything really changing in the market just high level or is this just any particular area you could point to within Reference Labs or consumables or instruments or is this just initial guide, I want to take a cautious glance at the markets? Brian McKeon : Yeah. Let me start with the operating margin clarification. You are right. The -- we have a compare here with the CEO transition charge that we tried to highlight. So our preliminary outlook of 100 basis points to 150 basis points, we noted included 50 basis points related to the comparison or favorability related to the charge, so if you adjust for that. It\u2019s 50 basis points to 100 basis points which is very consistent with our long-term goals and what we were indicating, what our goals were for 2020 back at Investor Day. We are demonstrating that this is a leverageable business model that delivers a nice profit flow-through when we grow. At the rates we are targeting and have good progress with that as reflected in our Q3 results and our outlook for 2019. I would highlight heading into next year we have a couple of factors that are built into the operating margin outlook. One is that, we have two significant new facilities that are coming online next year or new core lab in Germany, as well as our new Westbook headquarters. And we will -- that will involve a level of incremental costs and we will grow into that overtime. But initially that will be something that has the effect of moderating margin gains. And as you pointed out, we have got the U.S. expansion, the additional expansion of U.S. commercial resources and we have a pretty healthy growth rate now in our year-on-year investment as we are fully ramped with our international expansion that we implemented a little earlier this year and we are investing in our R&D initiatives consistent with our stated goals. So we have got a healthy level of investment, some factors that will moderate kind of the upside on that. But we feel very comfortable with the underlying 50 basis points to 100 basis points of improvement outlook for next year. On revenue the 9% to 10.5%, we noted, reflects a consistent outlook for sustaining continued strong CAG Dx recurring revenue growth which is really the main driver of our of our growth outlook. We are looking to build on the solid progress we have made on both the U.S. and international fronts on growing CAG Dx recurring revenues, which are right in line with our long-term goal ranges. In terms of overall growth, I would highlight, we are continuing to maintain a calibrated outlook on LPD revenues. That is influenced by -- we still have some macro factors going on with African Swine fever and we are -- we didn\u2019t know are going to be up again some tough compare on health for screening, which is a relatively smaller business for us, but we had much better-than-expected growth this year in that area and we are cautious about some potential pullback on that as dairy producers in places like Australia, New Zealand for rebuild their herds in 2020. So, it\u2019s a smaller business for us, but at the margin that kind of reinforces to us our comfort levels with, the 9% to 10.5% overall organic growth outlook. Jay Mazelsky : And Mike just in terms of the market itself we feel good about where the market is. As Brian indicated, we saw 2.7% clinical growth in Q3 over 5% revenue growth $5.3 million and that doesn\u2019t include new practice formations. So our outlook assumes that the market stays in that range. Michael Ryskin : Great. Thanks. Operator : And we will go to the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Please go ahead. Ryan Daniels : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Jay, one for you in regards to Marshfield Labs. It\u2019s a little unique to see you purchasing lab assets, let alone in the U.S. So I am curious what the strategy was there, and then more specifically, outside of the lab network and the client base, you will get from that was there anything proprietary that can be broadened into the IDEXX labs existing network that you garner from the acquisition? Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. Ryan, thank you for the question. We are very excited by the Marshfield acquisition. It\u2019s a high-quality, very professional laboratory, we are adding approximately 2,000 Marshfield customers. These -- some of which we already do business with. Our focus is really on being able to maintain continuity of service, understand the needs of those customers better and introduce some of the innovations that we have like SDMA and fecal antigen and VetConnect PLUS over time to them. So it\u2019s a -- we think it\u2019s a great acquisition, it\u2019s a great laboratory and it fits in well with our overall strategy. Ryan Daniels : Okay. And then I may have missed this, this is a different question, but in commenting on the 8% uptick in Q4 on the North American customer facing organization. Is there a specific focus of the hires you are making there, if it\u2019s VetTech, is it field sales reps, is it anything in particular that it\u2019s kind of a focus and will you be changing the territories at all or is it just on many existing territories? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : All right. Thank you, Ryan. Let me give you an overview of the model and I will give background on the why. Essentially, at its core, we are adding 23 territories and our model is we have a VDC per territory. So we will be going from 220 -- 227 territories to 250. On average, the VDC today has about 110 accounts and post-implementation of the expansion will be down to about 100 and as is the case when we expand the number of VDCs, we augment the number of field service reps to support them, generally two VDCs per single FSR. So any addition to the 23 VDCs and new territories, we are adding 12 FSR. So that represents the core of the change. And our thinking really is, when you take a look at our market. We have been growing strongly in the U.S. and the average business we do with the -- with our customers has grown. And so from both the depth and breadth standpoint, we have many customers that are 40%, 50% bigger in terms of the business they do with us just compared to three years ago. Their expectation as they do more business with us is that they see more of us, whether it\u2019s full staff trainings or understanding their practice better, identifying opportunities where we can help them. And then you layer on top of that initiatives like preventive care, which take relatively more time of the VDC upfront, including things like on-boarding and getting those customers calling Marshfield Labs that I mentioned and the couple thousand of new customers. There\u2019s a real draw on the capacity of our commercial channel. We tend to look -- there\u2019s a couple of metrics that we look at, that sort of guide our thinking about this. One is a reach to revenue metrics, so if you take a look at Q3, we are about 90% reached the revenue, which is where, historically, we like to be. But when you take a look at reached a customer, which incorporates not just IDEXX customers, but competitive customers, we are about 75% or so. So we are a bit lower than we would like to be. We think there\u2019s really good opportunity outside of the IDEXX installed base still. So that guided our thinking and how we implemented this. Ryan Daniels : Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. And I want to just wish my best to John as well. Thank you. Jay Mazelsky : Thank you. John Ravis : Thanks, Ryan. Operator : And you have a question from the line of Erin Wright. Please go ahead. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. Do you know how much of the Marshfield customers are IDEXX customers on the point-of-care side or generally speaking, how much overlap, maybe there is, so we can think about like an opportunity for cross-selling and what does that put your U.S. lab count at now, following the Marshfield transaction? And then, can you kind of just broadly speak to the broader competitive environment across reference laboratory, are there any changes there? I know there have been some more competitive movements on the SDMA side or for kidney disease testing, I guess, how do you compare your SDMA capabilities at the reference lab compared to others? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : All right. So there\u2019s -- I will take a few of those. There are a number of questions in there. As I indicated, there\u2019s about 2,000 in total Marshfield customers, many of whom we do business with currently. We haven\u2019t broke out the specifics in terms of in what modality across all the modalities. Generally speaking, most customers in the U.S. do business with us and in some fashion, whether it\u2019s rapid assay or our software products. So we do think that there\u2019s a really nice opportunity to cross-sell, our full solutions. But our focus is really first on being able to understand those customer needs and work with them. In terms of, you had mentioned specifically competition to SDMA. In our view, there are really no comparable offerings, the SDMA in the marketplace. We continue to make excellent progress, expanding SDMA adoption is differentiated. I gave you some statistics in terms of not only the reference lab but SDMA on the slide, with our catalyst. We are super excited by the updated guidelines of virus that Elevates SDMA, really from an adjunct or chronic care disease treatment into a primary recommended diagnostics biomarker. Alongside puratone, of course, for staging of CKD, an important thing to keep in mind, in terms of the staging guidelines is that, veterinarians rely on them to classify by the patient, severity and progression of kidney disease. So this guides that the treatment paths that they take, it helps the market standardize on best care approaches for the patient. It drives -- we think more standardized or better outcomes for the marketplace as a whole. It assures the pet parents that their pets getting the best treatment. So we think this is a really big deal and that\u2019s something we are excited by. Erin Wright : Okay. Brian McKeon : And Erin, we had 52 labs before -- in the U.S. before this and we will be adding a few additional locations, including the Core Lab for Marshfield, which we are as Jay mentioned it\u2019s a really high quality operation. Erin Wright : Okay. Great. And then, just generally speaking, also how would you characterize current demand trends across the veterinary market. I guess, you noted this slight acceleration in the clinical visit growth this quarter and what was driving that, you think, and is that normalized for the day impact as well? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. The -- I mean, we think the market is healthy, it\u2019s 2.7% clinical growth and that\u2019s the important metric that we track, because it involves -- those visits involve diagnostics testing. The overall practice growth is $1.4 million in revenue at 5.3% was pretty healthy. It\u2019s -- we think it\u2019s largely consistent with what we have seen in the past. It does tend to be some variability quarter-to-quarter. We have got a pretty good beat on the market as a result of the -- our analytics approach with 7,500 practices. We take data from five of the leading PIM systems. So we have got a nice proportional both regional and practicized representation in this data and I think what it\u2019s showing is pretty consistent, strong growth across the market. Brian McKeon : Hey, Erin. Just on the days impact clarified. Basically, what we had in Q3 was an extra Monday. And so what that really impacted was our business, we do a lot of shipping on Monday so sees positive benefits to consumables and rapid assay, which we highlighted and actually very limited impact on labs, and it wouldn\u2019t have really impacting the market metrics in that context, it\u2019s more of a shipping dynamic. Erin Wright : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We will go to the line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Thanks for the question. I wanted to follow-up on the revenue guidance, Brian. I didn\u2019t hear a range for your expectations for the CAG Diagnostic recurring growth next year. I just wanted to know if you could kind of talk about the type of growth you expect and kind of what the key factors we should have in mind that would influence on the growth outlook for next year? Brian McKeon : Yeah. we -- in our preliminary guidance we don\u2019t get that granular. We did want to highlight that in the 9% to 10.5% outlook we are looking to sustain the high level of growth that, this year we are guiding to 11.5% to 12%. So all indications are we are trending quite well and looking to build on that as in the U.S. right now we are about 11.5% adjusted for days year-to-date and kind of 13.5% in international and international actually improved a bit in the quarter. We had relatively better reference lab growth, which is something we have been working on. So we are looking to build on that, and we will be sharing more specifics as we get through the finalization of our planning process and we will share that on the year-end call. Nathan Rich : Placement numbers that you gave, it looks like you saw some nice improvement internationally specifically in new and competitive placements. Could you maybe just talk about what drove that and specifically what you are seeing in China, I think that had been a little bit of a drag earlier this year, I just wondered, if you had seen improvement there? Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. So we saw really nice placement growth and consumables growth internationally, 20% normalized and I think if there is a couple of factors. It\u2019s clearly been an ongoing focus for us. I think the maturing of our VDC model, continuing maturing of our VDC model is helpful. We are getting nice traction with the IDEXX 360 program, with our international customer\u2019s, I think they appreciate what that brings in terms of flexibility in the ability to access our solutions. And the products themselves, it fits our international markets really well, I think we have said in the past that Catalyst One was initially designed for international markets in terms of its cost profile and physical footprint and we just -- we continue to see that bit in our sales momentum and Brian\u2019s going to address the China question. Brian McKeon : Yeah. China, we had a very good performance on new and competitive placements and we continue to work through the lapping of compares to prior levels where we had high levels of vet test upgrades. So the mix has shifted. We are -- that does constrain our overall revenue growth, reported revenue growth somewhat, but I think the underlying quality of the placements we are doing new and competitive accounts across regions, contributed very high quality performance from our lens in the quarter and the double-digit EVI gains that we talked about. So, we feel good about the progress we are making across markets and that sets us up well. It\u2019s really about expanding our global installed base, and as Jay highlighted, we are up 18% year-on-year with our catalyst installed base globally, and that really sets a solid foundation for continuing to grow our consumable revenues at high rates. Operator : We will go to the line of David Westenberg. Please go ahead. David Westenberg : Hey. Thanks. Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. So just first you noted customer shifting preferences to cloud based solutions. I know that PIMS has very high barriers and switching out seems it is rather on the difficult side. So are you having a lot of success in terms of switching customers or adding on that cloud -- the Cornerstone cloud solution, is that the way you kind of see the market shaking out? Can you just maybe run through competitive dynamics in that PIMS market, please? Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. So I will take that. Thank you for the question, David. The -- our PIMS offering is very broad. So we address the market in the -- more of the advanced workflow with Cornerstone, but also those practices that may be single or mobile practices with NEO. And what we see is our veterinary customers like all customers, whether independent of industry, you appreciate ease of use benefits, they specifically focus at workflow, does it help them address the challenges, both from a care delivery standpoint, as well as a business standpoint in the practice. And what they are telling us with Cornerstone 9.1, which is our most recent revision, is that they really appreciate the improvements we have made in user interface and the ability to do the work that they do with fewer clicks, with just all the easiest benefits. So we are seeing really nice placements across the Board. It\u2019s included, as I had mentioned, in our IDEXX 360 program, so more customers are deciding, choosing to go all in with us in terms of diagnostics and software, what they find is when they do that, it works better. In terms of Cornerstone Cloud, that as I indicated, is really in field trials. At this point, we think the marketplace over time will migrate at least in part, as you had indicated. PIM systems tend to be a bit sticky, but I think customers increasingly recognize that there are some benefits that having their software in the cloud in terms of lower cost for being able to maintain the hardware in the practices. And somewhat more quick or a number of revisions that they can expect on an ongoing basis without having to shutdown their practices for an hour, two hours, that type of thing. So lots of benefits, we think, over time, that the market will move in that direction, and we will be ready for it. Yeah, keep in mind, our NEO practice management system is already in the cloud. David Westenberg : All right. Well, thank you very much for the color. I am just going to do one really quick housekeeping question. I really do appreciate how you call out the extra day in the quarter. So I was just wondering in terms of housekeeping. Is there an extra day or one less day then in Q4 that we need to be -- that we need to anticipate and then maybe as we look at 2020, is there any kind of growth headwind in terms of extra days there, just as a housekeeping question. Brian McKeon : On Q4, we will have one less Monday, but we anticipate some positive benefit around the holiday week time link. So I think it\u2019s a modest net headwind. There may be some modality impacts, but we are not calling that out and the team is telling me what the next year is -- it\u2019s relative -- we get some benefit in Q1 for leap year, but I think on the full year, it\u2019s relatively neutral. David Westenberg : Appreciate it. Thank you so much. Brian McKeon : Yeah. Operator : We go to the line of Jon Block. Please go ahead. Jon Block : Great. Thanks guys. Good morning. Jay, maybe the first one for you, just curious about the increased North American sales force, I guess, why now, I think, it was a couple of quarters ago, you said, you guys are sort of good with your commercial infrastructure and I get it. It\u2019s a business that responds well to increased investments. But just curious what you are seeing in the marketplace that caused you to move now versus maybe in a couple of quarters and then I have got a follow-up. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. So Jon, I think, it really comes down to what I was describing earlier. A number of our customers, a large number of our customers in our territories have gotten bigger over time. And there\u2019s more demand from the VDC in terms of working with these customers. It\u2019s an expectation that they have as they use more broader and deeper. And then when you take a look at some of these initiatives like preventive care, as I mentioned, they really do require more time upfront, in terms of getting these customers on-boarded and helping make them successful. You add in a couple of thousand more customers for Marshfield Labs. As well as what we said at Investor Day, it\u2019s $11 billion addressable market, $3 billion in wellness business alone. So we continue to see that when we apply time with customers that they grow more and use more of our diagnostics and we do better. It really just comes down to that math. Jon Block : Okay. Fair enough. And then Brian, maybe the second one for you on the guide, some moving parts on stock-based comp. I think largely in line, but the midpoint of revs was a tad below where we were. So I guess the question is, does this bake in what we may see from a new product standpoint in 2020, does it reflect that? And then part B that is just I thought you alluded to net interest expense of $36.5 million, which seems like a decent step-up year-over-year, despite rates continuing to go down. So I want to make sure I got the right number there and if so, why do we have a step-up? Thanks guys. Brian McKeon : Yeah. Just on your first question, our outlook for 2020 incorporate projections for growth across the business including adoption of our current innovations and any new introductions. So that\u2019s factored in. We feel it\u2019s very much in line with kind of how we have been trending. We always target growth, Jon, at the higher end of what we talk about, that\u2019s what we try to execute and just calibrate that appropriately. But we are looking to build on the strong growth rates and are very comfortable with the outlook in the context of our long-term goals. And on your question related to interest expense, the -- it was $36 million and that included an assumption for -- we did not assume a change in interest rates. So I think that if there are reductions in things like variable interest rates we would there may be some modest benefit to that. But that was our assumption and it assumes a flat net leverage ratio, so basically will -- we saw some benefit this year, reductions in interest rates, we are not projecting the underlying interest rate rejections into next year in the broader market. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Mark Massaro with Canaccord. Please go ahead. Mark Massaro : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess, Brian, as we think about the 2020 guidance, I assume, you are contemplating the inclusion of Marshfield Labs. So it looks like Marshfield has about three or four Reference Labs, with particular strength in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio. One is, can you give us a sense of what your share was for Reference Lab in those regions and how you think that might bump it up? And then can you give us a sense for what level of growth you think that Marshfield could add in basis points to your reference lab line in 2020? Brian McKeon : Yeah. So just on Marshfield, it\u2019s a lab with national customers. So we see this as adding to our national capability. Within our guidance, Mark, it is roughly $15 million, the annualized revenue we expect is about $15 million from Marshfield, that\u2019s what\u2019s baked in and it\u2019s offset by FX. So in terms of when you see our reported organic numbers those two factors offset. So I would say, we have got that factored in. We are very excited about adding Marshfield to the IDEXX family and working with their employees and very pleased with their capabilities. And as Jay mentioned, I think there\u2019s real opportunities for us here nationally to leverage our innovations and expand our IDEXX business with those customers. Mark Massaro : That\u2019s excellent. And so I also wanted to ask about potential expansion internationally. I believe you have over 900 people on the field globally, which is certainly a significant global infrastructure. But can you give us a sense for where you are at internationally and whether or not you are contemplating future sales hires OUS? And I guess, related to that, you have got the new lab in Germany opening up next year. Can you just speak to some of the dynamics in play both competitively and organically internally focused in Europe for 2020? Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. So we are -- we just completed our expansion in Europe and internationally, and we are comfortable where we are. We think we have the right capacity to address the opportunity and our growth projections. So at this point, there\u2019s no additional plans to go beyond that. It\u2019s really -- our focus at this point is really maturing out the organization. What we find is that it takes time to continue to develop deeper relationships with customers and with those deeper relationships where we are able to grow, so that\u2019s really the focus. In terms of the Reference Lab marketplace, as Brian indicated earlier we are pleased with where we are right now. We are focused on being able to improve our reference lab performance and we think, over time, with the IDEXX 360 program and the maturing of our VDC sales organization, we can build on that. We are excited to be able to bring on the new Reference Lab in Germany, we think that, that positions us well additional capacity in the future but no other specifics at this point. Jay Mazelsky : Okay. And okay -- so thank you. With that, we will conclude the call. I want to thank our employees for the very strong progress and performance in Q3 and the advancement of our purpose, which is enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock around the world. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for using AT&T Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.",

Participating in the call this morning are Jay Mazelsky, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian McKeon, Chief Financial Officer; and John Ravis, Senior Director, Investor Relations. IDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements. Listeners are reminded that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the forward-looking statements notice in our press release issued this morning as well as in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website, idexx.com. During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. In reviewing our fourth quarter 2019 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth, constant currency growth and comparable constant currency growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2018, unless otherwise noted. Fourth quarter 2019 and full year 2019 comparable constant currency, operating expense growth, operating profit growth, operating margin growth and comparable constant currency EPS growth exclude the impact of the fourth quarter 2019 CEO transition charges. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results and to provide an update on our financial outlook for 2020. IDEXX achieved continued strong financial performance in Q4, which supported delivery of full year revenue and EPS gains aligned with our long-term financial goals. In terms of highlights, we achieved 10% organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter driven by 11% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues and 10% organic growth in our LPD and Water businesses. Solid fourth quarter gains supported full year organic revenue growth of over 10% and nearly 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Our full year EPS was $4.89, an increase of 21% on a comparable constant currency basis, supported by 120 basis points in comparable constant currency operating margin improvement. Note that our comparable growth rates and comparable operating margin improvement metrics now exclude impacts from Q4 CEO transition charges. These charges reduced operating profits by $13.4 million in Q4, aligned with expectations; and EPS by $0.14 per share after tax, approximately $0.04 better than initial projections, reflecting updated tax provision estimates. Full year EPS results included $0.22 per share in tax benefit from share-based compensation activity, $0.05 per share above our guidance estimates. We also saw an additional $0.04 of below-the-line upside to our earlier guidance estimates related to final tax provision estimates and lower-than-projected interest expense. We're well positioned to build on these strong results in 2020. We're maintaining our outlook for 9% to 10.5% organic revenue growth reflected in our increased guidance range of $2.620 billion to $2.655 billion in annual revenues, which include updated FX estimates. We're raising our EPS guidance range by $0.12 to $5.42 to $5.58 per share, reflecting 13% to 16% comparable constant currency EPS growth. Positive revisions to our preliminary guidance range reflect the flow-through of our 2019 performance with consistent operational improvement assumptions and favorable updates to projections for interest expense, share-based compensation tax benefits and FX impacts. We'll walk you through the details of our 2020 guidance later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results by segment. Q4 results were supported by continued strong momentum in our Companion Animal Group. Global CAG revenues were up 11% organically driven by 11% organic gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, net of a modest equivalent days' headwind overall. By region, U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues increased 10.5% organically net of a 0.5% equivalent days' impact. Consistent strong U.S. gains were supported by low- to mid-teens organic growth in reference lab sales, double-digit gains in VetLab consumables and solid gains in rapid assay revenues. U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume-driven, with net price gains trending in the 2% to 3% range. We also maintained high levels of customer retention across modalities. U.S. CAG Diagnostics revenue growth continues to outpace broader market trends. Total visits per practice were relatively flat in the quarter on a same-store basis with a 4.3% increase on overall same-store practice revenue. Total market clinical visit growth was 1.8% in Q4, following relatively strong Q3 results, with some moderation in visit gains earlier in the fourth quarter offset by stronger gains in December. For the full year, clinical same-store visit growth increased 2.5% of the 7,500 practices in our data set, up from 2.1% in 2018, reflecting continued solid market expansion in diagnostic services. International CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues increased 12% organically in Q4, net of a modest overall equivalent day's headwind. International results reflected mid-teens organic growth in consumable revenues supported by a 25% year-on-year expansion in our Catalyst installed base outside of the U.S. Strong consumable gains of nearly 20% in Europe and continued strong gains in Canada and Latin America were moderated to a degree in Q4 by impacts related to the timing of shipments in Asia, which benefited Q3 2019 and prior year Q4 results as well as equivalent day impacts. For the full year, international consumable revenues increased nearly 20% organically. International reference lab sales increased organically at consistent high single-digit rates in Q4 with solid gains across our major regions. For the full year, global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues increased nearly 12% organically, reflecting 11% gains in the U.S. and 13% growth in international markets, aligned with our long-term goals. By modality, global reference lab and consulting services revenues expanded 11% organically in the fourth quarter supported by a nearly 1% equivalent day growth benefit with an additional 2% of reported growth benefit related to the initial integration of Marshfield Labs. Full year organic growth of 11% in lab revenues was driven by consistent strong growth in the U.S., supported by continued high same-store sales growth at IDEXX customers. Global VetLab consumable revenues grew 12% organically in Q4 net of a 1.5% equivalent day headwind. For the full year, VetLab consumable revenues increased 14% organically driven by double-digit growth across U.S. and international markets, supported by increases in diagnostic test utilization and ongoing expansion of our premium instruments installed base. We had another excellent quarter in terms of high-quality instrument placements in Q4, supporting double-digit year-on-year growth in our Economic Value Index or EVI. Global premium placements increased 13% year-on-year in Q4 driven by 23% year-on-year growth in Catalyst placements, supporting a 19% year-on-year growth in our global Catalyst installed base. Overall, we placed 2,517 Catalysts in the quarter, with 456 at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 8% year-on-year; and 1,119 new and competitive placements in international markets, a 24% year-on-year increase. We also achieved 1,248 premium hematology placements, up 7%; and 713 SediVue placements, down 4% compared to strong prior year levels. Overall, our SediVue global installed base is now over 8,900 instruments, up 35% year-on-year. Rapid assay revenues grew 4% organically in Q4, reflecting solid gains across U.S. and international markets, net of a 1.5% equivalent-day headwind. For the full year, rapid assay revenues grew nearly 8% organically, reflecting continued solid growth of 4Dx Plus specialty and first-generation products. Growth, high customer retention in our rapid assay business continued to benefit from ongoing expansion of our engaged SNAP Pro installed base, supported by additional 10,000 placements in 2019, bringing our global installed base to over 37,000. Veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging system revenues increased 9% organically in Q4, supported by double-digit gains in VSS and continued solid expansion of digital imaging services. Overall, global CAG revenues grew nearly 11% organically in 2019, and we're targeting continued double-digit organic gains in the CAG business in 2020. In terms of our other lines of business. Water revenues grew 10% organically in Q4, including approximately 1% benefit from equivalent days, supported by solid gains across our major regions. For the full year, Water revenues increased 9% organically with faster operating profit growth resulted in 47% full year operating margins. We're very pleased with our continued momentum in the Water business and are targeting continued high-single-digit organic growth in this highly profitable business in 2020. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue in Q4 increased 10% organically. Strong Q4 growth results were supported by benefits from the sales of diagnostic testing programs for airports and African swine fever in China, which offset declines in core swine diagnostic testing as well as solid growth in poultry testing and herd health screening. Q4 results also benefited from favorable year-on-year comparisons related to timing of government and distributor orders. For the full year 2019, our LPD revenue was up 6% organically, with relatively higher operating profit growth benefiting from productivity improvement and cost controls. We're pleased with our progress in expanding our LPD revenues and profits in 2019 in a very dynamic global climate. In 2020, we're targeting flat-to-modest organic growth in our LPD business as benefits from growth in our pregnancy testing franchise and African swine fever testing programs are moderated by expected ongoing pressures on broader swine diagnostic testing in Asia and bovine government disease control programs in Europe as well as tough compares related to strong 2019 herd health screening levels. Turning to the P&L. Gross profit was up 10% on a reported basis in Q4 or 11% adjusted for foreign exchange impacts. Gross margins decreased slightly on a constant currency basis, reflecting increased investment in our reference lab business related to day lab capacity, route expansion, system investments and acquisition integration, which offset benefits from moderate net price gains and continued strong consumable revenue growth. Foreign exchange hedge gains, which benefited gross profit, were $3.5 million in Q4. Operating profit in Q4 was flat as reported, including impacts from CEO transition charges. On a comparable constant currency basis, operating income increased 12%, reflecting solid profit gains across our CAG, Water and LPD segments, supported by high revenue growth. As expected, comparable constant currency operating margin gains were relatively flat in Q4. Operating expense growth increased to 10% on a comparable constant currency basis driven by increases in global CAG commercial capability and R&D. As we'll discuss in our guidance update, investment impacts will carry into the first half of 2020. For the full year, operating profit increased 13% as reported or 16% on a comparable constant currency basis. This reflects an operating margin of 23% and an increase of 120 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis, which excludes CEO transition charge impacts. Constant currency operating margin gains reflected a balance 50 basis points of gross margin improvement and 70 basis points of operating expense leverage on strong volume growth. EPS in Q4 was $1.04 per share, including $0.05 per share in tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable constant currency basis, EPS increased 17%. For 2019, EPS was $4.89 or 21% on a comparable constant currency basis. For the full year, foreign exchange rate changes decreased EPS by $0.05 per share, net of FX hedge gains of nearly $11 million. Full year EPS results included $19 million or $0.22 per share in tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity, which provided 3.7% of benefit in our 2019 effective tax rate of 18%. We had interest expense of $30.6 million for the year, net of approximately $2 million of capitalized interest related to major facility projects. Free cash flow was $304 million for 2019 or 71% of net income. Capital spending came in at $155 million, including $58 million of combined investment or approximately 14% of net income related to our Westbrook, Maine headquarter expansion and German core lab relocation with some favorability to earlier estimates related to timing of major project cash deployment. We allocated $304 million of capital towards the repurchase of 1.215 million shares for the full year 2019 at an average price of $250 per share. This included repurchases of 532,000 shares in Q4 for $139 million. Our balance sheet is in an excellent position. We ended the year with $991 million of debt, $90 million in cash and $560 million in capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our leverage ratios as a multiple of adjusted EBITDA were 1.4x - 1.45x gross and 1.32x net of cash at year-end. Our strong financial performance and disciplined capital allocation supported achievement of a 46% after-tax return on invested capital, excluding cash and investments for 2019. We're well positioned to build on the strong performance in 2020, with a financial outlook aligned with our long-term goals. We're increasing our reported revenue guidance range to $2.620 billion to $2.655 billion, up $7.5 million at midpoint, including approximately $5 million of benefit from updated FX assumptions. We're maintaining consistent guidance for 9% to 10.5% organic revenue growth supported by continued strong CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth of 11% to 12%. Our guidance assumes 0.5% growth rate benefit from completed 2019 acquisitions, which is offset by a projected 0.5% FX growth headwind resulting in projected revenue growth of 9% to 10.5%. We're raising our 2020 EPS outlook to $5.42 to $5.58 per share, an increase of $0.12. This aligns with a comparable EPS growth of 13% to 16%, reflecting a consistent outlook for 50 to 100 basis points of comparable constant currency operating margin improvement. The $0.12 increase in the EPS outlook compared to our preliminary guidance includes approximately $0.05 in combined benefit from the flow-through of 2019 operating performance and favorable updates to assumptions for interest expense and projected reductions in average shares outstanding. We're now projecting approximately $35 million in net interest costs in 2020 and a 1% to 1.5% reduction in average shares outstanding, with both metrics aligned with an assumed maintenance of our net leverage at 1.5x EBITDA. Our updated outlook also reflects $0.05 in projected tax benefit from share-based compensation activity. We're now projecting an effective tax rate in 2020 of 20% to 21%, including $7.5 million to $9.5 million or 1.5% in tax rate benefit from exercise of stock-based compensation in 2020, which equates to $0.09 to $0.11 per share. Finally, our guidance benefited by $0.02 from updated FX assumptions. Overall, we're now projecting an estimated $0.09 negative year-on-year impact from FX, net of $5 million of projected hedge gains in 2020. In terms of free cash flow, we're targeting deployment of $140 million to $155 million in capital spending, including approximately $35 million related to the completion of our Westbrook headquarters, German core lab projects and the acquisition of real estate associated with a U.S. core lab. For 2020, this results in an outlook for free cash flow of 75% to 80% of net income including approximately 7% impact from these discrete investments. In terms of our first quarter outlook in 2020, we expect Q1 reported revenue growth in the 9.5% to 11% range, reflected organic gains of 10% to 11.5%, including a projected 1% equivalent-day tailwind related to the leap year. We expect our operating margins will be moderately below prior year levels, reflecting stepped-up commercial and lab investments advanced in the second half of 2019 and as we continue to integrate our Marshfield acquisition and onboard our Westbrook headquarters expansion. We expect operating margin gains in 2020 will be driven by second half performance as we grow into our scaled investments, including our new headquarters and German core lab facility. That concludes the financial overview. Let me now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Jonathan Mazelsky : Good morning, and thank you, Brian. IDEXX had a strong finish to 2019, with double-digit growth across our Companion Animal, Livestock and Water diagnostic businesses. Core CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue, which now represents over 3/4 of overall company revenues, grew 12% organically for the full year. Excellent execution across our businesses enabled us to deliver organic revenue of 10%-plus and comparable constant currency EPS growth of 21%, aligned with our long-term financial goals. Return on invested capital at 46% for the year was exceptional. The progress we are advancing on key strategic fronts positions us well to build on this performance in 2020. Outstanding commercial execution is an essential pillar in our organic growth strategy, and we consistently see a high return in increasing these field-based capabilities that allow our sales professionals to spend more time with customers. Expansion in the number of our global customer-facing resources and investments in enabling commercial systems in areas like Salesforce or service club were two areas of focus in 2019. We completed the U.S. commercial expansion in Q4 and started the year with our expanded U.S. team in seat and trained. We now have 530 field-based professionals in the U.S. to support market development, more than double the number from five years ago. As we enter 2020, we anticipate some settling in during the first quarter of the expansion as sales professionals, including those newly recruited, develop relationships in their new or reconfigured territories. Notably, we accomplished this expansion in Q4 while delivering 425 new and competitive Catalyst placements in the U.S., a record number. We also continue to make progress with preventive care, with 360 new enrollees in the quarter to reach over 3,800 enrollees in the program to date. Customers are embracing the IDEXX Preventive Care turnkey solution and increasingly view it as a foundational pillar in their own practice strategies. We believe that our North American commercial resources are properly balanced at this point with the addressable market opportunity. And in 2020, we will focus on driving productivity in our expanded sales force, which becomes even more effective over time with tenure and with deeper customer relationships. Our commercial capability and performance in international markets also continues to advance as they build tenure and competencies with key commercial programs like IDEXX 360. The commercial team's priorities have been driven by the Economic Value Index of an instrument placement that prioritizes high-value competitive chemistry placements, resulting in 24% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements in Q4 to a record of more than 1,100 units. Our Catalyst installed base outside of North America grew 26% year-over-year, supporting nearly 20% organic revenue growth at IDEXX VetLab consumables internationally in 2019. We expect to gain global leverage and further strengthen execution in 2020 with our enhanced field global commercial organization, as previously announced. Leading with innovation includes expanding our testing platforms is another key growth pillar. We are excited by the new innovations that we announced at VMX earlier this month. These were enthusiastically greeted by customers as clinically rigorous and value-added since veterinarians embrace new and expanded tools that enable them to raise the standard of care in workflow-efficient ways. This year, we are bringing bile acids to our Catalyst platform with shipments expected this quarter. Catalyst bile acids as a measure of liver function brings reference lab test quality in clinic. This is a great example of how we constantly make our Catalyst platform more valuable to customers. Catalyst has steady innovation heartbeat, with eight clinically important tests launched over the past eight years. The technology-for-life benefit of Catalyst is supporting continued global expansion of this best-in-class testing platform. Following another great year of instrument placements and customer retention, as of the end of 2019, approximately 41,000 practices of Catalysts installed. Even with the successful installed base expansion, we estimate there remain approximately 70,000 addressable placement opportunities for Catalyst alone around the world. Our innovation focus increasingly uses large clinical data sets with AI and machine learning to develop highly capable algorithms that assist clinicians with even the most challenging patients. This is the case with SediVue Dx, our groundbreaking platform with Neural Network 5.0, leveraging 350 million images launching this quarter. We are adding advance bacteria-detection capabilities made possible by proprietary reagents, leveraging patent-pending technology at no additional charge for our 8,900 customers. Seeing bacteria is clinically relevant and especially challenging because of their very small size, the difficulty of seeing bacteria in highly cluttered image and because debris could be mistaken for bacteria due to similarity in appearance. Moreover, because our in-clinic analyzers are all connected by smart service, we will be able to quickly update our global installed base with no customer disruption. In reference lab, our broad and differentiated service portfolio, including fecal antigen Dx continues to support strong same-store customer growth. Because the fecal antigen test does not rely on the visual confirmation of parasites eggs, it's able to uncover twice as many infections as O&P alone, identifying the presence of intestinal parasites earlier in the life cycle of the infection. We're also further expanding our reference lab offering with an exciting new service, digital cytology, announced at VMX for launch in North America in February. Cytology results often have at least a two day turnaround time. With our new digital cytology service, we are transforming the speed at which customers receive results with expert interpretation to within two hours, seven days a week, 365 days a year. We're able to do this by leveraging existing capability of an integrated IT workflow, the wide adoption of customer-facing applications like VetConnect PLUS, a field service diagnostic workforce of about 150 field service reps to install and train customers and a global network of more than 100 veterinary clinical pathologists. We continue to invest in further improving our lab service offering internationally. We're excited about adding our state-of-the-art core German reference laboratory in late spring of this year to our sophisticated global and regional hub-and-spoke laboratory network. Adoption and utilization of IDEXX SDMA continues to advance nicely in clinic and lab diagnostic modalities. 75% of global Catalyst customers have ordered Catalyst SDMA and have now run at 3.5 million times. In fact, in North America, that number is almost 80% adoption. IDEXX SDMA has also been included in almost 28 million chemistry panels at IDEXX reference labs. Customers are increasingly seeing SDMA, a direct measure of GFR impairment or kidney function, as a standard of care. In fact, the American Animal Hospital Association has updated their canine diagnostics wellness testing guidelines by life stage, and testing guidelines now for the first time include SDMA. Our veterinary software offerings continue to enjoy robust customer adoption. Customers who use our software applications believe that they are an outstanding enabler to deliver excellent patient care and to running their practices in an efficient manner. Q4 was another strong quarter for new placements of Cornerstone, Neo, Animana and SmartFlow systems. In North America, we had record patient management software placements, including cloud-based and on-premise software for 63% year-over-year growth at installs for the quarter. We introduced a much improved user experience update with Cornerstone software version 9.1 in March of last year, and we are pleased that well over half of our installed base upgraded by the end of 2019. Work on Cornerstone cloud continued to progress on schedule in Q4 with very positive customer feedback, positioning us to scale for commercial launch later this year. IDEXX Web PACS enjoyed another strong quarter with 23% year-over-year increase in subscriptions and a customer installed base of more than 4,500 subscribing practices. We recently released for the end of Q1 delivery a cloud-based software update. It provides new functionality, powered by artificial intelligence, automatically that corrects image orientation and sorts images by body part, potentially shortening read time by 25%. Overall, across these multiple integrated software offerings, we are providing the most comprehensive technology stack offering relied on by independent practices and corporate groups around the world. In addition to our progress in our core CAG business, we also had strong performance in our Water and Livestock diagnostic businesses in the fourth quarter, with both achieving 10% organic revenue growth. We continue to expand our high-return Water business globally through focus on commercial execution. Our Livestock business has also shown tremendous resilience this year in the face of macro challenges and continued input from the African swine fever in Asia. Looking ahead, we are optimistic about the long-term potential of our business and our ability to sustain its high growth. One of our key strategic goals is to grow CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue, which in 2020, we're targeting at 11% to 12%. Major drivers include the strong global momentum and expanding our installed base of premium instruments, continued customer adoption of IDEXX' differentiators like integration and ongoing new platform features and our expanded commercial capability aligned with building on this momentum. Over the next 25 years, we see tremendous opportunity for ongoing growth of CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues with a global addressable Companion Animal Diagnostics market of over $30 billion, with the majority of that existing outside of the United States. We remain focused on our commitment to providing exceptional service to our customers and improving the standard of care to enable the best clinical decision-making and healthy practice growth. Before we open the call to questions, I want to thank our employees and congratulate them for the accomplishments in 2019 in pursuit of our purpose to enhance the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock. Okay. And with that, we'll take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we will take the first question from the line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : Brian, maybe just starting off on how we should be thinking about kind of the cadence of organic growth this year. I think you said the first quarter would be 10% to 11.5%. I think that includes 100 basis point benefit from the leap days. So if we back that out, I think the range is consistent with kind of the full year guidance that you gave for organic growth. So should we be expecting sort of a relatively consistent cadence over the balance of the year? Brian McKeon : We'll obviously provide more detail as we work through the year, but I think that's an accurate read, Nate, is that we've got a full year outlook of 9% to 10.5%. We'll have some benefit from days in Q1. We have, I think, a bit of a headwind in Q2. But net-net, on balance for the year, those should wash out. And I think our 11% to 12% recurring CAG growth is very much in line with the trends that we've been seeing if you adjust our fourth quarter results for the days' impact and just some of the shipment timing effects we noted in Asia, which were modest but can impact the growth rate a bit. We're basically right in the middle of that range and looking to build on that in 2020. Jonathan Mazelsky : And I would add to that. We're well positioned to sustain that 11% to 12% gain that - we reflect in our going for 2020. You start with the fact that it's a good market backdrop. We saw good clinical visit growth over 2019, 2.5%. We have really nice growth and momentum in our - the expansion of our premium installed base : 16% in total, 19% in Catalysts, 35% in SediVue and those result in consumables growth as customers use those products. We're pleased with the adoption we see around IDEXX innovation. Customers are very enthusiastic about the differentiators we've introduced in past years as well as VMX. And we have an expanded sales force, which is out there partnering with customers, driving awareness and education and ultimately, consideration. And then we note that - as Brian mentioned in his remarks, we have very high retention across all of our modalities. Customers tell us that they appreciate the differentiators we bring, like integration and the platform extensions they've come to rely on. So we're feeling like we're in a very good position to sustain that growth. Nathan Rich : Jay, that's helpful. And just a follow-up on your comments on the end market. You kind of noted a strong 2019. Obviously, 4Q is a little bit softer. I know there's kind of always quarter-to-quarter volatility. Is that sort of kind of what you would attribute the 4Q number to? And I think, Brian, you had mentioned December was maybe a little bit stronger. I'd just be curious to know if you've seen that improvement continue into January. Jonathan Mazelsky : Yes. So the - Q4 was solid, 1.8% clinical growth. Keep in mind, we focus on the clinical growth piece. That's where the veterinarian actually sees the patient and where diagnostics is used as a whole. Now that came off fairly strong Q3, and as noted, a little soft going into the quarter, but picked up in December. So we're positive on the market. We think it's a strong market in 2020 and we don't see anything from a change standpoint. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Ryan Daniels : A couple of follow-ups on the new digital cytology. I'm curious, number one, if you can speak to the early feedback you got, particularly at VMX? And then number two, as my follow-up, I'm curious what the revenue will look like from that? I know there's an instrument but also reading at the reference lab. So will that be in the equipment or reference lab lines? Or how should we think about the revenue model? Jonathan Mazelsky : Right. Thank you, Ryan. Let me give you just some market backdrop and the feedback from VMX. Customers were really very enthusiastic about digital cytology service. Typically, the veterinarian will see patient everyday with lumps and bumps. And they'll take a sample, prepare a slide, look at it under a microscope and then decide whether or not they need to send it out for expert interpretation. That process very often takes a couple of days. But it can - depending upon when they send it in, like kind of Friday, can take 4 or 5 days or so. So they were very, very appreciative and enthusiastic about the ability of being able to send it to us and get a result back with an expert interpretation within two hours and be able to do that all hours of the day, every day of the week and all days of the year. So the - and the reason we were able to do that, by the way, is because we were able to fit that into our existing infrastructure and investments that we've made, in terms of integrated IT workflow; having a field service organization, which is out there who can help install these systems and onboard and train customers on slide preparation; having clinical pathologists around the world to be able to provide that service. In terms of market size, and then I'll hand it over to Brian to talk a little bit about revenue. The way we think about this is about 5% of practices are higher-volume users of cytology. So we define that as 5-plus cases per month. About 6,000 of IDEXX practices actually send today out cytology to our reference lab for expert interpretation. That's 6,000 of about a little over 20,000 practices that we do business with in reference labs in some measure. So that gives you just a scope of what we're talking about. We think as they continue to use this, there's potential benefits in using more of it over time and more customers adopting it. Brian McKeon : Yes. And I think that one way to think about it financially, Ryan, is it is a factor that will be supportive of sustaining the 11% to 12% CAG Dx recurring growth company, including the strong growth that we've seen in U.S. reference labs. It's a valued service and a differentiator and I think something that we believe can support, continue to expand that franchise. And in terms of instrument revenues, as Jay noted, it's a relatively smaller set of the market that would likely be earlier adopters of the instrument. And we'd anticipate this will be integrated into 360-type program placements, more in the second half of the year as we kind of build market awareness and get the service up and running. But it's not calling it out as a distinct material driver. I think it's something we anticipate will build over time. But we're very excited about it as another example of how IDEXX is adding to the scope of services that we're providing, adding to our differentiation and value and leveraging that to drive the strong double-digit growth in CAG Dx revenues that we should to achieve. Operator : Next, we will go to the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : I want to follow up on an earlier question just about market conditions, just get a little bit more specific. Maybe you could, I guess, help put my mind at ease. I've had a lot of questions over recent days and weeks about some international markets : the wildfires in Australia towards the end of the year. You've had similar weather in California or heat waves in Europe affect you. Just curious if that had any impact. And also on the recent coronavirus outbreak in China, just a lot of attention there in the market, obviously. And if you could sort of size your China exposure, how much of that is companion versus livestock? And if you've seen anything in terms of vet visits or sort of what you're seeing there in that market and how that factors into your expectations for 2020? Brian McKeon : Yes. Why don't I start with that, Mike, and hopefully, I can hit on some of your specific questions? I'm sure Jay can expand on that. But in terms of the coronavirus as context, China for IDEXX is a little less than 2.5% of our overall revenues - all of our revenues in China. So it's a - we have a relatively smaller exposure to that market. Over half of that revenue is LPD. So in terms of the more consumer-driven aspect of that business, it's a relatively smaller exposure. We have seen limited impact to-date. We are monitoring it, of course and - but have not factored a specific kind of impact into our outlook at this point. We've got a range for performance. We're comfortable with that. And I think the headline there is relatively smaller for IDEXX and it's relatively early on to kind of be calibrating more impacts. I think you had a specific question on the Australia wildfires. We did not see a meaningful impact on that in our results. Again, it's something that we're monitoring, but we had very good results in Australia, continued good results. And I think we've - the European market, we highlighted that we had nearly 20% consumable growth in the fourth quarter, outstanding instrument placements. I think we - the market - and continued solid results in labs. So I think we feel the market backdrop in Europe looks quite healthy. Michael Ryskin : Yes. A quick follow-up. I appreciate all the color there. You also cited a lot of investment on the gross margin line. You saw that in this quarter and you mentioned some of that's going to continue through 2020 across the reference lab and the rest of the business. Could you help us think through the pacing there, sort of how that progresses over the course of the year? And is that - is this a slight step-up in investment? Is this something that's going to be the run rate go forward? Or is this sort of relatively onetime that should play out over the course of - you'll see the benefits of this over the course of many quarters? Brian McKeon : Yes. I think if there's any investment in our business, it's truly onetime. I think we're always adding capability. But what we were trying to highlight was that we had, through the second half of 2019, a number of investments that we advanced on the lab front in terms of our expanding our capacity, adding day labs. We had some system investments that we've been making; initial integration of Marshfield, which we'll continue; and obviously, some of the investment we made in the commercial organization in the U.S. And just trying to highlight that, that is going to be on a year-over-year basis, carrying into the first half of 2020. And there are a couple of discrete factors that will be additive to that, and that's basically our Westbrook headquarters, which is coming online in Q1. So we'll have the depletion of that starting to factor into our OpEx growth. And in the second quarter, we will be having the impact of the German core lab coming online. So the net of that is it's - it wasn't intended to signal incremental investment in the labs other than those discrete areas in the Marshfield acquisition but just trying to highlight that we anticipate our margin gains that we're targeting for next year will be second half-driven, will have some moderate pressure in Q1 and basically, just as we grow into those investments. And we would reinforce our long-term goals of 50 to 100 basis points-plus of constant currency annual margin improvement supported by strong recurring revenue growth, so no changes on that front. Operator : And next, we will go to the line of Jonathan Block with Stifel. Jonathan Block : Maybe just a couple, more high-level ones for me. Jay, anything on the competitive landscape that's evolved or maybe that you expect to evolve? Zoetis has had Abaxis for some time now, and they purchased a couple of labs. I know it's early, but - and you got another player that's also making a bigger push in international markets. So curious for your thoughts and any color or details that you see on calling and the potential evolution from a competitive standpoint? Jonathan Mazelsky : Yes. Thank you. So the - it's always been a competitive market, and it's clearly still a competitive market, and we continue to perform very well, as we've highlighted this morning. Our focus is really on growing and adding value for our customers. A lot of our volume growth, as Brian highlighted, comes from same-store sales, comes from existing customers, creating awareness and adoption of relevant testing. So from a strategy standpoint, it's really continuing to be able to work with those customers, introduce the innovations, take our commercial capability, expanding commercial capability, partner and help those practices succeed. So that's really the focus. The - a lot of competitive intensity, but that really hasn't changed. And we continue to do well and we continue to experience moderate price increases on the 2% to 3%, net basis. So we're feeling good. Jonathan Block : Okay, great. And there's a few surprises I thought about on the P&L, so I'll stick high level. Jay, your thoughts on - and willingness to work with other players in the industry to help drive diagnostics growth? And what I mean by that is, that's what you want to do. You're working with Trupanion in some shape, way or form on pet insurance. But there was chatter at VMX that you're going to partner with QE with their sort of their prescriptions platform. And so as leading the company, I'd love to get your thoughts on how you see these opportunities evolving for the company over the next couple of years and IDEXX' willingness to take a more aggressive role there. Jonathan Mazelsky : Yes. So we've had ongoing partnerships with the specialty diet that - in pharma and software companies in the marketplace. The way we tend to think - I'll address the software piece and the integration piece specifically. The way we tend to think about that is we take an open systems approach. So a group of customers, once it reaches a certain size of critical mass come to us and say that they would like us to integrate an application into our PIMS systems, then we do it. We want to be able to give the customers the workflow that they desire. But in terms of overall partnering at VMX, we participated in a park study, which showed the efficacy - the superior efficacy of fecal antigen. So always looking for ways in appropriate sort of partnership structures of developing the market for diagnostics. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Erin Wright with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Erin Wright : I had a similar question, just given some of the bundling tactics of your competitors. I was curious if you could better leverage your unique positioning in this market as sort of an agnostic player but also partner with large pharma manufacturers to do your own creative bundling with therapeutics or other product offerings? I guess, have you contemplated those sort of partnerships or collaborations more so recently than you have in the past? I'm just curious how that's evolving. Jonathan Mazelsky : Yes. So when we talk to customers, what customers tell us, is that they - when they're looking at diagnostics and they're looking at solutions to adopt, they believe that it's highly differentiated. It's a highly differentiated category in their practices. It's a decision that they make through the lens of how to deliver best care. It tends to be separate from how they think about therapeutics or specialty diets. They are making typically long-term decisions because of systems that they're buying that need to be integrated that they may have in their practice 5, 10 years. So from a buying standpoint and partnering decision, the customer really separates those two. So the - that hasn't changed with the recent acquisition of some of our competitors. Erin Wright : Okay, okay. That's helpful. And then where do you stand now in terms of market share on your PIMS systems? Where are we at across the industry in terms of converting to cloud-based systems? And can you speak to your positioning around the competitive front there as we head into some sort of potential wave of system upgrades as well? Jonathan Mazelsky : Yes. So we did - we've done very well this year in terms of payment placements. Cornerstone, we've been able to upgrade more than half of our installed base of Cornerstone with a completely new user interface. We've been able to do this because we have a field-based organization, field service reps who go out and partner with customers. We also - our Neo system, which is really more geared towards general practice customers and mobile customers, is native cloud-based. That's received just, I think, very enthusiastic reception, and we've been able to grow that nicely. But the key is it's not so much in the PIMS system per se. It's in the connectivity that we're able to provide between software and our diagnostics and the applications that work together. So what customers tell us is they appreciate our PIMS systems. But what they really like is they like the fact that it all works better together, so the PIMS and the applications and VetConnect Plus and the diagnostics. And that ability to support their workflow clinically and from a business standpoint and capturing charges and work that they do is what sets us apart and continues to really provide strong differentiation. Operator : Next, we will go to the line of Andrew Cooper with Raymond James. Andrew Cooper : With the integration going as expected, was there anything that sort of surprised you? And I guess, from a from a customer reaction perspective, I think sometimes we view some of the regional players as - sometimes view it as an alternative to the larger options that are out there in the market. So has there been any pushback from customers? And then from a margin perspective, the gross margin, I think, in 4Q was maybe a little lighter than we had expected. So what's the opportunity kind of on Marshfield? And in general, how much maybe did mix impact in the quarter? But on Marshfield specifically, to capture synergies and get kind of that incremental revenue up to - similar to your consolidated lab margins or kind of how you view that in terms of the extra capacity that you added with the acquisition? So any color there would be great, and I appreciate the feedback. Jonathan Mazelsky : Great. Yes. So the Marshfield integration is on track. We're excited by Marshfield. It really - we've welcomed over 2,000 customers from Marshfield, and they now have access to IDEXX' differentiated tests like SDMA and fecal antigen and VetConnect Plus. And the initial reception has been enthusiastic from those customers. We - keep in mind that a good number of those customers were IDEXX customers already. They use one of our modalities. They may have used our software systems. So it's not like they didn't know us. This just gives us a chance to work more closely with them and to provide reference lab services. I'll turn it to Brian if Brian would like to make a remark on margin and what we see there. Brian McKeon : Yes. As expected, we - as we're working to integrate Marshfield, there are some impacts from that. And that we did highlight that as one of the factors, and that will continue into the first half. We're - we have work going on, on that front. But look, over time, I think we're - we've demonstrated and we're confident that the addition of customers into our national lab network and supporting them through our over 50 labs now in the U.S., which is how we think about this business as a national business, is something that we would anticipate in getting leverage from and is supporting the longer-term goals that we have for margin improvement from our reference lab network. So it was a near-term factor and will be a near-term factor to a degree, and we'll get leverage on that over time. It will support our margin improvement going forward. Operator : And we'll take one final question. Brian McKeon : Yes, this will be our last question. Thank you. Operator : That will be from the line of David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities. David Westenberg : So some of the feedback from veterinarians on the cytology instrument starts the conversation in oncology. So I apologize, I'm going to kind of ask an industry kind of wide question here. But does this - how do you see the oncology market kind of playing out in the next, say, 3 to 5 years? Is there opportunities here in diagnostics, in the reference labs? Is there opportunities in therapeutics kind of the way we have in the human market with, say, cancer profiling or early detection of cancer? Just if you can give me kind of a broad overview of that and maybe just cytology kind of start that conversation. Jonathan Mazelsky : Yes. So the oncology service is something that exists in the marketplace today. It's centered more around specialty practices and there's lots of different areas in oncology, just like there are on the human side in terms of both drugs and therapeutics and LINAC systems and chemotherapy. So that's a very broad question with lots of different areas. From a diagnostic standpoint, that's something we're always taking a look at. There's - around genomics and proteomics and being able to detect cancer earlier. Certainly, digital cytology, in many instances, you're looking for cancer. So it does begin that discussion when a patient comes in with mumps and bumps and wants to know whether or not their pet is okay. Okay. And so with that, thank you. With that, we'll conclude the call. I want to thank our employees for the very strong progress and performance in Q4, for the full year of 2019 and for the advancement of our purpose, which is enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock around the world. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive TeleConference Service. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. And welcome to the IDEXX Laboratories First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. Participating in the call this morning are Jay Mazelsky, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian McKeon, Chief Financial Officer; and John Ravis, Senior Director, Investor Relations. IDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements. Listeners are reminded that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the forward-looking statements notice in our press release issued this morning, as well as in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website, idexx.com. During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. In reviewing our first quarter 2020 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth, constant currency growth, and comparable constant currency growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2019, unless otherwise noted. To allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit his or her questions to one with one follow-up if necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions. So, please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we will take our -- take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Jay Mazelsky. Jay Mazelsky : Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the call. Today, we are pleased to report strong Q1 results, despite late quarter impacts from the COVID-19 crisis. As we will discuss, the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting our care customers in unusual ways, given broad based social distancing efforts, which are changing the ways veterinarians are prioritizing and providing care. We are working through these near-term dynamics, ensuring that we are fully supporting these essential health services in a way that prioritizes our customers\u2019 needs. We are doing this while we continue to advance our business strategy. Today, Brian will review our Q1 results and provide an update on current trends that we are seeing in our markets and our business. He will also describe the steps that were taken to mitigate near-term impacts and position ourselves for a strong and sustained recovery in the highly attractive pet health care market. I will then talk more about how we are seeing trends evolve in the market and how we are managing our business for the near-term and the long-term in this context. Now, I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian McKeon : Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. We will be using a somewhat different format for today\u2019s financial review. I will begin with an overview of our first quarter financial results, which resulted in solid revenue and profit gains despite late quarter impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We will then spend time discussing the near-term dynamics that we are seeing in the companion animal health care market, including evolving impacts from COVID-19 containment approaches on clinical visits and diagnostic testing levels. We will review how we plan to manage in this environment and highlight the steps we have taken to mitigate near-term P&L impacts and strengthen our balance sheet and flexibility to position our business for a strong recovery. While we are optimistic about the ability of the pet health care market and IDEXX\u2019s business in particular to rebound strongly from near-term COVID-19 effects we are withdrawing our full-year financial guidance as we work through these dynamics. As such, we won\u2019t be providing an update on that front today. Let\u2019s start with an overview of our Q1 results. IDEXX delivered 9% organic revenue growth in the first quarter, supported by 10% growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, reflecting double-digit gains across both U.S. and international markets, as well as solid gains in our Water and LPD businesses. Overall, organic revenue growth benefited by less than 1% from accelerated stocking orders in our Water and LPD businesses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through early March, global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains were trending very strongly, above the high end of our full-year goals for 11% to 12% organic growth. We were also tracking towards an excellent instrument placement quarter driven by continued momentum in new and competitive catalysts placements globally. These gains were against a backdrop of improved market trends, reflected in 4% same-store growth in U.S. clinical visits through this period. As social distancing policies advanced more broadly in Europe and the U.S. through March and as vet clinics adapted to prioritize health care procedures to align with industry and government guidelines, we saw significant declines in clinical visit activity and restriction on access to vet clinics, which moderated our Q1 revenue gains. Despite these impacts, our business momentum enabled strong overall Q1 organic revenue growth across our modalities. Global Reference Lab revenues increased 9%, reflecting 8% organic gains and approximately 2% growth benefit from acquisitions, offset by a 1% FX headwind. Through early March, Global Lab organic growth rates were excellent, driven by continued mid teen organic revenue growth in the U.S. and high single-digit gains in international markets. For Q1 overall, late quarter social distancing impacts constrained U.S. lab organic growth to high single-digit rates and international lab organic growth to the low-to-mid single-digit range. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 14% on an organic basis, despite late quarter COVID-19 impacts, reflecting low double-digit gains in the U.S. and mid-teen growth in international markets. Our consumable revenue growth results through early March were also very strong benefiting from an expanded premium instrument installed base, sustained high levels of customer retention and continued gains in testing utilization. The quality of CAG instrument placements remained high in Q1 reflected in 238 catalysts placements at new and competitive accounts in North America and 698 new and competitive placements in international markets. We also benefited from 273 second catalyst placements driven by momentum with North American customers. These gains and sustained high customer retention levels supported a 17% year-on-year growth in our global catalyst install base. We also achieved 760 premium hematology placements and 408 SediVue placements bringing our global SediVue install base to over 9300 instruments, up 32% year-on-year. Restriction on access to vet clinics in late March led to deferrals of quarter-end in placements, however, which contributed to year-on-year instrument organic revenue declines of 16% overall in the first quarter. Rapid Assay revenues increased 6% organically in Q1 despite late quarter COVID-19 impacts supported by solid volume growth in SNAP 4Dx Plus first-generation and specialty products and moderate net price gains. First quarter results reflected normal promotional and customer stocking activity, which supported volume gains ahead of the peak testing season. In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues achieved 11% organic growth, supported by continued strong gains in recurring service revenues, as well as sustained solid sales of new Cornerstone and digital imaging systems, and strong growth in our Neo and SmartFlow cloud-based software offerings. Overall gains were also constrained by COVID-19 related impacts on vet clinics late in Q1, which led to a deferral of new software and digital system installations. Turning to our other business segments, we saw a strong performance in our Water and LPD businesses in Q1. Water revenues increased 15% organically, including an estimated $2 million or 8% growth rate benefit from accelerated stocking orders. Overall, our Water business demand has remained solid globally as drinking water testing remains an essential service and priority for local governments and utilities. Livestock, poultry, and dairy revenue increased 12% organically in Q1, including approximately $3 million or 9% of growth rate benefit from accelerated stocking orders. LPD results benefited for demand for -- from demand for diagnostic testing programs for African swine fever and improvement in core swine testing volumes in China. We are also seeing continued solid growth for poultry testing. Overall LPD gains were constrained in Q1 by lower herd health screening levels compared to strong prior year results impacted by the rebuilding of herd populations in key Asia-Pacific markets, which is reducing export supply. Livestock diagnostics are also considered essential services supporting continued demand for LPD products. Turning to the P&L, profit results were strong in Q1 benefiting from solid revenue gains and controlled operating expense growth. Operating profit in Q1 increased 8% as reported and 11% on a constant currency basis, driven by solid operating profit growth across our CAG Water and LPD segments. Operating margins increased approximately 30 basis points on a constant currency basis, reflecting operating expense leverage on strong revenue gains. Gross profit increased 8% as reported or 10% on a constant currency basis in Q1. Gross margins were relatively flat year-on-year on a constant currency basis, as benefits from strong Consumable and Water growth and continued moderate net price gains were offset by relatively lower margins in our Reference Lab business, reflecting late quarter pressure on lab revenues related to COVID-19 impacts, lab capacity investments advanced in 2019 and effects from the integration of the Marshfield acquisition. Operating expenses in Q1 increased 9% as reported and on a constant currency basis. Operating expense increases were driven by cost related to the expansion of our Global CAG commercial capability advanced in 2019 and growth in corporate, general, and administrative costs, including the on-boarding of our Westbrook Maine headquarters expansion. During the quarter, we benefited from early efforts to prioritize investments and controlled discretionary spending to mitigate emerging COVID-19 impacts. EPS in Q1 was a $1.29 per share including tax benefits of $6.6 million or $0.08 per share related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable constant currency basis, EPS increased 13%. Overall, we are pleased to have delivered strong financial results in Q1, despite late quarter headwinds related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Let\u2019s now spend some time discussing how social distancing policies and associated restrictions on business activity are impacting veterinary clinic visits and our CAG business in the near-term. Clinical visits have been impacted significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic through the implementation of social distancing protocols, as well as the industry guidelines for the prioritization of sick patient and emergency procedures at vet clinics. These dynamics can be seen in U.S. vet clinic tracking data, which is shown in the earnings snapshot on our IR website. We have added weekly tracking data for 2020 clinical visits extended through the week ended April 24th in the snapshot, as well as detail for wellness and non-wellness visits. As shown in this data, for the first quarter through early March on a same-store basis, clinical visits were up approximately 4% in the U.S., a solid improvement from 2019 trends. As social distancing procedures expanded in March, we saw a sharp correction in these trends, with same-store U.S. clinical visits declining approximately 25% for the weeks ended March 27th through April 10th with 15% to 20% year-on-year declines in sick patient visits and 35% to 40% declines in wellness visits during this period. We saw similar dynamics in European markets with more significant declines in severely impacted regions like Italy and Spain, as well as markets which implemented more restrictive stay-at-home policies like the U.K. In addition to this clinical visit data, we have been monitoring rolling weekly averages for chemistry slide run volumes and Rapid Assay runs through our global smart service connectivity, as well as rolling weekly trends for accession volumes in our Reference Labs. In the late March through the early to mid April period, we saw meaningful pressure on diagnostic testing levels associated with the restrictions on veterinary clinical activity. These initial impacts were relatively more significant in our Reference Lab and Rapid Assay businesses with average weekly volume declines of approximately 30% in the U.S. and approximately 35% in Europe during this period, with more moderate impacts in Asia-Pacific markets. Testing volume in these modalities were impacted in part by the de-emphasis of wellness testing at clinics as part of the pandemic response, consistent with industry guidelines. VetLab in clinic chemistry run volumes to relatively less effective during this initial period reflected an approximately 20% run declines in the U.S. and 25% declines in Europe. These metrics reflected lower test utilization levels, as well as moderate reduction in the number of clinics actively operating during this initial high impact period. Over the last two weeks, we have seen significant improvement in clinical visit and diagnostic testing trends. These changes reinforced the high resilience of demand for companion animal health care and may indicate that we work through the bottom of near-term COVID-19 effects on veterinary care. For the most recent week ended April 24th, overall U.S. clinical visits declines have moderated to 15% year-on-year with only 9% year-on-year declines for sick patient visits and 24% year-on-year declines for wellness visits, with steady improvement across U.S. regions week by week. We are seeing similar indications of improvement in European markets and in Asian regions which were impacted at an earlier stage by the pandemic. In terms of our business, we continue to see pressure on diagnostic testing levels. However, these impacts have improved meaningfully. In the U.S. and Europe on a rolling seven-day basis, IDEXX VetLab chemistry run declines have now moderated to approximately 5% year-on-year and Reference Lab accession volume declines have moderated to 10% to 15% overall, with continued steady weekly improvement across regions. Chemistry slide runs in leading-edge markets like China have actually returned to double-digit growth over the last eight weeks following the significant initial impacts on clinical activity. These changes vary by region may change depending on region specific dynamics related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but overall recent trends have been very encouraging. As we track data on COVID-19 related impacts over time, some insights are emerging. One insight is that most veterinary practices have sustained operations as an essential service through this initial high social distancing period positioning the market for a strong recovery. In the U.S., our tracking of the number of customers doing chemistry runs only declined to about 90% to 95% of prior year levels during the peak pressure period in early April and has now returned to prior levels over the last two weeks. Active customer tracking metrics have also rebounded strongly in Europe where we saw more meaningful reduction in active clinic levels earlier in the COVID-19 expansion in lockdown regions like Italy and Spain. We are seeing the same structural market strength in Asia-Pacific regions as well. The second insight is that the effects on diagnostic testing levels appear to be heavily influenced by the stage of development of COVID-19 case management and the associated stage of stay at home and social distancing procedures. There is a significant variation in the level of decline in diagnostic testing volumes by region. Regions with higher relative COVID-19 cases and expanded lockdown policies have experienced much more significant clinical visit and diagnostic testing volume declines. As an example, clinical visits in the Northeast U.S. declined approximately 35% in late March to mid April, while Southern U.S. regions decline approximately 20% during this period with more recent data from Southern U.S. region showing year-on-year declines of less than 10% overall. Internationally, near-term pressure and lab accession volumes in regions like Germany have been much more moderate compared to markets with extended lockdown conditions like the U.K. and Canada. In Asia-Pacific markets, we are also seeing moderated impact in regions that are farther along in terms of managing pandemic effects, including recent solid growth in the IDEXX Lab chemistry runs in markets like Australia, which has less restrictive social distancing controls. This is dynamic we will continue to monitor and which is challenging to predict. Overall, it does appear that as regions move past peak levels for COVID-19 cases and adjust stay at home and social distancing procedures, near-term pressures on clinical visit activity and related diagnostic testing lessen significantly. While we remain very optimistic about the health care market and IDEXX\u2019s ongoing growth opportunity reinforced by recent encouraging trends, COVID-19 pandemic effects will pressure our near-term revenue results. Given the high gross margin of our IDEXX VetLab and Rapid Assay products and our intent to sustain our Reference Lab operating and service capability to position ourselves for recovery in demand as market restrictions are lifted, we anticipate a high level of gross margin flow through impact from near-term CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue pressures. To mitigate these impacts, we have advanced prudent steps to reduce planned operating expenses by approximately $25 million on a quarterly basis compared to the original plan levels. This includes temporary reductions in salaries of 30% for the CEO, 20% for officers and senior executives, and 10% for the majority of other salaried employees, which we plan to cease over time as business conditions improve, as well as temporary freezing of 401(k) matching contributions and suspension of cash compensation for IDEXX\u2019s is Board of Directors Our balance sheet is in a very strong position and we have taken additional steps to strengthen our liquidity and flexibility to advance our business strategy and market position during this period. We ended Q1 with leverage ratios of 1.70 times gross and 1.59 times net of cash, with $81 million in cash and $360 million in capacity available on our then $850 million revolving credit facility. In April we increase committed financing availability by $350 million by expanding our credit facility to $1 billion under new three-year agreement and by issuing 200 million of 10-year 2.5% fixed rate notes. In the current environment where prior to funding of our business operations and have suspended our stock repurchase program. Overall, we are very pleased with the strong momentum demonstrated in our business in Q1. We have got a great business model and we are confident we can manage effectively through near-term impacts from COVID-19 in our CAG business, while positioning ourselves for a strong recovery in the highly attractive and resilient Companion Animal Health Care. That concludes our financial review. I will now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Jay Mazelsky : Thank you, Brian, for your comments on Q1 financial performance. We are pleased with our solid Q1 results despite late quarter impacts from the COVID-19 crisis. We went into the year with strong momentum and through early March, global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains were trending above the high end of our full-year goals for 11% to 12% organic growth. We were still able to deliver 10 percentage points CAG Diagnostics recurring organic growth in Q1, supported by double-digit growth in the U.S. and international in spite of impacts from China in the early part of the quarter, from Italy in early March, and then for much of Europe and North America shortly thereafter. Instrument placements were excellent in Q1 resulting in sustained year over year levels of Catalyst EBI. Our catalyst installed base grew 10% in North America and 25% internationally with the overall premium instrument installed base increasing 15%. We developed a new remote installation process for instruments, which also supported placements in impacted regions. The IDEXX Preventive Care program enrollments also achieved record levels with approximately 400 new enrollees and more than 4,200 cumulative enrollments since program inception. This was accomplished despite late quarter impacts from COVID-19. Customers continue to embrace the IDEXX Preventive Care turnkey solution in record numbers and increasingly view it as a foundational element of their care offering. Though we expect in some cases for implementation to take a bit longer due to COVID-19 impacts, the IDEXX Preventive Care program will be a key element of what we and our customers see as a recover-together plan for North America. Our product innovations announced at VMX were launched on schedule and were enthusiastically greeted by customers. Our digital cytology placements starting in early March were primarily sold to larger IDEXX customers via our IDEXX 360 program. Customers are enthusiastic about our test promise, results, and expert interpretation in under two hours, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Catalyst Bile Acids with Reference Lab quality performance was also launched in the quarter. We are pleased with the adoption to date with over 340 customers. SediVue Neural Network 5.0 updates began rolling out in March and advanced bacteria detection kits starting to ship in April. Our innovation highlights also included the announcement in Q1 that we would begin monitoring clinically symptomatic pets for COVID-19 infection. We then announced in April that we would offer this test commercially throughout the world based on a small number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in cats, experiments that demonstrated the susceptibility of cats and ferrets, and veterinarian demands for testing option. We expect this veterinary test to not have an impact on human COVID-19 testing or test availability. Additionally, the company\u2019s human health business OPTI Medical Systems is advancing support of human COVID-19 testing with a validated PCR test kit enabled by IDEXX\u2019s expertise in livestock PCR, test development and manufacturing. It is intended for limited initial distribution to existing customers, including labs serving animal production needs that have been repurposed for human COVID-19 testing. Moving to software, we saw excellent ongoing momentum in our software business, which I will speak to later, with over 10% growth in PIMS placements in North America, record orders for SmartFlow and with now over 4,800 customers on Web PACS subscriptions. Moving to a quick update on our European core lab located in Kornwestheim, Germany. We have begun testing and it remains on track to transition by the end of Q2. We are excited by the world-class capabilities in this facility, which is 50% larger than our next biggest lab will bring to our European Reference Lab customers. Our team has done an amazing job to stay on track despite the pandemic. Finally, our Water and Livestock, Poultry and Dairy businesses, both performed solidly in Q1. Demand for livestock diagnostics testing is also considered essential and we are seeing sustained solid demand in our LPD business. Brian highlighted some of the dynamics we are seeing in the market and our testing volumes from COVID-19. Next I will discuss how we are managing in this environment, helping our customers and positioning ourselves for the future. Let\u2019s start with how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the IDEXX workplace and employee safety. Approximately 60% of our employees are now working from home. We have invested heavily and in telephony and IT infrastructure over many years, so that we were able to transition a majority of our employees home without missing a beat. Still other jobs require employees to be on site like those in manufacturing, distribution and the Reference Labs. We have instituted practices at these locations to minimize risk like staggered shifts or frequent and deeper cleaning and local social distancing procedures. Our teams continue to stay highly engaged and productive. Not only have we launched products on schedule, like the previously mentioned digital cytology service, Catalyst Bile Acids and advanced bacteria detection for SediVue, but we continue to advance our product pipeline, as our teams are adapting to the new circumstances in highly creative ways. Moving to how veterinary practices are being impacted. They are experiencing similar challenges as other businesses based on client visits. The good news is that veterinary practice has been designated as essential businesses throughout the U.S. and in almost all countries. The vast majority are open and operating, and we are still performing essential services for their clients caring for sick and injured pets in need of attention. Demand for other services, including wellness visits and elective activities have slowed due to government policies and guidance from veterinary organizations designed to control COVID-19 spread. Though our veterinary customers are consequently seeing fewer patient visits at this point, volumes impacted are in line with the aggressiveness of social distancing procedures. Many services are only deferred, and we believe we will return relatively quickly as in past downturns once the recovery begins. We believe the bond between people and their companion animal family members is as strong as ever. As Brian noted, we have seen dampened demand relatively more in our Reference Lab business versus testing in the clinic. This is related in part to fewer preventive care visits versus those involving a sick patient. Further, practices like all businesses are also concerned with workplace and employee safety. They have instituted practices like curbside drop off and pickup, remote check in and bill pay, along with the creation of modified shifts for veterinary staff to ensure care team well-being and continuity for clients. Our field service organization has played an important role helping customers make these required adjustments to their practice workflow in this new COVID-19 environment. IDEXX sales professionals have also adjusted well to this dynamic, continuing to generate demand for our products and services. Virtual visits than our standard can be highly sophisticated. Our sales professionals are using tools like WebEx for demos and DocuSign to bring pipeline deals across the line. We also continue to visit practices when requested by a customer and with an appointment, abiding by necessary safety procedures. Our in-person availability has been welcomed by customers and in April, constituted about 25% of total U.S. visits. Veterinarians look to business partners at all times, but even more so now to have sufficient product supply on hand and be able to supply services like Reference Lab testing in an uninterrupted manner. They want to focus on their businesses and now that their partners can handle theirs. IDEXX has performed exceptionally well in this regard and we have high confidence that we can continue to do so in the future. Our manufacturing operations are largely based in the U.S. and we have excellent visibility to secondary suppliers for key components and products that we do not directly manufacture. Our Reference Lab performance has been especially noteworthy in light of the disrupted flight schedules, challenging logistics and more complex workplace procedures to keep lab employee safe. With over 80 labs worldwide, not unexpectedly, there have been a handful of instances where it needed to temporarily shut a facility for a short time due to an employee being or suspected of being infectious. Because of our network lab capability across regions and geographies, we were able to seamlessly toggle to an alternative lab without service disruption or deterioration. These capabilities are unique in the industry and only possible because we have made significant investments over a very long period of time in lab density, common lab\u2019s information management systems, and courier route and logistics capability. We also deployed a global lab digital cytology service in the middle of all of this, another example of global agility and advantage. Our commercial execution also continues to be noteworthy. Our expansion in the U.S. was completed going into Q1 and the team seamlessly settled into the new territories and account assignments. Our account managers continue to call on customers with similar frequency, but now the majority of visits are virtual. Our European commercial team continues to mature in the VDC model and is also performing at a high level. We entered into the year with record customer loyalty across modalities and all actions taken to date have been taken with the long-term view to continue to earn this loyalty for years to come. IDEXX veterinary software and services are also playing an important customer enabling role in this pandemic. Right now, customers are being forced to rethink how they deliver patient care, and IDEXX\u2019s software solutions both new and existing to help them adapt. The IDEXX telehealth offering includes a multiple third-party -- includes multiple third-party telehealth integrations into our global PIMS offering, 90-day free secure remote access for our Cornerstone customers, the ability to use SmartFlow through an iPad from their parking lot for curbside check-in, and contactless payment processing integrated with their IDEXX PIMS. These capabilities enable customers to deliver remote care, as well as continue to see patients in their practices while abiding by social distancing guidelines. We also believe that in the medium term, telehealth can expand demand for diagnostics, the deeper pet owner client connections enabled by real time, convenient communications that millennial pet owners expect and pet owners of all ages appreciate. Further, telehealth has a potential to expand patient access, especially for cats, who comprise only approximately 20% of practice visits today. Next, I will share a snapshot view of the health of the business. There are broad macroeconomic uncertainties as to the depth and length of the impacts from COVID-19. Consequently, our focus has been on what we can control in our plans for recovery. We took quick and deliberate action to prudently control costs, while leaving us well-positioned for future growth. These include a temporary salary reduction, reductions in our essential business and capital expenses and a cessation of stock buybacks. Our intent is to seize those reductions that are temporary like salary reductions as conditions improve. Critically, these actions were taken in ways that allow us to preserve the considerable strategic advantages, talent and organizational engagement we have as a company. Our financial strength has allowed us to support veterinarians at a time when they need us most, and I believe they will reward our approach with their business long into the future. We have taken practical actions which extend payment terms for customers who need it, as well as to provide near term flexibility for minimum commitments, while maintaining these long-term diagnostic partnership agreements with customers. Customers have given us and will continue to give us as much testing volume as possible. Our focus is therefore to support the health of their practices and allow them to focus on delivering excellent medical care in a challenging environment and when the time comes, support them as they quickly rebuild client traffic. We participate in great markets. Nothing has changed in this regard due to COVID-19 social distancing practices that have temporarily limited veterinary visits. If anything, pet owners have become even more attached to their companions as they spend even more time with them at home. Pet adoptions and fostering at an all-time high and breeders in many instances report waiting list of 12 or more months. And most importantly, pets still need to go to the veterinarian and most pet owners do not consider these visits to be discretionary. Diagnostics will continue to play a central and growing role in the care of the patient, as well as practice health. Many practices have seen accelerating impact from e-tailers gains in online sales of food and medicine. This is business that is not likely to come back at the same levels. Veterinarians will continue to look for practice categories like diagnostics that are medically necessary, drive the care envelope and almost always best done in the practice. Our belief is that as a result of pent-up demand from COVID-19, which has constrained care that is desired and needed, though perhaps not time critical, veterinary practices might experience a stronger V-shape recovery than the vast majority of other market segments. We see some early evidence of this in select markets like China and Australia and regions within the U.S. where these markets have begun to relax strict shelter at home policies. Practices will be in good shape to meaningfully take up where they left off, though they have reduced hours and furloughed employees in some instances, we believe that there isn\u2019t structural damage to the industry or the balance sheet of practice owners. As practices rebuild client traffic with a focus on wellness care, we will be there with our strategic advantages fully impact. We are using this time wisely, continuing to advance our product pipeline, strengthen relationships and provide exceptional day-to-day service. Unique capabilities that we bring are now even more widely appreciated and keep in mind that this is a highly resilient business with a history of outperforming in economic recovery periods. While these are difficult times, they are an important reminder of our company purpose and that what we do makes a big difference in the lives of pets, people and livestock. I would like to express my deep appreciation and thanks to the team for their extraordinary support during this period. Now, we will take questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will be from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Go ahead please. Michael Ryskin : Thanks for taking the questions guys. I want to talk about some of the stuff you just touched on Jay, the cost cuts and the salary reductions you implemented earlier in the quarter. Can you talk us through the rationale of that move? It seem like it happen a little bit sooner and was more significant than initially expected. You talked about the V-shaped recovery and the sharp rebound and yet those are some of the meaningful cuts. Is there any concern that you could see increased employee turnover potentially to some of your competitors as a result of this and what criteria are you using to determine when you are with some of these measures, given the improvements you have noted and some end market. Jay Mazelsky : Sure. I will cover some of the high level, high level thinking and philosophy behind us and then Brian may want to talk through some of the specifics in terms of how we were thinking about that. We have a great business. We have a great organization. We really approach shifts with the idea that we want to, that we are going to come out of this that we are going to come out of this strong with the market. The pet owners love their pets that they believe that taking their pets to that veterinarians and getting testing is the right thing to do. We know that the veterinarians believe that testing is good medicine and uncovers disease. And so we wanted to approach this in a way that allows us to maintain all of our strategic advantages. These are advantages that we have built up, not just a year or two, but over decades. If you take a look at the Reference Lab for example, 80 plus Reference Labs, common labs, information management systems, courier route, service levels that are exceptional including weekends. We don\u2019t want to lose any of that capability. We don\u2019t want to -- we want to be able to continue to execute our product roadmap, maintain high engagement in the organization, continue to deliver exceptional service levels, make sure that we have supply when customers need it. And most importantly, if you take a look at our customer facing organizations maintaining full staff levels and being able to continue to serve customers is even more importantly. So we did this in a way that we think it was prudent that maintains engagement that the organization understands and responded to positively and so that as we come out of this, all of these strategic advantages, organizational capability, and engagement remain intact. So, Brian do you want to address that. Brian McKeon : Yeah. I think, we -- as I mentioned in some of the, the commentary we provided early on in this, I think the stay at home policies and that were being implemented late March, very early April where we are seeing significant impacts and we didn\u2019t have clarity on how that might evolve and thought it was prudent to get out in front of that. And as Jay highlighted, we had a goal of protecting employment and trying to find ways to mitigate what we were expecting in terms of some near-term impacts without damaging our underlying ability to advance our business strategy or serve customers. And I think the intent was to cease those cuts when it made sense, I think we are very encouraged by the recent trends. It\u2019s improving significantly day by day. And so I think we will keep an eye on this, but I think that was, that was the intent, the changes were implemented at a time where I think the, the depth of the impact from the social distancing policies was more significant. Operator : Our next question will be from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Go ahead. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. Are you seeing any sort of changes in the competitive landscape at this point? Can you take advantage of any competitor disruption on either at the point of care side of the business or Reference Lab, given that you can withstand this sort of volatility to be a little bit more nimble in this environment? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Thanks for the question, Erin. Yeah. We have always said that our markets that have historically been very competitive. It\u2019s no different now, even if it\u2019s within the COVID-19 environment. They continue to be very competitive. We are very pleased with the way -- with the inroads that we continue to make in terms of, if you take a look at the competitive catalyst placements globally, we were up 17% premium installed base year-over-year, 15%. We continue to expand Reference Lab testing. The point-of-care solutions like VetLab have held up relatively well in the COVID-19 environment. Now part of that is due to the fact that they support more sick patient testing with real time results. If you take a look at the Reference Lab for example, before the COVID-19 impact, we were at a solid middle teens in the U.S. from a growth standpoint, high single-digits internationally. So we did see some drop-off in volume in line with the visits and prioritizing case management, as Brian described it. But we have also seen even now, with the drop-off and the beginnings of a recovery that customers have a new appreciation, a far deeper appreciation for what we are bringing in terms of service levels, lab network, density, courier, logistics, all of those things. And I think what they are seeing from some other participants in the marketplace is they don\u2019t have that capability in that footprint to be able to provide that level of service. Erin Wright : Okay. Great. And then can you remind us of the sustainability of pricing across your business in prior economic downturns? And can you also speak to how minimum purchase agreements associated with consumables are impacted from the COVID disruption as well? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. So from -- in Q1, we continue to realize modest price realization of between 2% and 3%. Relative to future pricing dynamics, we are certainly not going to forecast that today. The thing that I would point out is that customers don\u2019t just think about price per se. They look at price within the context of overall value from what they get. We are always pressure testing the economics within that value construct. In terms of actually the programs themselves, we do have volume. We do have volume-based commercial programs and in some cases we are making allowances for rebalancing obligations where programs, just I think reflect the reality that there is some reduced client traffic in testing volumes and what to be able to support our customers through that. Operator : And our next question will be from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Go ahead. Jon Block : Thanks guys. Good morning. Maybe for Jay or Brian, is there a way to think about how much sort of loss versus deferred revenue. In other words, you are growth has been so consistent and durable every year around 10% to 12% organic. If the growth just to throw out a number is up low-single digits this year, when we think about 2021, can we sort of go back to that 10% to 12% off of that low single-digit number or is there a chance for, call it, a big acceleration mid-teens growth as we think about the deferred coming back? And I think that is just an important area that everyone is trying to get their arms around. I\u2019m defaulting to lost revenue because an emergency would have occurred and I don\u2019t think you do to wellness is in 1H \u201821, but maybe if you can go ahead and talk to that? That would be helpful. Brian McKeon : Yeah. I think, as you point out, Jon, it\u2019s a little difficult to estimate at the moment. I think our feeling is that there will be a level of pent-up demand here for care that will come back as people are able to access vet clinics. It\u2019s likely there is a level of kind of sick patient care that is just going to be lost in terms of the impacts at this time and it is just until we kind of work through this, and going to get back to what we think is going to be a rebound to a good place in terms of the industry\u2019s health. It\u2019s a little tough to project that out, which is why we are moving away from guidance at the moment. But I think the under -- we feel the underlying fundamentals of the industry are very sound. We think that working through the dynamics with our customers will only reinforce these advantages that we have as a business, and I think, we will be very well positioned to grow as we come out of this. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. I will share with you, Jon, a couple of things we are hearing from veterinarians. Let me focus on and well this that because to your point, if the patient is sick and or needs a surgery, they have obviously still have the opportunity to do that. If you take at look at Q1, we had a record number of preventive care enrollments in the first quarter, 400. So, that puts the overall program at 4,200 to-date, as I indicated earlier. But the important thing about preventative care, just as a category, is pet owners see that as something that\u2019s not discretionary, something that they truly prioritize for their pet. And more and more what practice owners in veterinarians are telling us is not only do they consider this is good medicine because it uncovers more and drives the care above. It\u2019s important to their practice economics. It is important to client engagement. So I see it from both the medical necessity and practice health standpoint. So, they are chomping at the bit. That speaks to what Brian had indicated, where we are relatively optimistic around sort of this pent-up demand and more of a V-shaped recovery. It\u2019s part of our -- it\u2019s going to be part of our recovery strategy, Recover Together strategy to emphasize that. There\u2019s still tons of work to do on sick patient testing in addition to preventative care. So we are relatively optimistic. Jon Block : Okay. And Jay, maybe just a follow-up on that last point. The one thing that we are hearing about COVID-19 is just the change of workflow within the practice, curbside pickup sort of spacing out the visits more. At the end of the day, it is reducing the overall number of visits, just from a workflow perspective and I think it\u2019s unclear how long this hangs around, right. How it plays out over time. So you talk about this V-shape recovery, but do you have any concerns that this altered workflow as a lasting impact sort of which results in a more protractive return to normal for the industry? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. I mean just that -- just a couple of observations. Yeah. The first couple of weeks, veterinary practices, they may struggle to adapt workflow. I mean, partly it was drop off in visits, but partly as you describe it, the extent -- they had to extend appointment blocks, and it was more challenging for them. That we worked with customers through our field service organization to be able to help them design new workflows in terms of curbside drop off and pick up, and remote check in and contactless payment processes. They have gotten much better at it, just like you would expect that over time you begin to optimize your processes. So, different states, different regions are in different stages of recovery and so initially it was only from the parking lot. I think over time, we will see that relaxation. Yeah, there is a point that I would make just tying together your two questions is that when you take a look at what\u2019s happened within the practices, with the e-tailers and a lot of product sales, both food and medicines going online. The -- a lot of that business is not going to return at least at the same levels that they experienced before. That\u2019s going to put even more focus on getting the patient into the practice, having checkups using diagnostics. So, again, we will see how this develops over time, but I think all the trends are positive. Jon Block : Okay. Thanks for the color, guys. Operator : We have a question in queue from the line of Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Go ahead. Ryan Daniels : Yeah, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Jay, can you talk a little bit more about Recover Together. It sounds like you have developed specific blueprint for kind of the bounce back. So I\u2019m curious what that involves and how your marketing that. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s really comes out with the fact that, even within this COVID-19 environment, we are still highly engaged with our customers. Our customer facing folks are our visiting customers 75% just take the U.S. for example is virtual, but 25% when requested were present and fully decked out and its safety care. So there is a high level of engagement. We are building pipeline. We are working with -- our customers in terms of developing strategies that as we recover they rebuild client traffic. We saw coming out of the great recession in 2009 that a lot of really good our clients or pet owners returned almost immediately. Where the veterinarian\u2019s I think need it needed some help and assistance is for those relatively new clients to help build the muscle memory of semi-annual or annual visits. So we are looking at programs that we have for example our preventive care program is perfect for that. And even the sick patient visits are allowed are advised, there are still some things that people are likely pet owners and likely deferring. So we are looking at all of our programs to be able to support that. Just one word on the IDEXX 360, because it\u2019s really tailor-made for this type of environment. Yeah, if you think about IDEXX 360 you are able to get capital purchases with zero money down. So if you are veterinary practice if you are in this constrained environment from an economic standpoint, you can still purchase instruments and you pay on a monthly basis and you are able to match invoicing to the customer with testing volumes. So in some ways it\u2019s really tailor-made to test for this type of environment. So we are looking at all of those things in terms of how to support customers. Ryan Daniels : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then a little bit more color on OPTI Medical. I know that doesn\u2019t get a lot of airtime, an acquisition you did to benefit the companion animal business. But what\u2019s the potential for that if you get FDA approval and kind of how will that process go. I assume you will have a distribution partner for that in the human market, any color there? Thanks guys. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. So we have developed and validated a human real-time PCR test for COVID-19 and really to your question, we leveraged the capability we have in OPTI, which is our human health business from a regulatory standpoint and channels, but also our experience in developing and manufacturing livestock infectious disease kits in our current business. So this is a test, it is a PCR test. It is highly effective in terms of sensitivity and specificity from a performance standpoint. Results -- you typically get results in well under four hours, so it\u2019s fairly quick, and we have used, OPTI is used or is in a process of using the FDA\u2019s Emergency Use Authorization process. We are waiting for approval, as well as we have applied for CE Mark in the European Union. And so we are advancing our ability to manufacture these in our Livestock, Poultry, and Dairy business, and really targeting for initial distribution existing IDEXX customers. So not necessarily using external channel, so these include things like livestock, laboratories, public health laboratory, state CDC labs, stuff entities like that. Operator : Our next question, we will go to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead. Nathan Rich : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I guess to start, I think, Jay you mentioned, vet services are tended to be pretty resilient during past downturns and obviously consumers are going to be facing kind of uncertain economic conditions coming out of this. I guess I\u2019d be curious just, when you look at wellness visit in recent weeks, I mean has there been any change in metrics like the percentage of those visits that include blood work, the number of test orders that might provide an indication of the consumer\u2019s ability to spend on diagnostics for their pets? Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. So let me -- I will answer that question in a couple of levels, because you had mentioned the recessionary environment and the resilience of the business, which is absolutely true. When you take a look at the great recession in 2009, we performed extremely well growing 5%, coming out of the trough of that and if you now, we say, 10 years later, we are even I think better positioned to be able to perform strongly in a V-shaped recovery. So you think about the business as a whole. we are extremely well diversified, geography across businesses like CAG, Water, livestock, poultry and dairy across different modalities and plus lots of shapes. So just a couple of things that I would emphasis, which includes our commercial organization with, if you take a look at a decade ago, we were represented primarily through distributors and now we have more direct representation and so we are not reliant on others. I think the fact that our portfolio is far broader and includes sick and some of the wellness pieces that you emphasized. And I think the role of diagnostics is far more appreciated and how important it is and really how it feeds into not only good medical care but practice health. In terms of the component of diagnostics over the recent couple of weeks and what that looks like. Not sure we have visibility to that data yet. That\u2019s something that we will continue to look at on a weekly basis in terms of both lab accessions as well as the smart service, what the testing piece is, but still too early to comment specifically on that question. Brian McKeon : Yeah. I would highlight, I think the, as we are looking at this data day by day literally, it\u2019s very encouraging to see how quickly it\u2019s coming back. So, I think, it\u2019s -- we think that\u2019s reinforcing the willingness that we have seen for a long time of the pet owners spend on critical care and that for their what is now a member of the family, I think this was even more powerful than it was over 10 years ago when the last great recession. So early indications are we are very encouraged by and those areas we will continue to monitor. Nathan Rich : Great. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up, as you have seen restrictions start to ease in some areas, have you also seen kind of reps visits pick back up, I\u2019m just curious to know if there could maybe be more prolonged impact there. Is that\u2019s kind of one of limit the number of sales reps that they see in the clinic, just due to the concerns around COVID? Jay Mazelsky : I\u2019m sorry, I missed that part where you said the number of what visits pick back. Nathan Rich : Well, I\u2019m sorry. Yeah. Have your sales reps, I guess, been able to start to go, call on customers in areas where restrictions have eased and could that have a more prolonged impact on -- which is their ability to kind of get back in and see customers. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. Okay. I got it. Absolutely. The way we conduct visits today is when customers ask us to be present or that differs than a lot of other companies out there that have essentially 100% virtual visit policy. So if you take a look at April, for example, 25% of the visits of the field organization was actually physically visiting the practice. Now, if you break that down by states and regions, it did differ based on the how strict the social distancing procedures were in the practice. What we saw in places like Texas and the South relatively more visits, relatively higher visit levels in terms of clients and more testing. Impacted - higher impacted regions like the Northeast and the Great Lakes, for example, a bit lower. So, very much in line and proportional to what the local guidelines are per se per region. Nathan Rich : Thank you. Operator : We have a question in queue from the line of David Westenberg. Just one moment please while we open his line. David Westenberg : All right. Thank you for taking the questions. So I\u2019m just a layer on some of the questions that have already been asked. Can you talk about your balance sheet right now, some of the rationale between taking on the additional debt. Is that at all sense, can we expect at the practice level, maybe there is some liquidity needs, and right now it\u2019s your opportunity to help those practices that need to preserve cash? And then, just related to that, do you think that they are going to be more likely to avoid the cash flow and sign the contract or do you think there might actually be some hesitancy on that contract? And then as a follow-up on the near term, can you quantify the pent-up demand. I know VCA used to say in their practice, they have an 80% recovery rate in a snowstorm kind of environment of those appointments. Is that a good way to think about it in terms of when social distancing ends and I will take these questions offline? Thank you. Brian McKeon : Thanks, David. Just on your balance sheet question. I think we have some of the work out and we highlighted was in flight before the pandemic really started impacting the business. We were in the process of securing some of the terminal financing at low rates and we are able to execute that effectively in our revolver -- was up for renegotiation this year regardless. So I think we just advanced that and we are able to extend it and actually upsize it. And I think we, we were in an excellent position. We are in an even better position. And I think you raised a very good point. It enables us to continue to be highly supportive of our customers, and we are helping independent practices in the U.S. and Europe with some payment term dynamics in the near-term and trying to be as helpful as we can. As Jay mentioned, I think, our programs are very well suited to helping people through if they have near-term concerns about cash flow management to continue to advance their businesses and we will continue to be leaning in on that front and helping practices in ways that makes sense for us all to move back to normal over time together. Jay Mazelsky : I mean, I would just also again reemphasize the IDEXX 360 program is ideal in many respects for new customer acquisition and its environment. No cash outlays matching customer invoices with the use of consumables. And the other thing David is we are able to calibrate future commitment expectations for customers in terms of how we use this. So, I think, we all recognize that this is a unique environment and we can highly configure these type of volume commitment programs for that environment. David Westenberg : And then if I could just get on that the recovery rate, if there is any way to quantify like if VCA\u2019s 80% recovery on weather related thing that used to give five years ago when they were public, but\u2026 Brian McKeon : We don\u2019t have benchmarks like that. I\u2019m not sure snowstorm is the best analogy at the moment. This is -- it\u2019s very dynamic region by region, but I think as a theme, we are very encouraged by how quickly we see demand coming back as policies are less restrictive and we are optimistic about how this will play out over time. David Westenberg : Thank you. Operator : We will go next to the line of Andrew Cooper with Raymond James. Go ahead please. Andrew Cooper : Hey, everybody. Thanks for the questions. A lot is uncovered. So I will maybe just ask one kind of attacking something a little bit differently. But as we think about the transition to virtual visits and obviously you are still doing a number of in-person, but when we think about installs, you have done a lot of second instruments and things like that as a portion of your growth. When we think about demand for that, obviously, it\u2019s a little bit different than sort of a net new competitive placement, but how do we think about exiting when clinics aren\u2019t necessarily seeing the same volumes that they were? Does that delay that need or potentially our clinics that are well capitalized sitting there saying, hey, we can get an installing without really disrupting as busy of a day where we are kind of working at full capacity as it is. Any comment there just kind of on the pace of instrument installations would be great as you come out of this. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. Let me -- yeah. There is a couple of questions in that. Let me just address the question around or the point you made around second catalyst placements at practices. These tend to go to higher volume customers. So it\u2019s not like we are placing a second catalysts and it\u2019s just sitting there. I mean, the reason they may want a second catalyst as they are growing their practice, growing client visits. It is a highly modular system. So this represents a real volume driven decision on the part of customers. We think from a recovery standpoint, as well as longer term trends. The diagnostics utilization will continue to be robust for sick patient, preventive care, menu offering our product roadmap and the different assays we are launching continue to drive, continue to drive usage, continue to drive utilization, though it\u2019s somewhat lower now because of this environment. We think that all the dynamics and all sort of the value drivers are still intact. So we don\u2019t expect through the recovery for that to change. Brian McKeon : We have time for one more question. Andrew Cooper : I will stop there if anybody else is in the queue. Thank you. Operator : That will come from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Go ahead please. Michael Ryskin : Hey, guys. Thanks. I think I dropped off the initial one. Thanks for the follow-up. Just real quick, I want to go back to some of my concern sort of longer term about the vet dynamic. As we think through this impact sort of what\u2019s forefront of my mind is that, that\u2019s going to be economically challenged here in potentially for an extended period of time. Both from economic recession and potentially some, some tail risk here in terms of volumes. So how do you think about vets being a little bit more price sensitive around their offerings and we know that IDEXX is definitely the premium brand in the space in terms of pricing compared to Heska and Abaxis and the cheaper alternatives. Are you concerned that would be while diagnostics utilization overall and visits made holding pretty well due to the economic challenges and some of the pressures on them, they may trade down to some of the cheaper offerings? Jay Mazelsky : So here\u2019s I would -- here\u2019s how at least we think about it, Mike. Customers have always been concerned with the economics of the solution. I mean that hasn\u2019t changed. Price is a component of it. The value that we deliver is the other component of it. And as I indicated, we are always testing to make sure that the value and economics line up. From a customer standpoint, what we work to do through our programs is to make sure that based on their environment and based on the circumstances, we provide the appropriate program that allows them to purchase what they think are the best tools and allow them to deliver the best medicine. From that standpoint, nothing has changed in terms of our solutions and what they perceive to be the best solutions for their needs. And as I indicated, we have programs that allow them to get that, get the products, get the service offerings they want and do it in a way that works for them, works from an economic standpoint and matches and aligns the invoices that they collect or charge to the client and what they have to in turn pay us. So we are confident that we can continue to meet their dates and do it in a way that\u2019s economically sensitive to the environment. Michael Ryskin : Great. Thanks so much. Jay Mazelsky : And with that, I want to thank everybody for calling in. I know we have some employees who are also on the call and I\u2019d like to express my gratitude for their extraordinary performance there in these unsettling times. We run the company in a way that both delivers the day and takes a long-term view designed to maintain and grow the strategic advantages of our business. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the IDEXX team and the purpose, which animates our work. And so with that, we will conclude the call. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Event Teleconferencing. You may now disconnect.",

Participating in the call this morning are Jay Mazelsky, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian McKeon, Chief Financial Officer; and John Ravis, Senior Director, Investor Relations. IDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements. Listeners are reminded that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the forward-looking statements notice in our press release issued this morning, as well as in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website idexx.com. During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. In reviewing our second quarter 2020 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth, constant currency growth, and comparable constant currency growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2019, unless otherwise noted. To allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit his or her questions to one with one follow-up if necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions. So, please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we\u2019ll take your additional question. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon Brian McKeon : Good morning everyone. IDEXX delivered excellent financial results in the second quarter. We benefited from a V-shaped recovery and our CAG business and flow through profit benefits from favorable product mix and discipline cost controls. In terms of highlights, revenue increased 3% as reported and 4% organically supported by 7% growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. Following a period of significant pressure on CAG diagnostic testing volumes in late March through mid-April, we saw a sharp recovery in market demand for diagnostics globally in the second quarter, including very high growth levels in June, supported by pent-up demand for wellness and non-wellness testing. Better than expected CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth and benefits from proactive cost controls drove a 410 basis point improvement in constant currency operating margins in the quarter. This enabled delivery of $1.72 in early earnings per share, an increase of 23% on a comparable constant currency basis. For the first half of 2020, we delivered an EPS of $3.01, up 18% on a comparable constant currency basis despite headwinds related to the COVID pandemic. As we'll discuss solid pet healthcare market growth trends have continued in July, pointing to a foundation for continued solid revenue growth for our core CAG business. We're also well-positioned in terms of our financial management approach, aligned with our goal to deliver operating profit gains at or above the rate of revenue growth in the second half of 2020. While we're very encouraged by recent market trends and our ability to manage through the COVID pandemic effectively, we recognize the potential future effects related to the pandemic may be dynamic and challenging to project. As such, we will not be providing specific financial guidance for 2020 at this time. Let's begin with a review of our second quarter revenue results and recent market trends. Second quarter organic revenue growth of 4% was driven by 7% organic gains in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues in both U.S. and international markets. Our overall revenue growth also benefited by 1% from our OPTI human PCR test initiative. These gains offset impacts related to the pandemic, which reduced new IDEXX VetLab and digital instrument placements, and pressured non-compliance water testing. We also saw impacts from the reversal of March stocking orders and our water and LPD businesses, which reduced Q2 revenues by 4.5 million or less than 1%. As noted, our overall performance was driven by growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues, which strengthened considerably through Q2. By month, CAG diagnostic recurring revenues declined approximately 16% in April, increased 8% in May, and grew an impressive 30% in June, supported by strong gains across our major modalities. Consistent solid revenue trends were seen across our major regions, reflecting the global strength and resilience of the veterinary healthcare market. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains were aided by a rebound in clinical visits as demonstrated in our same store U.S. weekly tracking data, published in our earnings snapshot available on our website. Following an 18% contraction in clinical visits in April, same-store clinical visits amounted to plus 2% in May and plus 7% in June, resulting in a 3% overall decline for the quarter. Early quarter pressure on testing was greater in wellness visits, which were down 5% for the quarter overall, but rebounded strongly in May and June. Non-wellness visits which we estimate drive about 75% of U.S. diagnostics revenue were down only 1% on the same basis in Q2. Clinical visit activity outpaced overall vet practice visit activity in the second quarter, as business mix of veterinary clinics has shifted towards more service based offerings. These dynamics supported a solid 2.5% increase in overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q2, despite a 5% decline in overall visits to clinics in the quarter. We're very encouraged by the broad market recovery. These solid trends have continued in July reflected in gains of 6%, and U.S. same store clinical visits through the first three weeks ended July 17, with solid growth now reflected across major U.S. regions. Please note that there is some latency in the reporting in the most recent weekly data, with these metrics continuing to improve as additional visit data is added over time. We believe the health and resilience of the global pet healthcare market is a positive factor that can support continued solid growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues in the second half of 2020. These improved market trends supported a strong recovery in IDEXX revenues in the quarter. By modality, IDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 7% in Q2, reflecting 6% organic gains and approximately 2% growth benefit from acquisitions offset by a 1% FX headwind. Results reflected high single digit gains in the U.S. and modest overall organic growth in international markets as strong gains in key regions like Germany, Japan, and Australia were offset by lockdown related impacts in the UK and Canada. IDEXX vet lab consumable revenues increased an impressive 13% on an organic basis despite early quarter pandemic related impacts, reflecting low-to-mid teen growth in both U.S. and international markets. Gains were supported by solid increases in testing utilization, sustained high customer retention levels, and continued expansion of our global premium installed base. As expected, CAG instrument placements were constrained in Q2 impacted by restrictions on sales access to veterinary clinics, and deferrals of new purchase decisions. This contributed to a 19 million or 40% year-on-year decline in reporting CAG instrument revenue in the quarter. The quality of CAG instrument placements remained high reflected in 165 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, and 536 new and competitive placements in international markets. We also benefited from 231 second catalyst placements, driven by momentum with North American customers. These new placements and sustained high customer retention levels supported a 16% year-on-year growth and our global catalyst installed base. We also achieved 545 premium hematology placements in 275 SediVue placements, bringing our global SediVue install base to over 9,500 instruments, up 25% year-on-year. As Jay will discuss our field sales forces, we\u2019d focus on rebuilding the new instrument pipeline globally as we gradually gain increased access to vet clinics. Rapid Assay revenues decreased 5% organically in Q2; primarily reflecting early quarter pandemic related volume pressure, as well as year-on-year dynamics related to promotional timing and activity. Consistent with our overall trends, Rapid Assay revenues showed a strong rebound from nearly 40% year-on-year revenue declines in April to nearly 30% year-on-your gains in June, supported by pent-up demand for wellness testing. Overall, CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume driven, with consistent net price gains of 2% to 3%. In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues declined 3% organically overall. Double digit gains and recurring service revenues were offset by declines in new veterinary software and diagnostic imaging system placements, reflecting pandemic related constraints on new sales activities. Turning to our other business segments following a 16% organic gain in our water business in Q1, we saw a 16% organic growth revenue decline in Q2. Second quarter results were impacted by the reversal of 2 million of accelerated stocking orders, reducing organic growth by 7%. The vast majority of our water testing volumes are compliance related or mandated by government regulations, and these volumes have sustained as an essential service, albeit with some disruption in early Q2 related to business lockdown effects, as well as beach and pool closures. Approximately 20% of our water revenues are from non-compliance testing related to areas like special projects, construction, and real estate transactions. We saw a greater than expected decline in this area related to reduced overall business activity and prioritization of lab spending. While we saw improvement in water revenue trends as we work through the quarter, we anticipate that non-compliance testing demand will be uneven in the near to moderate term, as public and private testing labs and public utilities adapt to pandemic related macro impacts. Livestock, poultry, and dairy revenue increased 2% overall in Q2, net of an estimated 2.5 million or 8% headwind related to the reversal of accelerated stocking orders. LPD results continue to benefit from a demand for diagnostic testing programs for African swine fever, an improvement in core swine testing volumes in China, supported by large producer efforts to rebuild swine herds. We're also seeing continued solid growth for poultry testing globally. Overall, LPD gains were moderated in Q2 as expected by lower herd health screening levels, compared to strong prior year results impacted by the rebuilding of bovine herd populations in key Asia Pacific markets, which is reducing export supply. Finally, as noted, IDEXX overall growth in Q2 benefited by approximately 1% from revenues associated with our [OPTI] and COVID-19 PCR test. This includes benefits from our initial test supply program with the state of Maine. We're extending these support efforts through the implementation of a lab based testing capability in partnership with the Maine CDC that will provide capacity for up to 350,000 human COVID tests over the next several months. We're continuing to focus on supporting COVID PCR testing globally leveraging the capabilities of our OPTI human and LPD businesses. We note that human PCR testing is a very dynamic area with shorter-term project commitments, and growing competition from alternative suppliers that make demand difficult to project. In addition to these efforts, we recently completed work to adapt our OPTI PCR test for use in wastewater samples, which will be offered to IDEXX water customers through our water commercial organization. We're very pleased to be leveraging the capability of IDEXX to contribute to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic globally. Turning to the P&L, profit results were very strong in Q2 benefiting from solid revenue gains favorable product mix, and proactive steps to manage costs in the context of the pandemic. These actions supported 380 basis point improvement in reported operating margins, or gains of 410 basis points on a constant currency basis, driving an increase in operating profits of 18% as reported and 20% on a constant currency basis. EPS was $1.72 per share, including benefits of 4.9 million or $0.06 per share related to share based compensation activity. On a comparable constant currency basis, EPS increased 23%. Gross profit increased 6% as reported or 8% on a constant currency basis in Q2. Gross margins increased 210 basis points on a constant currency basis supported by net mix benefits from strong consumable sales and lower instrument revenues, benefits from moderate net price gains, and solid productivity improvement in our lab operations supported by tight cost controls. In the second half of 2020, we'll see relative increases in our reference lab costs reflecting the on-boarding of our new German core laboratory. And as we add lab staffing to ensure high customer service levels globally in a growing market. Operating expenses in Q2 decreased 4% as reported and 2% on a constant currency basis. As noted on our last call, we advanced a targeted 25 million of quarterly operating expense reductions, compared to our original spending plans to mitigate potential impacts from the pandemic.  Benefits from these initiatives, as well as approximately $5 million in lower than expected health and dental costs were realized in the quarter. These efficiencies in combination with stronger than expected revenue growth enabled 200 basis points of positive operating expense leverage. Given the strong recovery in our business, we've discontinued temporary salary and benefit reductions, which yielded an estimated 13 million in savings in the second quarter. In the second half of 2020, we intend to advance targeted hiring and prioritize investments in supportive or long-term growth strategy, including augmentation of our international commercial capability while delivering solid operating profit gains at or above the rate of revenue growth. In terms of cash flow, we generated 236 million in positive cash flow year-to-date. On a trailing 12 month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 80% or 93% adjusted for our investments in our Westbrook headquarters expansion, and German lab relocation, which are now largely complete. Our balance sheet is in a very strong position enhanced by steps in Q2 to add to our liquidity and flexibility. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.4 times gross and 1.26 times net of cash with 105 million in cash and 877 million in capacity available on our expanded $1 billion revolving credit facility. We did not allocate capital to share repurchases in the quarter and it contend to continue prioritizing funding of our growth strategy and business operations this year. Overall, we're very pleased with strong momentum and level of operational execution demonstrated in our business in Q2. IDEXX is a great business model with tremendous long-term potential. We're very pleased to have managed through the first half of 2020 effectively, despite the pandemic impacts, and look forward to building on that progress. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Jay Mazelsky : Thank you, Brian, and good morning. Welcome to our Q2 earnings call. Today, we're pleased to report excellent Q2 results supported by a sharp global recovery in the pet healthcare market. As Brian noted in Q2, we delivered 4% overall organic growth and a 7% increase in CAG diagnostics recurring revenues, despite significant early quarter headwinds related to stay at home policies. We've managed well the initial impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and we've seen a strong and sustained recovery in our core companion animal health business that is highly encouraging and reinforces our optimism and the long-term growth potential of our business. Proactive cost discipline allowed us to deliver strong profit gains, while ensuring ongoing investment in our innovation programs, a high level of continued service for our customers, and investments in the health and safety of our employees. This strong level of performance reflects IDEXX\u2019s extraordinary resilience. It gives us confidence in our ability to sustain solid growth and financial results as we manage through the ongoing dynamics associated with the pandemic. Let me start with a brief update on our supply chain performance, market trends, observations on how our customers are adapting, and the success of our commercial organization and engaging customers to support the recovery of the market. IDEXX has applied veterinary practices in an uninterrupted fashion with point-of-care diagnostic products and services like reference lab testing, and we have high confidence that we can continue to do so in the future.  Our manufacturing operations which are largely based in the U.S. have excellent visibility to secondary suppliers for key components and products that we do not directly manufacture. Our reference lab performance has also been especially noteworthy, in light of disrupted in challenging logistics more complex workplace procedures to keep lab employees safe. Our network lab capability enables us to seamlessly toggle to an alternative lab without service disruption in the event of a COVID-19 infection. These capabilities are possible through significant investments that have been made over a long period of time, in lab density, common lab information management systems, and courier route of logistics capability. Not having to worry about service or product availability, our customers have been able to focus on their mission of caring for patients and have been highly resilient through the pandemic. They have now expanded the breadth of services provided from the early COVID-19 focus on sick and emergency patient services.  As Brian noted, despite an overall 5% decline in the same practice visit levels and Q2, vet clinics were able to increase in-practice revenues by 2.5%, supported by an increased emphasis of medical services enabled by diagnostics testing. Customers have adapted to new ways of delivering service, such as an increased use of telehealth and curbside checking where the pet owner remains in a car during the appointment. Staff from veterinary clinics have indicated that this has increased their comfort level with recommending more comprehensive and clinically relevant diagnostics with support from pet owners. Veterinarian\u2019s also say that they are increasingly focused on delivering core medical services for their patients, as a result of the substitution of product sales to e-retailers, which have accelerated. To treat, veterinarians have to first diagnose and IDEXX\u2019s proprietary diagnostics are a key tool in advancing the standard of care. Supported by these trends, we've seen solid improvement in both wellness and non-wellness visits with additional acceleration of wellness visits more recently reflecting in-part pent-up demand. The proportion of clinical visits, including at least one diagnostic has increased since March in both wellness and-non wellness visits. In addition, we're seeing greater dollars of diagnostic revenue per clinical visit. Overall, the average diagnostic revenue per clinical visit in 2020 that included at least one diagnostic has been trending above previous years levels as well, approximately 5% higher for the first half of 2020 versus the first half of 2019. In fact, diagnostics revenue per critical visit overall, and per non-wellness visit has been higher than in 2019 every month this year. We're also seeing evidence of increased interest in pivot ownership through the pandemic, including among current pet owners, another indication of the strengthening of the pet human bond. These improvement trends are global and have sustained in early Q3, as evidenced by continued solid U.S. clinical growth trends, albeit at moderated levels from the extraordinary growth rates seen in June. We are monitoring the evolution of the pandemic and associated management of infection rate growth across regions, which may impact future demand. We remain encouraged by the solid global recovery in demand in our core CAG business supported by an ever growing pet owner bond. Our commercial execution also continues to be noteworthy. We\u2019re very pleased with the effectiveness of our global commercial team during a period with a very challenging market backdrop. Field occupancy remains in the high 90s and customers appreciate that the cadence and level of our field visits, whether they are physical or virtual in nature are at very high levels. Our global teams also showed tremendous agility in supporting our customers during this period, including designing and implementing a new remote instrument install and training process, which enabled us to successfully onboard new customers in a safe and effective way when requested. Some of these new processes enabled us to place over 1,800 premium instruments globally in a quarter, including over 1,000 catalyst placements, with over 700 in new and competitive accounts. Our field service representatives continue to be welcomed by veterinary practices, and we've seen an increase in in-person visits by our customer account managers up to 40% in June, versus the 25% we saw in April for the U.S. While pandemic related factors have constrained CAG instrument placements, as well as new software system implementations and pressure new digital imaging system sales, we expect the pace of capital placements to gradually improve over the balance of the year. Our field teams have used this time to build pipelines in the rate in which this improvement occurs will be related to ongoing improvement to VDC access to veterinary practices and to hire practice owner confidence that will inevitably come with an economic recovery. As Brian noted, moving forward, we will be augmenting our commercial presence internationally. Our approach will be to add resources selectively on a rolling basis in targeted markets, leveraging the capabilities of our new global commercial model, which we look forward to discussing more at our upcoming Investor Day. We're encouraged by the resilience of the companion animal market, and believe there is a significant long-term opportunity to increase standards of care globally supported by our direct commercial capability. As we support customers, we're working to continue to advance programs that support a higher level of care, such as preventive care, we saw continued adoption of the IDEXX preventive care program with over 100 new enrollees in a quarter supported by the strong recovery and market demand for veterinary services and robust wellness visits traffic, bringing our total enrolled practice level to 4,300. As expected, our Q2 additions were reduced from prior quarters as this is a program that requires broad practice access to onboard and train a large number of staff. Customers continue to embrace the IDEXX Preventive Care approach and consider it a foundational element of their care offering as they look to uncover more with IDEXX proprietary diagnostics. Growing enrollment and engagement in the IDEXX Preventive Care program is a key focus for our commercial team in the second half of the year in our recover together initiative. As we support continued market recovery, we also continue to advance our new product initiatives introduced at VMX in January. Through capital placements have experienced some near-term headwinds in the second quarter as a result of restricted practice access, digital cytology is experiencing strong customer interest. With our sophisticated information management systems and clinical pathology experts around the globe, we were able to provide results very often in well under the two hour commitment, allowing veterinarians to provide close to real time cytology professional services. Our technology for life philosophy, as represented by the introduction of Bile Acids in our IDEXX vet lab instrumentation suite has also been received with strong enthusiasm. Bile Acids reflects the eighth parameter introduced in catalyst over the last eight years. We are pleased with the breadth of global adoption to date as about a 1,000 customers across 35 countries have now utilized Bile Acids on catalyst with reference on a quality performance. As noted on the last call, our SediVue advanced bacteria detection kits started to ship in April, and over 750 customers have now utilized the kit. Detecting bacteria in urine is a key driver of clinical value. And we are confident that this enhanced capability will drive an even greater appreciation for and testing with the SediVue platform. In addition to keeping innovations on track, as Brian discussed, we brought new COVID-19 test to market for both animals and people by leveraging core technical and manufacturing capability. We also continue to advance our operating capability. We're excited \u2013 very excited and have completed the move into our new European core lab located in Kornwestheim, Germany. There are now houses over 500 employees with state of the art capabilities and automation.  Our Kornwestheim facility will enable us to further optimize our lab network in Europe, expand service levels and bring improved efficiency, while supporting our continued growth for years to come. Kornwestheim is now the largest lab in our global network. And the dedication and perseverance of our team made it possible to bring this lab online in the middle of a pandemic. Moving to our VSS business, although we face some headwinds related to new software and diagnostic imaging system placements as access to veterinary practices was impacted by COVID-19, we had excellent double-digit growth in our recurring service revenues, supported by the expansion of our customers subscription base for cloud solutions like Web PACS, SmartFlow, and Neo to highlight a few applications. We also saw hundreds of customers take advantage of integrated software solutions like secure remote access in telehealth that help practices, manage their business in this environment. We continue to strengthen our leadership and global execution and software, and are excited to announce the addition Michael Schreck as Corporate Vice President and General Manager, IDEXX veterinary software and services reporting to me. Michael has over 20 years of experience in industry leading software and technology. He has global responsibility for our customer facing software business, and will work closely with our global CAG commercial team to advanced software solutions to support more efficient workflows, and practice management, improved patient care, and value-added services that drive the overall health of veterinary practices. The health and safety of our workforce and their families and our communities continue to be a top priority for us. Though we have begun to bring back a small number of employees engaged product development with their benefits on site access, the majority of IDEXX employees continued to work remotely, and travel remains highly restricted. We are providing spending allowance for many of our remote workers to help them maintain a health and safety work environment outside of our facilities. I'm especially appreciative of our employees around the world whose role required them to work on-site during these last several months, in order to provide essential services to our customers. Health and safety procedures continue to advance for on-site employees in addition to physical distancing and PPE now also include daily temperature checks in many locations.  Given improved market and business trends, we're happy to share that we've discontinued temporary reductions in employee salary and benefits. In light of the recovery in market demand, we are adding resources to critical areas like manufacturing and live operations to ensure we can support market demand and customer service levels moving forward. Our teams continue to stay highly engaged and productive. Our 2020 media employee engagement survey showed an all-time high employee engagement level for the organization during a period in which a global pandemic has created significant business and personal challenges for our employees. Overall, we're very encouraged by the strong recovery in our business. The resilience of our industry and IDEXX\u2019s business in particular is extraordinary. We're positioning ourselves to support sustained market growth, while delivering solid financial performance as we continue to advance our long-term strategy. In this context, I would be remiss, if I didn't take the opportunity to thank both our employees and customers. Our customers continue to provide medical services against the backdrop of economic uncertainties, and new challenging workplace and employee safety requirements. As many of us, including the pet owners, we couldn't be more appreciative. And a huge thank you to my IDEXX colleagues around the world for their tremendous efforts in continuing to support these customers and our business. I\u2019m very proud of what we accomplished this past quarter. In closing, we're looking forward to our first ever virtual Investor Day on Thursday, August 13. We will share updates on our long-term opportunity, strategic priorities, and financial goals. You can now register for the event on the investor relations section of our website. Participating in the event will be members of my senior management team, including Brian McKeon, CFO; Tina Hunt, General Manager for Point of Care Diagnostics and Worldwide Operations; Michael Lane, General Manager of Reference Labs and Information Technology; Jim Polewaczyk, the Chief Commercial Officer. And that concludes my opening remarks. We now have time for some questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question on the line comes from Mr. Michael Ryskin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Michael Ryskin : Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Brian, Jay, I want to start with, you know, your comments clearly indicate that conditions improved throughout June and July, and your snapshot data and a lot of other third party data indicates that right now, we're at a run rate that's, you know, in-line with, if not above prior year trends. I'm just curious given the improved trends we've seen in recent months, what factors went into the decision to not reissue guide? Is there any additional uncertainty you're anticipating? Is it tied to some, you know, potentially economic sensitivity later in the year, could you just, you know, give us an insight into [indiscernible]? And I have a follow-up. Brian McKeon : Well, as you know, I think we're very encouraged by the trends in the business and our execution. The decision to continue to suspend guidance is not reflective of a lack of optimism for the business. I think it's more just reflective of its \u2013 continues to be a dynamic. You can see 30% growth in the business in June, you know, we have, you know, some dynamics that continue to evolve, and we're gaining more experience in insight as we work through this. We're planning for solid revenue and profit growth in the near-term. We've got the same long-term outlook for our business. We see the same potential, and I think the strength of the business during the pandemic's reinforcing that potential. So, we're feeling good about the business, but we'd like to gain more experience with some of the dynamics before we start updating the specific projections. Michael Ryskin : Appreciate the color. A quick follow-up exactly on that [poll], the strength in June, July, and you had some comments of, you expect that some of this could have been pent-up demand from April, you know, from late March, April downturn. Any color, you could give us any way to parse that apart? Because obviously, you know, the 30%, recurring CAG in June is clearly above any prior level of performance. So, anything you do to sort of give us a sense of what the underlying demand levels are right now? Jay Mazelsky : Sure. I mean, we do think as we indicated that some of this is due to pent-up demand, both from the wellness and non-wellness side. I mean, we also think that there's a potential change in the delivery of care, which is both driving visits to the practice and in higher diagnostics. And let me just expand on that through the lens of both the pet owner and the veterinarian.  So, if you if you think about the pet owner ,we\u2019re all spending significantly more time with our pets as we work from home. We're observing more issues, you know, could be very simple things like limping, scratching, lesions. So, I think being more attuned to our pet and their activities, certainly, pet owners are bringing their pets to the practices both catch up, as well as observing new things. And then from the [indiscernible] dimension, we believe that if anything COVID-19 has continued to support and potentially accelerated the focus of medical services, now part of that may be to, due to, they've seen product sales, move to e-retailers as practices were close, or access, you know, somewhat restricted. And when you focus on medical services, as I indicated, to treat you first have to diagnose, and so diagnostics plays a really key role there. We've also heard from veterinarians that they are recommending in some cases a higher standard of care when the owners dropping off the pet at the curbside. Some of the uncomfort or discomfort of the face-to-face conversations are easier to happen when you're talking to the pet owner remotely. And there may be some factors related to just that awareness of the need to provide a full care, if there's a second way or there's a recession down the road, so in the pets and the practice taking care of the pet to the full extent possible. So, all these things are playing in, and we'll have to see over time how they play out. Michael Ryskin : Yeah, [indiscernible]. Brian McKeon : Yeah. Mike, I think there's clearly some recent benefit from the pent-up demand, but the underlying market demand across our regions look solid. So, we're obviously monitoring that, but we feel very good about the underlying trends. Michael Ryskin : Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question online comes from Mr. Ryan Daniels from William Blair. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys. This is Nick [indiscernible] in for Ryan. I guess just to start off, there's been a lot of talk and data out there about how new puppies have been growing, people have been going to adopt new pets, because their working at home. I was just wondering, would you kind of define that more as being a pull forward? I.e. like people were planning on getting pets originally, and just now they're working from home, they just thought that this was a good time, or do you view it more as an incremental increase in pet ownership? Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, so we haven't seen hard data out there that quantifies the dynamic between adoptions and fostering. And you have to factor in all the puts and takes, but there's a lot of anecdotal evidence that was just, you know, adoptions from breeders, as well as fostering is up. And we've seen a number of different reports looking at the different dimensions of drivers. So, you know, I think it's reasonable to assume there is benefit from that, but over time, we'll watch some better data behind that. Unidentified Analyst : Got you. [Indiscernible] And then I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on the decline in rapid assays this month. I wonder if there's any logic to why consumables would, you know, grow pretty healthily, but rapid assays decline or was that just like a function of a strong comp from last year? Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, there were a couple of things. We're pleased with the Rapid Assay business and the progress we continue to make in the assay business. Revenues did decline 5% organically in Q2 is primarily related to two things. One is, we were relatively more impacted in the early quarter piece of the pandemic impacted volume pressures. Keep in mind, a good portion of our Rapid Assay business is 4Dx and heartworm, which is more of a screening test. And the pandemic occurred right smack in the middle of a peak season. So clearly that was impacted. And then there were some year-on-year dynamics related to promotional timing activity. In 2019, we had a two decent sized promotionals. So the compare was a bit more challenging. We don't believe it's a competitive issue when you take a look at a couple things; one is, unique customers and new unique customers were modestly above where we were. So, we're happy with the way the business is progressing. And then if you take a look more at the sick patient testing piece of the portfolio, so these are [indiscernible] like Parvo and Giardia, as well as CPL and FPL, you know, those were pretty healthy. So, we've pretty much pinpointed it to both the promotional compare, as well as where the pandemic fell, relative to the peak season. Brian McKeon : And as I highlighted the, in June it was up 30%. So, we're the same kind of [indiscernible] we've seen in other parts of the business. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Great. That\u2019s very helpful guys. Thanks. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question online comes from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Jay, maybe to start, you know, on the outlook, you obviously highlighted the strong visit growth continuing into July, you know, the proportion of visits that include diagnostic, you know, continues to go up, and that's kind of been a longer-term trend. You know, I think kind of going into the year, you know, you guys had kind of expected, you know, 11% to 12%, kind of CAG Dx recurring growth. I guess, if we see these end-market trends continue, and obviously, there's some uncertainty around that. I mean, is that the type of revenue run rate that we should expect the business to get back to over the back half of the year assuming that these market trends hold? Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. As Brian said, we\u2019re very encouraged by the strong recovery, you know, in the market, in business, and we think we're properly and appropriately positioning ourselves to be able to support that. And solid business growth as that develops, whether it's service levels or commercial capability, but, you know, they've given that the environment is still very dynamic, and it's challenging to project. You know, I'm just not going to go down the path of hypothesizing what that looks like. It's hard to predict what the future, you know, these type of COVID related restrictions are going to look like and how they play out. You know, though, as I said, we're very positive. I think we're very optimistic on the outlook and the resilience of the marketplace, but we\u2019ll have to see how all the puts and takes play out. Brian McKeon : I think as \u2013 it's early, but I think it\u2019s a longer-term trend. Some of the themes that Jay was reinforcing on the increased emphasis on services and comfort level with recommending more diagnostics we certainly think that that can be a positive factor for us, but, you know, in terms of our new to moderate-term outlook, I think there are a number of variables that we're gaining more experience with and we're planning for solid growth. That's our outlook. Nathan Rich : That's fair. And that kind of dovetails into my second question, the stat that you gave around kind of diagnostic revenue per visit up 5% year to date, obviously, kind of very good considering the backdrop, I guess, have you seen this accelerate at all, you know, as you know, COVID hit and, you know, is this a longer term, potentially tail that could be, you know, beneficial to the business, you know, kind of coming out of COVID? Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, so, you know, whenever veterinarians focus on medical services, we benefit from a diagnostic standpoint, and it drives to care envelope and they need to be able to characterize the condition of the patient to be able to treat the patient. And the only way or the best way that they do that is through diagnostic testing. So, that's certainly a very positive factor. The other positive factor is more in our control, and that\u2019s through innovation. As we continue to expand our menu, as we continue to expand the solutions and tools that we provide veterinarians, they test more. And then the third factor is obviously, creating awareness, education, and ultimately, more testing, and that's done through our field organization, our both professional service vets, as well as our account managers to VDCs. So, all those things come into play. I think it's a very positive story, in terms of, you know, those factors driving this engine of growth and diagnostics. Nathan Rich : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question in the line comes from Jon Block from Stifel. Please go ahead. Jon Block : Thanks, guys. Good morning, sort of a long first question, but over the past two to three years, IDEXX\u2019s CAG recurring growth premium has been about a thousand basis points to same store clinical visits. Let me see if I can make sense here. You know, for June, the premium was massive. It was on 2,300 basis points to 30% that you guys allude to in the release versus June up 7%. You guys in the release, and I think on the call talked about July same-store clinical visits up 6%, but how about the CAG recurring? I'm just curious if that massive CAG recurring premium remained elevated, you know and very wide and over 20% or did it start to tighten guys back to the historical, which is sort of closer to that 10% delta? Hopefully that made some sense. Brian McKeon : Yeah, Jon. I wanted to focus on the on the Q2 dynamic, but to your point, we we've typically grown at a very healthy premium. We look at it a few different ways, whether it be to clinical visits or things like PCE growth. And I think that even with the dynamics that went on earlier in the quarter the actual gap widened in Q2 versus historical levels somewhat. And so, we think that's very encouraging. We think it reinforces the themes that Jay was talking about, which is emphasis on services and some positive dynamics that may help us going forward.  We're not in a position to project our monthly revenues. What I would say is that, you know, the strong clinical visit trends that we're reinforcing and seeing globally, by the way, are indicative of solid momentum in our business overall. So, it's a, you know, it's a positive dynamic. We feel very good about that and look forward to building on those trends going forward. Jon Block : Okay, I think [to try to push you] a little bit Brian. I guess what I'm curious about is, you know for the overall quarter, I believe according to my math, the average premium wasn't too dissimilar than years past. It was around a thousand bips, but it was crazy, right. In April, the CAG recurring was down 16%, and so was the visit. So the premium was zero in the beginning of the quarter in April, and then 2,300 basis points as you exited in June, and I'm just trying to get a feel, you know, on a month by month basis, that it's a very big move. So as we went into July, I mean clearly you have the data, was it, you know, elevated at that 2,300? Or did it start to work its way and compress a little bit? That's just sort of what I'm trying to get at. Brian McKeon : Yeah, no, look, I think we're going to learn more as we go forward. We think we're \u2013 we obviously were surprised this was better than we expected. We knew it was a resilient business and thought we would recover quickly, but I think this has come back even stronger than we thought, and you know, we'll see how this plays out over time. There's a lot of dynamics going on in the near-term, there is some pent-up demand effect that that's going on, and perhaps some changes the way vets are delivering services that Jay highlighted. So, we'll learn more. Jon Block : Okay. And the second question is a little bit different, but hey, you know, you talked about some of the stuff we recently called out in our checks with work from home, resulting in pet owners to see more stuff for perceived issues and bringing their dogs and cats in the vet's office and, you know, as a result, they're running diagnostics. I mean, you also talked about curbside, you know, vets are uncomfortable selling so curbside just easier for them to push diagnostics, but, you know, those are arguably I think we all hope in some way are temporary and you know, when work from home eases, who knows, but going into 2021 and we're never going to remain curbside right? Hopefully people are going to go back into the best practice. How does that unfold? I guess what I'm trying to get at are these structural long-term changes in terms of tailwinds for diagnostics or do you see some of those benefits that you\u2019ve alluded to arguably unwinding over the next handful of months? Thanks, guys. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. I would just add a couple of observations. One, as I think as veterinarians recommend, let's say more of a full service approach, and pet owners are supportive of that. They often \u2013 that often go through a change themselves and say, okay, I've asked the pet owner for it, I thought they were kind of push back or maybe more budget minded than they were and in fact, they've been very receptive to us. So, I think what we often say and we see this in preventive care program is the whole process of helping the tenant or through that change management piece of bringing the pet in, and having this check that includes diagnostics is important both for the pet owner, as well as the veterinarian, and then, you know, the other thing that I would height, heighten or at least highlight is that, whatever the long-term citing or, you know whether people stay at home or if it's more of a hybrid type model or employees come back to work. You know, I think most experts who are looking at this believe that there will be more of a hybrid model where you have a combination of employees working from home and work. And I think that if anything, there will be, you know, that continued visibility to the pet health and strengthening of the human pet bond, which is, I think, good for the industry. Jon Block : Great, thanks Jay. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question online comes from David Westenberg from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. David Westenberg : Hi, and thank you for taking my question. I think investors have a pretty good sense of what's going on in the U.S. just getting the third party data, but I think Europe seems to be kind of a black box for a lot of investors. And, you know, you're a global company. So, I was hoping maybe you can just talk about European macro. And then you could probably use U.S. as kind of a benchmark in terms of what\u2019s relative to the U.S. because that is a question we get a lot and something that's pretty hard for us to understand in terms of macro and recovery. Brian McKeon : Sure. So just stepping back our CAG recurring Dx numbers, as we mentioned were up similar rates 7%, both in U.S. and internationally. Europe has, I think, overall seen similar strong recovery trends. I think there are some specific market dynamics. We've seen consistent, very solid growth in areas like Germany and in Southern Europe, particularly recovering from some of the significant lockdown or the fact that were seen in March and April. The UK lagged, that just having lockdown procedures in place for a longer period. And we noted that in terms of the lab growth was relatively lower than the U.S. but I think overall very similar dynamics V-shaped recovery, that clinics back online, very positive feedback on demand. And, you know, a little a little kind of an evolution of some of the markets, but as we as we speak, basically all the markets are back online. And, you know, we're feeling good about the growth outlook in that context. David Westenberg : Got you. And then maybe I'm jumping in front of your Analyst Day here, can you talk about contribution from maybe psychology and contribution from Bile Acids that the new product launches and where it's gone in growth maybe right now and where we anticipated growth in the future. I do know you give a similar kind of graph to that in your Analyst Day. So, if I ended up in front of that my apologies there and we can wait for a month for that. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, no, I'll just give you a quick, quick update and flavor of the two, two products you mentioned. You know, we're \u2013 as I had indicated, we're really pleased with the market reception to digital cytology. You know, we think that being able to provide the cytology services in under 2 hours, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, is truly transformational. We think if I just characterize the U.S. market, we're primarily targeting the higher cytology users. So these are customers who submit five plus cytology exams, you know, the experts, the pathology experts like we have, and we think that that represents about 5% of the overall marketplace. Just to give you another data point, we have about 6,000 customers, IDEXX customers who use our reference labs and also use our cytology services. So, we think that there's a pretty decent sized opportunity out there, that's going to take some time to develop, but you know, so far so good in terms of customer enthusiasm and market reception to the service. In terms of the Bile Acids question, the way we think about it is, each parameter that we introduce is important. It has a lot of value to customers, but it's the cumulative menu that I think has the most impact. In the case of catalysts, this is now our, a test. The one previous to that was progesterone. So it's being able to provide a menu where you don't need to have a new or separate instrument that it fits within the workflow and use model of, you know, our chemistry analyzer is really important. The particular test [requested] Bile Acids is very accurate as reference lab quality performance. And we were very pleased with the rate of adoption and the rate of awareness amongst our customer base, given that it's only been really a couple months, and we're in the middle of a pandemic, so that type of uptake is quite gratifying. David Westenberg : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question online comes from Andrew Cooper from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Andrew Cooper : Hey, thanks for the time. I guess starting with, maybe the P&L a little bit, you know, obviously, kind of an odd quarter with COVID, but good results, but as we look at the gross margin line, you know, is there anything you'd call out, obviously, you know, there's some costs that came out, you've got, you know, kind of a slew of things across gross margin and OpEx that you talked about, but is there anything in particular to call out on the gross margin line, in terms of, you know, really a very strong number, I think, the strongest we've maybe ever seen from you guys, so anything to point out there? Brian McKeon : A big part of that is mix. So, you know, just the strength of CAG recurring Dx and at the same time declines in the instrument revenues. So, you know that is definitely a factor in terms of the absolute number. We did benefit from cost control. So, we in late March, early April, when we saw the initial COVID impacts, we were very focused on making sure we can manage through that effectively. We were very tight on hiring and staffing. We ensured we had good service delivery, but that was a benefit as well. So, as we move forward, I think we \u2013 as we noted, we're going to be adding resources to make sure that we can support staffing. We're seeing some higher freight distribution costs, which I think is a broader kind of macro dynamic that's going on. And importantly, we'll have the German core lab coming online. So, we'll have some incremental costs there. So, that\u2019ll be \u2013 have some moderating effects, but you know, we're very pleased with the gross margin results. And it really reflects the health and kind of the high margin flow through of the recurring annuity of the IDEXX business. Andrew Cooper : Okay, great. And maybe just kind of a similar question on OpEx, obviously, you know, the 13 million coming back, you know, presumably at some point, the benefits cost in terms of dental and health care, you talked at, talked about at least normalizing, but you know, as we think at a high level, you know, about how COVID has changed how we behave, you know, you mentioned doing installations, remote and things like that, does this change how you think about some of those, you know, some of those line items on a more permanent basis in terms of, you know, real cost savings that you could drive, either, you know, that you hadn't thought of before, or potentially, I guess, just faster than maybe you would have planned otherwise, in terms of, you know, the overall sort of cost basis? Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, I mean, I think it has opened up everybody's eyes in different industries to things you can do more productively, or different. I think some of the examples we cited, like being able to firstly to partner with customers, whether it's through a sales process or remote installation, providing software tools, which allow them to do telehealth visits. You know, I think these things are certainly areas of focus that we can look at that will drive productivity. I think having a larger workforce without needing bricks and mortar, and being able to support remote employees, you know, in a productive fashion, I think, we're all finding that there's some, you know, that there's some benefits in doing that. I wouldn't quantify it at this point in terms of operating expense savings, but I work constantly as business leaders looking at how we can run the business differently and more productively while still supporting our customers. Andrew Cooper : Okay, great, and maybe one more kind of asking a question a different way than it's been asked so far, but when we think about that pent-up demand and backlog, do you have a sense for, you know, hey, it feels like a lot of what's come out, we've worked our way through and now all the visits that are being seen are kind of more on the steady run rate, or is there still some of that that pent up demand that you're feeling, you know, early in July, that potentially is whether it's elevated visits, you know, visit numbers themselves are elevated utilization within visits, because it's maybe been longer, you know, since that pet was last in the clinic, is there anything you can kind of point us to, you know to give us a little bit of a level set for where we sit, you know, entering July and into 3Q? Brian McKeon : I think there is, you know, still some pent-up demand effects going on. You could see that in the wellness visit growth, it was up 10% through the first three weeks. So, I think that is supporting that. And, you know, it's tough to calibrate. We grew 7% in Q2 that's, you know, below what we had normally grown. So, you know, that would indicate that we didn't make up some of the visits and so, you know, we're not in position yet to say what's, you know, where's this settling out if you will. You know, I think the underlying factors all look very positive. The industry looks healthy. Vet clinics are online. They're doing more service based work. Anecdotally, the feedback has all been really good and I think we're just, you know, seeing factors that reinforce the strong pet owner bond and willingness to spend on pets. So, you know, we're likely seeing some continued pent-up demand benefit, but I think the underlying trends look very, very healthy. Andrew Cooper : Great, I'll stop there. Appreciate the time. Brian McKeon : Thank you. Operator : Okay. I want to, with that\u2026 Brian McKeon : We were going to transition to conclude the call. Operator : Okay. Thank you. Jay Mazelsky : I want to thank everybody for calling in. I know we have some employees who are also on the call. And I just want to express my gratitude for their extraordinary performance during these unsettling times. We run the company in a way that takes a long-term view designed to maintain and grow the strategic advantages of our business while still delivering the day. I couldn't be more appreciative of the IDEXX team and the purpose, which animates our work. We look forward to meeting many virtually as part of our Investor Day program. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

To allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit his or her questions to one, with one follow up as necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions. Please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we will take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Good morning, everyone. IDEXX delivered excellent financial results in the third quarter, reflecting continued strong gains in our CAG business globally. In terms of highlights, revenue increased 19% as reported and 18% organically, supported by 21% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth was high throughout Q3, building on the strong global trends we saw in our CAG business in Q2. For Q3 year to date, CAG Diagnostics organic recurring revenue growth increased 12.8%, reflecting the extraordinary global resilience of demand for companion animal health care. Flow-through benefits from high recurring revenue growth drove a 470 basis point improvement in comparable constant currency operating margins in the quarter, enabling delivery of $1.69 in earnings per share, an increase of 47% on a comparable constant currency basis. In Q3 we recorded a $27.5 million or $0.24 per-share accrual related to an ongoing litigation matter. Our comparable constant currency operating margin improvement metrics and comparable constant currency EPS growth rates exclude impacts from this charge. For Q3 year-to-date, we delivered EPS of $4.70, up 28% on a comparable constant currency basis, supported by 10% organic revenue growth. We continue to be encouraged by robust CAG market trends, and we\u2019re planning for strong revenue growth and profit growth in our business moving forward aligned with our long-term goals. However, giving ongoing potential dynamics and uncertainty related to the pandemic, we will not be providing specific financial guidance for 2020 and 2021 at this time. As we\u2019ve done in recent quarters, we\u2019ll focus our review on the trends we\u2019re seeing in our markets and how we intend to manage our business effectively in this context. Let\u2019s begin with a review of our third quarter revenue results and recent market trends. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 18% was driven by 21% organic gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, reflecting 22% organic growth in the U.S. and 19% organic growth in international markets. Strong organic growth was also supported by 18% gains in our LPE business, driven by continued strong growth in Asian markets, as well as by approximately 1% of growth benefit from our OPTI human COVID-19 PCR test initiative. Overall gains were moderated by constraints on new IDEXX VetLab and diagnostic imaging instrument placements and moderate organic declines in water revenues, though trends on these fronts improved solidly compared to the second quarter. As noted, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains sustained at high levels through the third quarter reflected in approximately 24% organic growth in July, and growth of approximately 20% combined in August and September. CAG growth dynamics remained healthy across regions in Q3, led by very strong gains in the U.S., and high organic growth in other key markets such as Canada and Australia, aided by fulfillment of pent-up wellness demand. Revenue growth in Europe and other key Asia markets was also strong in the quarter, reinforcing the broad global recovery in our CAG business. For the year-to-date, CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth has increased 13% in the U.S. and 12% overall in international markets. High CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains continued to be aided by solid growth in clinical visits, as demonstrated in our same-store U.S. weekly tracking data published in our earnings snapshot, available on our website. Overall clinical growth sustained at 6% in Q3, supported by continued solid 3% growth in non-wellness visits and 11% growth in wellness visits including benefit from pent-up demand, which we estimate contributed 2% to 3% to overall clinical visit gains in the quarter. As Jay will discuss, a factor supporting clinical visit gains is an increase in first-time clinical patient visits, which we estimate added approximately 1% to overall clinical visit growth and 2% to wellness visit growth in the quarter. A continued focus on health care services supported an 11% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinic revenue in Q3, well ahead of 1% growth in overall visits to veterinary clinics in the quarter. IDEXX growth has been even stronger than these positive market trends, particularly in our U.S. core market where Q3 CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains exceeded 20%. A key metric we follow for the U.S. market is the premium of CAG recurring revenue growth to overall clinical visit growth. In recent years, this metric has increased steadily from a 7.5% growth premium in 2016 to a 9% premium in 2019, reflecting enhanced commercial capability, program initiatives and technology we\u2019ve been advancing to support the development of diagnostic testing. In 2020, we\u2019ve seen an acceleration of this trend. Year-to-date, the CAG Diagnostic growth premium to clinical visits has expanded to 12%, supported by a further acceleration in growth in Q3. These trends reflect an increased focus on services overall at the clinic level, which help drive growth in average Diagnostics revenue per visit to 6% for year-to-date compared to approximately 4% growth in recent years. These are encouraging trends that we\u2019re monitoring closely and Jay will discuss in more detail, which point to a strong ongoing market growth dynamic for our CAG business. This positive market backdrop supported high Q3 organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities. By modality, IDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 24% organically in Q3, led by more than 20% growth in the U.S. and mid-teen organic gains in international markets. Relatively higher U.S. gains are aligned with higher levels of wellness testing which has benefited recently from fulfillment of pent-up testing demand. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 22% on an organic basis, reflecting similar high levels of strong growth in U.S. and international markets. Gains were supported by solid increases in testing utilization across regions, improved very high customer retention levels, and continued expansion of our global premium install base. CAG instrument replacements recovered solidly in Q3, as sales access to veterinary clinics gradually increased and clinics look ahead to supporting strong growth in diagnostic testing. While improving from recent trends overall replacements continue to be constrained by a degree by restricted sales access to some clinics, as well as near-term clinic work focus on supporting high demand for their services. These factors contributed to a $3 million or 10% year-on-year decline in reported CAG instrument revenue for the quarter. The quality of CAG instrument placements remained high, reflected in 303 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America and 860 new and competitive placements in international markets. We also benefited from 372 second-catalyst placements, driven by momentum with North American customers. These new placements and high customer retention levels supported a 15% year-on-year growth on our global catalyst install base. We also achieved 978 premium hematology replacements and 495 SediVue placements, bringing our global SediVue install base to over 10,000 instruments, up 22% year-on-year. Rapid assay revenue increased 20% organically in Q3, driven by high growth in the U.S., supported by pent up demand for wellness testing. Q3 year to date rapid assay organic revenue growth was 6%, driven by continued solid volume gains for 4Dx and specialty testing. Overall CAG Diagnostic revenue growth remains primarily volume driven, with consistent net price gains of 2% to 3% growth. In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 4% organically overall. Double-digit gains in recurring service revenues and strong increases in new software system placements supported by the fulfillment of outstanding backlog orders were moderate by lower diagnostic imaging system placements compared to strong prior year levels. Turning to our other business segments. Water revenues declined 4% organically in Q3, impacted by pressures on noncompliance-related testing which represents about 20% of water revenues. As noted in our Q2 earnings call, the vast majority of our water testing volumes are compliance related or mandated by government regulations, and these volumes have sustained as an essential service. We expect uneven demand related to noncompliance testing to persist, as we continue to work through pandemic-related impacts. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenue increased 18% organically in Q3, driven by strong growth in our Asia-Pacific region. LPD results continued to benefit from strong demand for diagnostic testing programs for African swine fever and improvement in core swine testing volumes in China, supported by large producer efforts to rebuild swine herds. We\u2019re also seeing continued solid growth for poultry testing globally. These gains more than offset lower herd health screening levels compared to strong prior year results. We expect to see moderation in our LP growth rate moving forward as we begin to lap the benefits of our prior year expansion of our African swine fever testing programs. Turning to the P&L. Profit results were very strong in Q3, benefiting from high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains and favorable product mix as well as continued benefits from proactive cost management. These actions supported a 70 basis point improvement in reported operating margins, or gains of 470 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis, driving an increase in operating profits of 23% on a reported basis and 43% on a comparable constant currency basis. As noted earlier, we recorded a $27.5 million or $0.24 per-share charge related to an ongoing litigation matter which was recorded in G&A and is excluded from our comparable growth metrics. EPS was $1.69 per share, including benefits of $16 million or $0.18 per share related to share-based compensation activity, bringing year to date share compensation related benefits to a much higher than expected $27 million or $0.31 per share. As noted on a comparable constant currency basis, Q3 EPS increased 47%, adjusting for these benefits and the impact of the litigation. Gross profit increased 23% in Q3. Gross margins increased approximately 200 basis points on a constant currency basis, reflecting solid productivity improvement in our lab operations, supported by over 20% organic revenue growth as well as favorable net mix benefits from strong consumable sales and lower instrument revenues and benefits from moderate net price gains. Foreign exchange hedge impacts, which are recorded in gross profit reflected a $1 million loss in Q3 and $3 million of gains year-to-date. Recent FX rates would indicate a modest favorable year on year revenue growth rate impact for Q4 and 2021, with profit benefits mitigated by previously established hedged positions. Operating expenses in Q3 increased 22% on a reported base and 9% on a comparable constant currency basis, excluding impacts from the litigation accrual. Q3 operating expenses included a $10 million investment related to the funding of the newly established donor-advised fund, the IDEXX Foundation, which Jay will discuss in his comments. As noted in our last call, aligned with the strong recovery in global CAG demand, we\u2019re advancing targeted new hiring and prioritized investments in support of our long-term growth strategy, including augmentation of our international commercial capability. We also expect incremental R&D costs in Q4, as we advance final steps ahead of the ProCyte One launch and expect employee health care and dental cost claims to increase as individuals seek previously deferred health care. Overall, we anticipate sustaining a relatively higher rate of Op Ex growth moving forward as we support our solid growth trends. In terms of cash flow, we generated $336 million in positive free cash flow year to date. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 90% or 96% adjusted for our investments in our Westbrook headquarter expansion and German lab relocation which are now complete. Our balance sheet is in a very strong position, aided by the exceptional financial performance we saw in Q3, and the steps we took to enhance our liquidity and flexibility earlier in the year. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.2 times gross and 1 times net of cash, with $176 million in cash and no borrowing on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We did not allocate capital to share repurchases in the quarter. Given our strong business results and positive cash generation and our confidence in the strength of the CAG market recovery, we will be looking at reinitiating share repurchases in the future, aligned with maintaining a prudent capital structure. Overall, we\u2019re very pleased with the strong momentum and high level of operational execution demonstrated in our business in Q3. IDEXX continues to show that we have a great business model and an amazing market with tremendous resilience and long-term growth potential. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Jay Mazelsky : Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX delivered exceptional performance in Q3, driven by sustained strong underlying market trends in our global CAG business. High CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains were supported in part by pent up demand for health care services, as well as a continued overall shift towards a provision of more veterinary services. These services are often enabled by a higher use and intensity of diagnostics. Delivering excellent patient care is the key value proposition of veterinarians and to treat, they must first diagnosis. Proprietary IDEXX diagnostics place an important role in this paradigm. We\u2019ve continued to see a clear, V-shape recovery in Companion Animal health care and these trends point toward a potential sustained level of accelerated growth for diagnostics testing. Let me start with a brief update on our market trends, including observations on how our customers are adapting and review the exceptional execution of our commercial organization in engaging and supporting tell them. As Brian noted, we\u2019ve seen solid growth in same-store clinical visits in key markets like the U.S. as well as sustained, strong recovery in clinic demand across our international markets. The factors supporting these results has been pent up demand for pet health care, evidenced by 11% growth in wellness visits in Q3. We\u2019ve begun to see some moderation in these very high growth levels, while non-wellness visits, which we estimate account for approximately 60% of overall clinical visits and approximately 70% or more of related diagnostic revenues, continue to expand at a healthy 3% rate. Many pet owners, just like a significant number of IDEXX employees, continue to work from home and are spending significantly more time with their pets; were likely more attuned to their well-being, resulting in higher practice visits. These trends further reinforce the strong global recovery and health of our markets. As we work through the market recovery, additional factors are emerging, which have supported very high growth levels in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Veterinary clinics appear to be increasing their standard of care at an accelerated pace. Evidence of this can be seen in the average percentage of U.S. clinical visits that use diagnostics. This averaged approximately 45% in Q3 of 2019. While in Q3 of 2020, this metric was approximately 200 basis points higher. To put this higher step up in context, an average 50 basis point per year increase was more typical in recent years. Not only do more visits include diagnostics, but the intensity is measured by revenue, has also increased. Growth in average Diagnostics revenue per visit to the U.S. has increased to approximately 6% year to date compared to 4% growth in recent years. Pandemic workflow procedures like curbside drop-off and the desire to take more a comprehensive health care approach may be supporting these promising trends. Diagnostic revenue growth per practice continues to expand as a result of these factors. U.S. Companion Animal Diagnostics revenue growth per practice increased 10.5% in 2020 compared to approximately 7.5% over the last five years. This is despite slowing of clinical visits due to the pandemic to 1% year to date compared to a five-year average of 3%. Our expanded commercial presence and focus on supporting the vet practice with innovative technology and insight for practice development continues to drive these favorable dynamics at a steadily improving rate. While we may see some moderation in these trends moving forward, these healthy dynamics reinforce a potential long-term positive backdrop for Diagnostic\u2019s market growth. Increases in the use of diagnostic speak to the willingness of pet owners to prioritize care for the health and well-being of their family members even during times of economic uncertainty. It also reinforces the increasing role of services in the vet clinic business model, reflected in an accelerated shift in diagnostics as a percentage of practice revenues. U.S. Diagnostic revenues as a percentage of total practice revenue reached 16.3% in Q3, approximately 100 basis points above prior year levels and compared to an average 25 basis point increase in recent years. For vet clinics, diagnostic services are one of the most profitable areas in the practice, and these trends can help mitigate the impacts of accelerated migration of product sales to online channels. An additional emerging factor that appears to be supporting higher service and diagnostics growth is an increase in first-time clinical patients. Anecdotally, we\u2019ve all seen and heard about increased interest in adopting puppies and kittens during the pandemic. While this is a difficult area to measure, we are seeing a meaningful increase in first-time clinical visits in our market tracking data. Year-on-year growth in first-time clinical visits measured to our U.S. practice intelligence database has increased an average of 8% year to date with accelerated growth since April, compared to approximately 2% year-on-year growth in recent years. As Brian noted, we estimate that incremental new-patient growth added approximately 1% to clinical-visit growth in Q3 overall. In our own business, we\u2019ve seen a meaningful step up in the number of U.S. hospitals running progesterone tests in average run levels, reinforcing a potential increase in breeding activity. While it\u2019s early to project the potential impact from these trends, evidence is emerging that there is an accelerated increase in growth in the U.S. pet population. While we recognize the potential for future business disruption related to the pandemic, these very encouraging trends are reinforcing our confidence in the long-term potential for our CAG business. Our Commercial organization is at the center of enabling this market development. So next, I will highlight key developments in our Commercial agenda. Our Commercial execution in Q3 was excellent. We saw solid continued recovery in instrument placements in North America and in international regions with 3,173 premium instrument placements globally in the quarter, including 1,700 Catalyst placements, with close to 70% in new and competitive accounts. Access to practices continued to improve through Q3, with in-person visits by our customer-account managers now at approximately 50% in-person in the U.S., and approximately 60% in Q3 on average in Europe. While underlying market demand for diagnostics has remained strong, we expect that sales professionals\u2019 access to veterinary clinics will likely continued to be pressured as social distancing policies and measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 remain dynamic and continue to impact veterinary care. As highlighted during Investor Day, a key multiyear strategy is to scale our commercial footprint on a rolling basis in targeted international markets. These expansion efforts reflect a tremendous opportunity as two-thirds of the potential total addressable market over time will be outside the U.S. Leveraging the commercial playbook of best practices, we develop through multiple expansions in the U.S., our international expansion roadmap is tracking to plan. In Q3, we successfully launched programmatic efforts to essentially double our commercial footprint in two important European markets over the coming months. We expect to continue to make great progress on these initiatives through the remainder of the year, with all talent hired, trained and on-boarded by first-half of 2021. These efforts complement the strong commercial momentum resulting from investments made over the past several years in Europe. For example, our newly opened and now our largest reference lab in the world in Kornwestheim, Germany, is fully functional and providing differentiated menu and excellent service levels across Europe. Additionally, Hematology is a very important modality internationally. And the announcement of ProCyte One has been enthusiastically received by customers. Finally, customers across Europe have embraced our IDEXX 360 program which was configured to the unique needs of key markets in the region with over 50% of premium instruments placed in the quarter using IDEXX 360, a new high. The combination of innovations like ProCyte One, Kornwestheim and IDEXX 360, coupled with an expanded commercial footprint in select countries are key elements of our growth strategy. Growing enrollment and engagement in the IDEXX Preventive Care Program is key focus for our commercial and corporate accounts team in the second half of the year. Program results recovered in Q3 with strong adoption of the IDEXX Preventative Care Program with approximately 230 new enrollees in the quarter supported by sustained high wellness visits traffic. This brings our total enrolled practice level to over 4,500. Enrollments in the program approached pre-COVID levels in the latter part of the quarter, which is evidence that customers continue to embrace the IDEXX preventative care approach and consider it a foundational element of their care offering as they look to recover more with IDEXX proprietary diagnostics Another prioritized area of ongoing focus is supporting customers with integrated solutions that support practice productivity, and best medicine. A great example of this is our new hematology analyzer, ProCyte One, recently launched for pre-sale. Both our commercials teams, which were trained last month, and customers are very excited by the performance, usability, and cost profile of the analyzer. We are making solid progress with field trials with approximately 20 units at customer sites and more to follow over the next month. Customer use feedback in a live environment is part of our time-tested approach to ensure that we only ship when the solution is ready to support patient care in the most demanding and varied practice environments. We plan to begin shipping in Q1 with a gradual build in placements over the balance of the year. Expanding our premium installed base is a long-term objective for IDEXX with approximately 200,000 opportunities for placements globally including almost 100,000 hematology placements encompassing competitive, greenfield and upgrades for current customers with legacy analyzers. ProCyte One enables us to access a much broader part of the marketplace as it it\u2019s packed with the latest technology and simplicity, facilitating efficiency of the practice and trusted reference lab quality results. It also has affordable economics, including paper run billing and an inventory replenishment. From a clinical perspective, chemistry and hematology complement each other to provide a four-clinic clinical patient profile. Coupled with our Catalyst One chemistry platform with a growing menu of eight new tests in eight years, ProCyte One is yet another proof point of our commitment to brave comprehensive reference lab quality blood analysis to the point of care, the solutions that are both suited to small and large practices globally. And with our comprehensive program, IDEXX 360, we make access to advanced diagnostics easy and hassle-free for customers, with no up-front equipment costs. We have over the last year expanded IDEXX 360 to offer programs with flexible, early year commitments for new practice formations. This has been extremely well-received by these practices and enables us to grow with them from their earliest days. We also continue to see positive customer experience and adoption of our innovations and product initiatives introduced at VMX in January. A great case in point is our digital cytology service offering. Our first customer satisfaction survey scores were best in class. Customers are delighted with the under two hours, 24 by 7 results promise we consistently deliver on. Moreover, we make reference lab services ordering and results viewing easy and convenient for our customers with our VetConnect PLUS diagnostic results portal. And more recently with IDEXX reference lab data and IVLS. IVLS was formerly used by customers jus with our point of care in clinic suite, but now approximately 2,700 customers are already taking advantage of this new IVLS functionality for reference lab results, too. As noted on our last earnings call, our SediVue advanced bacteria detection kits started to ship in April and over half our North American customers have used the advanced bacteria kit to date. Detecting bacteria and urine is a key driver of clinical value, and we are confident that this enhanced capability will drive even greater appreciation of our SediVue platform. Our IDEXX urinalysis anywhere strategy further differentiates us by offering customer solutions that are unique, providing common flexibility to test at the practice or our lab, with seamless order integration and unified pricing. Our customers value our holistic customer-centric approach like urinalysis anywhere, and we see that appreciation reflected in very high customer retention rates. Moving on to our veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging businesses. We saw strong new software system placements in Q3, supported by the hard work of our commercial organization and the healthy pipeline they built earlier in the year, with 35% growth year-over-year in new PIMS placements globally, including on premise and cloud systems. Although diagnostic imaging new systems placements decreased year-over-year, as access to veterinary practices was pressured by COVID-19, our customers are excited about the ImageVue DR30, our new digital imaging system we announced in August. The DR30, along with our other imaging products offers the most advanced digital imaging technology in a market, with software capabilities that provides streamlined workflow and efficiency of the practice. The continued growth of our software and digital imaging systems install base and subscription customers for cloud solutions are driving strong, double-digit growth in our recurring service revenues. As we advance our commercial capabilities, we\u2019re also advancing our commitment to the positive impact we make in the communities we serve. Today I\u2019m excited to share that we have established an IDEXX foundation, a donor-advised charitable fund with a contribution of $10 million to support activities aligned with our purpose : to enhance the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock. As part of IDEXX\u2019s overall corporate responsibility efforts, IDEXX has invested for decades in organizations and initiatives aligned with our purpose and guiding principles. The IDEXX foundation will complement our ongoing local partnerships while also broadening our geographic reach and social impact. The IDEXX foundation\u2019s priorities will be on long-term outcomes-focused investments in areas such as supporting education in the veterinary and stem fields, including diversity, equity and inclusion in animal health care. We\u2019re excited about this important step in support of our purpose and mission. The health and safety of our workforce and their families and our communities also continues to be a top priority for us. The majority of IDEXX employees continue to work remotely and as travel remains limited, employees leverage virtual technology to stay connected and engaged from their home offices. Our on-site teams continue to execute at very high levels to support exceptional market demand, while maintaining important health and safety procedures. Overall, we\u2019re excited about the strong, continued market performance and resilience in animal health and more specifically, in our category. We\u2019re positioning ourselves to support continued strong growth, aligned with our long-term potential and financial goals. This means continued investment in innovative solutions that solve the most challenging problems faced by veterinarians. And the expanded commercial capability to bring the innovations to new and existing customers and markets. While the resilience of our industry and IDEXX\u2019s business in particular is extraordinary, the situation remains dynamic. We will continue to monitor closely the pandemic\u2019s impact on consumers and pet owners and react appropriately. Lastly, I would like to take the opportunity to thank both our employees and customers for their resilience and perseverance during economic uncertainties and new challenging workplace and employee safety requirements. I\u2019m extremely proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished together in the last two quarters and look forward to the journey still before us. And that concludes my opening remarks. We now have time for some questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Ryan Daniels from William Blair. Ryan Daniels : And thanks for all the detailed information. I\u2019m curious if you could speak a little bit to the international growth outlook and your investments there. It\u2019s a somewhat interesting dichotomy because you\u2019re seeing a lot of strength in the industry in OUS, and sounds like you\u2019re making a significant expansion. But there is also an ongoing uptick in COVID cases and more lockdowns. So I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re balancing the growth in your field sales force in particular, contrasting that against what could be potential more market hiccups going forward. Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yes, thanks. Thanks, Ryan. I\u2019ll take that, and Brian may add some additional color. We see the international opportunity as very significant, about two-thirds of the potential addressable market. And we know our international customers, pet owners, love their pets as much as we do. So it\u2019s really a question of helping to develop the marketplace. We see a lot of parallels to what we\u2019ve done in the U.S. to market creation overseas. So that speaks to the investments we\u2019ve made in terms of field footprint which brings diagnostics subject-matter experts, a reference lab which builds out the lab network and provide the type of service levels our European customers in this case expect, a number of investments in information management solutions, as well as products like Catalyst One, and now ProCyte One that fit those markets really well from a footprint and price standpoint. So we saw very nice growth in international, 29% recurring revenue on an organic basis. We have seen some renewal second wave, third wave of cases in parts of the U.S., but also parts of Europe. We think our customers will work through that. We\u2019ll work through that with them. That can provide potentially some short-term headwinds. But overall, the investments are really pointed towards the long-term potential growth of the marketplace. Brian, did you want to add anything to that? Brian McKeon : Yes, no. I think that, I think, Ryan, is the key point as we\u2019re really encouraged by the resilience of the markets globally. I think it reinforces there is sustaining long-term growth potential and underlying health from the business. We do anticipate there could be some bumps in front of us just in terms of the management of the pandemic. But we\u2019re very focused on ensuring we continue to invest towards long-term market development, and that includes adding commercial resources that can support that. So we\u2019re trying to be balanced on that front. I think we\u2019re demonstrating that we can deliver good financial performance as we invest, and we\u2019re intending to lean into the positive growth trends that we\u2019ve been seeing, specifically since the second quarter. Ryan Daniels : And then one more follow-up, I guess. You mentioned this I think, Jay, during your comments. We have seen some flow of product sales and pharmaceuticals to online and curbside pickup. And that could be a behavior change that sustains for a long period and drains some form of revenue from your client base. So I\u2019m curious if you view that as a big tailwind for Diagnostics, given that\u2019s something that is high profit that really can\u2019t leave the clinic. Are you hearing from your sales teams or from vets they\u2019re viewing this more as a kind of sustainable long-term revenue stream that they\u2019re going to focus on more going forward given potential structural changes? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Keep in mind, that\u2019s a trend that\u2019s been going on for a while, the pivot to online sales, both pharmaceutical, probably more so on the specialty-diet front. If anything, COVID may have accelerated that. And we have seen veterinarians, even pre-COVID, talk about the fact that they are pivoting to focus more on delivering veterinary services. And to treat, you obviously have to diagnose, so we do think it\u2019s an area of the practice that\u2019s not tradable. It\u2019s not going to migrate outside the practice just by its very nature. So we do see that as a positive trend that it had already existed. And it may accelerate over time, but not necessarily unique to the COVID environment. Operator : Our next question is from Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Erin Wright : Kind of a follow-up to that, how you play into telemedicine and virtual care, but also on the preventative care side, can you give us an update on the traction there? And how you can rope that into kind of the telemedicine and virtual care landscape, and how you can really play into that trend because it\u2019s kind of counterintuitive how that impacts IDEXX? Jay Mazelsky : Sure. In terms of the telemedicine, as part of revised workflows that practice has adopted early on, so this goes back to sort of the April/May time frame with patient curbside drop off and pickup and restricted access. A lot of practices look to telemedicine solutions. It\u2019s primarily more a software solution than something you would see on the human side with Teladoc. And our solutions integrate with the telemedicine offerings on the marketplace. And we have seen a lot of interest in it. Whether or not that sustains post-COVID remains to be seen. We think, ultimately, it\u2019s a positive for our business, especially if it brings like more cats into the practice and initial diagnoses of cats that may require a physical visit to the practice. In terms of preventive care, as I mentioned in my remarks, we saw towards the tail end of the quarter more or less pre-COVID levels of enrollments. So we were 230 or so for the quarter which is slightly less than pre-COVID, but again there was movement towards the end of the quarter to more normal levels. And that\u2019s to be expected. These type of programs require a fair amount of in-clinic access from both an on-boarding and repeated training standpoint across the entire staff. But there is tremendous interest in the programs that piggyback on the tremendous interest in wellness in general. I think tying together your question and Ryan\u2019s question, it really does speak to the service orientation that we see amongst veterinarians, and obviously wellness and preventative care is a big piece of that. Erin Wright : And on the capital equipment side, when will that come back? How much is it attributable to willingness to spend on capital equipment in this environment versus product cycle dynamics? And have you seen any aggressive promotional activity or changes in the competitive environment on that front? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yes, I\u2019ll provide a couple comments on that, and Brian may add some additional flavor. We did see a fairly dramatic recovery from Q2 levels. That capital equipment placement is both a function of clinic access \u2013 and that has remained somewhat restricted. We\u2019re at 50% in the U.S., 60% overall in-person visits internationally \u2013 but it\u2019s also a function, as Brian indicated in his remarks, of just the prefaces are busy. And if you think about placing an in-clinic suite that requires training and some workflow modifications, integration into their local network, they have to hit the pause button for some period of time in which to be able to do that. And when they\u2019re working pretty much the full days without a lot of gaps in their schedules that can be challenging in itself. But we do expect continued recovery throughout the year. It\u2019s really just a function of you know COVID-19 and the environment and its impact on practice access. Brian McKeon : Yes, I think what we\u2019ve learned to date through the pandemic, Erin, is that we don\u2019t see a caution for capital outlies as being something that\u2019s indicated by the sales force as being a challenge or changing competitive dynamics, anything like that. In fact, our retention levels are at record high levels. They actually improved. And we feel very positive about the dialogues we\u2019re having. I think, to Jay\u2019s point, it\u2019s more about access and just how busy the vets are. We would highlight that as you look at the case increases, the area that I think we anticipate relatively more impact is in things like instrument placements because that can be a prioritization of where vets are spending their time. The good news is the underlying demand in the market has consistently been so strong in this recovery that, that puts the industry in a good position what they can grow at a healthy rate. But we could see ongoing deferrals on this front if we\u2019re working through, again, kind of lockdown or enhanced social distancing procedures that add to some of the restrictions we\u2019ve seen. But good improvement, as Jay noted, from Q2 to Q3. Encouraging. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Ryskin from Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : Jay, a quick one to start, just to follow-up on something that came up earlier. I just want to be clear. Have you seen any moderation whatsoever in some of the European markets like - specifically like France, Germany, UK, where we\u2019ve seen a little bit more of an uptick. I\u2019m just trying to delineate any trends you could be seeing in visits, the impact from on the one hand an increase in COVID cases and on the other hand an increase in government lockdown. I think what we\u2019ve seen previously is sort of that first wave and the key was it really was the lockdowns that drove it. And if we look at the U.S. data but by region it doesn\u2019t really seem like there is an impact so far, but I want to be clear if you\u2019ve noticed anything in some of the parts of the world where the second wave is a little bit more advanced. Jay Mazelsky : Well. I will - oh, go ahead. Brian McKeon : Yes, Mike, maybe just this context. I know you\u2019ve seen the - just this context. The U.S. data, we do report on that. And that the visits were sustained kind of solidly into Q4 and the non-wellness is sustaining well so even with some of the moderation we would expect in the pent-up wellness demand that\u2019s held up well. Jay can talk to this, but I would say in international markets you don\u2019t have the same level of kind of wellness benefit, if you will, in terms of just how they provide care. And what we saw in markets in Europe and in Asia was very strong recovery, kind of some benefits from some pent-up demand and kind of gravitation more towards kind of pre-COVID type volume growth rates late in Q3. And so I think it\u2019s early to look at how new lockdowns might impact the business.  Clearly that had been a factor back in March and April. I think the markets have learned to adapt here to continue to provide services. As mentioned earlier I think we would anticipate this could cause some constraints on areas like instrument placements, and you know there is always a chance selectively this could impact some underlying demand or prioritization of services, but I think it\u2019s early for us to make any projections on that front. Jay Mazelsky : Yes, let me just build on a couple of those points. Our international markets are more biased towards in-clinic testing as well as non-wellness or sick patient testing, which is less impacted by COVID-related social distancing policies. So to Brian\u2019s point we believe we have seen a return to more or less pre-COVID levels internationally, but the mix and flavor is a little bit different than what we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. And with the non-wellness testing, the percentage of diagnostics usage is also higher. It\u2019s close to 80% or so from a split standpoint between non-wellness and wellness. So hopefully that gives you some flavor on potential impacts Michael Ryskin : And you\u2019re right, just now looking at the snapshot you guys posted on the website, kind of parse into it as much as you can. It does seem like the West region and the Midwest has held in really well. And that\u2019s where the second wave in the U.S. has been, so that does indicate that it\u2019s a little more stable. Quick follow up for me, Brian, for you on some of the spending and investments going forward. You touched on this earlier, obviously very strong free cash flow year-to-date. You talked about starting to ramp things up again. Could you go into a little bit more detail going forward beyond some of the international investments and the R&D you talked about in 4Q with ProCyte. What else are you targeting? How sustained is this going to be? Is this going to be some catch-up spend maybe you pulled back early in the year? Or is this going to be a new higher level that\u2019s more sustained going forward? And then also on the capital deployment front, if there\u2019s any changes there beyond your comments on the share buybacks? Brian McKeon : Yes, at a high level we\u2019re transitioning from a period early on where we tried to be really cautious on investments with a lot of unknowns in front of us with business growth. And like many companies, froze hiring and pulled back on compensation and tried to ensure we\u2019re in a good place. And we are now going through a period where we have a higher level of confidence on the underlying market growth. We are getting ready for 2021 and thinking about how we\u2019re going to manage our business going forward. And we\u2019re starting to advance new hiring and positions that we had frozen, and things we wanted to move forward with. We\u2019re adding staffing in our labs to try to keep up with 20%-plus volume growth. And I think this is more indicative of us having a higher level of confidence in the kind of the underlying market demand and how COVID may impact our business and ensuring we\u2019re prepared for that going forward. We are doing catch up on areas, I can tell you in central compensation accruals and things like that, that we were quite conservative earlier in the year and we\u2019re in a better place to support that now. And we reinstated salary reductions and reinstated 401(k) reductions and things like that. So there is some of that going on. But I think the bigger picture here is we\u2019re looking at a market and our business that\u2019s growing at very healthy rates, and we want to ensure that we\u2019re investing towards that and supporting that and have confidence that we can do that well while delivering financial performance that\u2019s aligned with our long-term goals. Operator : Our next question is from Jon Block from Stifel. Jon Block : Thanks for the time, guys. Good Morning. Maybe first question we\u2019ll just start with ProCyte One and the year one, or essentially the 2021 contribution, and I don\u2019t expect details. But if you can help us think it through or conceptualize what that contribution might be. And I\u2019ll throw two things at you. I think SediVue was over 2,000 units-ish in the first 12 months. And if I look at your snapshot your hematology base is over 30,000. And so if you were to turn 10% of that base that\u2019s 3,000 units, is that a good ballpark to think about that this should somewhat replicate a SediVue type launch? Should it be greater because SediVue was arguably pioneering in urine sediment in clinic? Jay, maybe if you can just talk to that and the dynamics, that\u2019d be very helpful. Jay Mazelsky : Sure. I think about ProCyte One more from the standpoint, just as a benchmark analog more from the standpoint that Catalyst One as a reasonable benchmark for pace of the placement belt. Keep in mind, Catalyst One had a longer presale period than ProCyte One, so you got to take that into consideration. To your point, it is - hematology is a more established marketplace. There\u2019s certainly, I think a lot of interest for it. But the way we\u2019re rolling it out is first in North America and then follow quickly thereafter internationally, where there\u2019s a really nice, I think two-thirds plus of the opportunity is there. So you would have to take that into consideration. The other thing is, ProCyte One will have a - we believe it\u2019ll have a very high attach rate with chemistry. So our focus is really on being able to place suites of chemistry, hematology and potentially, urinalysis versus just taking ProCyte One, and let\u2019s say upgrading a laser site account or just a single competitive hematology account. Brian, did you want to add anything to that? Brian McKeon : No. I think that\u2019s all the right kind of background. I think we - as Jay noted, we\u2019ll be rolling this out gradually through the year or - so some of this will depend on how the exact timing of how that phases. And I think the Catalyst One launch is a reasonable benchmark. But we\u2019ll provide more insight on that as we get closer to year-end call, we\u2019ll give some more indications of how we\u2019re feeling about that outlook. Jon Block : And the second one I\u2019ll pivot - Brian, I\u2019m long overdue for a margin question so I\u2019ll throw one your way. But I know you\u2019re not guiding. But if we can just talk about margin expansion next year and just puts and takes. And where I\u2019m going with this is your 50 to 100 bp goal, I don\u2019t think you ever backed off that goal even in years when you significantly outperformed. And I just want to check in on how we should be thinking about this next year; in other words, in 2020, clearly margins are benefiting from some of the temporary salary reductions you had in place. They\u2019re benefiting notably from a mix shift perspective, right, as the equipment\u2019s been down and the recurring is just ripped. And so do you sort of stick to that 50 to 100 bp thought next year? Or as we get into 2021, do we have to normalize for some of the variables that I just threw out at you when we think about the rate of expansion into next year? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : We\u2019re shooting for the same long-term goals, Jon. So it\u2019s that 50 to 100 is \u2013 that\u2019s, we think a very reasonable estimate. We think we can deliver that in this kind of business. Clearly, you adjust for certain things like the litigation accrual things that are one-time in nature that we try to highlight, right. But you know, we\u2019re not providing specific guidance, but we have the same long-term goals. And as you know, when we\u2019re executing well in our growth and we have high CAG Diagnostic recurring growth, it puts us in a good position to deliver against the goals and support investment of the business. So more to follow on that but same goals for the business. Operator : Our next question is from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : Jay, maybe to start, you highlighted a number of favorable trends kind of impacting the growth in the CAG diagnostics business. As we think about a little bit longer term about how that could kind of translate into what you guys see into 2021 and beyond, looking at the growth you saw this quarter, I think there were some factors like pent-up demand and growth from new patients that you guys quantified that maybe subside longer term. But it seems like the CAG diagnostics growth even excluding 3% to 4% from those maybe shorter-term dynamics would still have been in the mid to high teens. So I guess what I\u2019m asking is do you feel like based on the positive trends that you\u2019re seeing in the business that that type of CAG diagnostics recurring growth would be sustainable longer-term? Jay Mazelsky : Yes. I\u2019ll give you just maybe some additional flavor on that. So just setting aside the pent-up demand piece because I think from a wellness standpoint I think a lot of that worked through in Q3. So the two or three maybe rather longer-term trends we\u2019re tracking from a sustainability standpoint is the new clinical patient visits, and we think that that is something that obviously if there is a lot of new puppies and kittens to the marketplace that they\u2019re going to need care, and that as they age. So that\u2019s certainly a positive. And we want to more data and see how that develops over time. And then I spoke to use and intensity of diagnostics, and that\u2019s tied up in this whole pivot to service, use in terms of more visits include diagnostics, and intensity when they use diagnostics it\u2019s at a higher average dollar volume. And some of that is in our control in terms of our commercial approach and innovations and being able to provide to veterinarians the tools that allow them to cover it more. So that\u2019s certainly something that we\u2019ve invested in even pre-COVID, and I think we\u2019re seeing the fruits of it. And it may be on top of an accelerated pivot to services that we see on the part of veterinarians. So certainly, those are positives for the business. I think we just need more time to see how they play out and at what level. Nathan Rich : And then if I could follow up on John\u2019s questions on margin, maybe looking at the CAG segment specifically. Gross margin was stronger than we had expected. I think the driver that you called out with reference lab productivity, obviously favorable mix, and then the price gains. Do you feel like that\u2019s sustainable over the next several quarters? And on reference labs specifically, you kind of mentioned adding staffing. Does that create any sort of maybe drag relative to what we\u2019ve seen over the past one or two quarters for the CAG segment? Jay Mazelsky : Big driver in Q3 was lab productivity when we had 20-plus percent kind of growth and controls on costs. And we\u2019re not projecting sustained 24% kind of grow-through levels in the lab business. We\u2019re encouraged by the trends. So that is \u2013 we think that we\u2019ll continue to be able to get lab productivity, and we do need to add staffing. But that\u2019s more of a moderator than it is something that\u2019s a headwind if you will. So I think we do think we\u2019re in a good position to continue to get positive gross margin gains when you have high CAG recurring growth, and we\u2019re just highlighting that we\u2019re adding some investments back in the business, and trying to position ourselves going forward. So it\u2019s more of something that will moderate the gains. And just to reinforce, our goals are annually 50 to 100 bps of improvement, and we want to deliver good performance, but also ensure that we continue to invest towards long-term market development. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on as we\u2019re heading into next year. Operator : We have a question from David Westenberg from Guggenheim Securities. David Westenberg : Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a great quarter. So when we\u2019re looking at macro data I think we\u2019re seeing a gap over the last two quarters between practice revenue and practice volumes. I tend to think about maybe Diagnostics as being a benefit of volumes, and maybe the reason for the increase in revenue on a per-visit basis, or year-over-year basis. So am I thinking about that the right way that you actually would be on volume, and then you\u2019re actually just the cause of the practice increasing in revenue? And the reason why I kind of ask is if we look into next year and we think about how to model the company and how to \u2013 our expectation, should we be thinking about a factor \u2013 like this major factor above volume? Or should we be thinking about this as this lower factor above revenue in the practice growth? Jay Mazelsky : Well, yes, so let me try to address that on a couple different levels. The practice revenue growth has been obviously very strong over the year. We saw 10.5%, 11% most recently. So that\u2019s \u2013 obviously, our Diagnostics growth has been faster than that, and we\u2019ve always believed that Diagnostics enables and drives services within the practice. And your question as the longer-term sustainability feeds into the discussion that we have previously around the pivot to services, veterinarians interested and obviously meeting demand for new clinical patient visits as well as being able to focus on what they do best, which is caring for patients. But I think is a positive backdrop for all the reasons cited, and we\u2019ll see how that plays out. Brian McKeon : Let me give you some metrics that maybe can help with this a little bit which is over the last five years, so if you break down the revenue per practice, Diagnostics revenue growth per practice growth that Jay referred in the call, it was about a 7.5% increase on average over the last five years. Roughly 3% of that was from visit growth. 0.5% contribution came from frequency, so that\u2019s the percentage of visits that include Diagnostics. And about 4% of that, which we mentioned was growth in Diagnostics revenue per visit. So year-to-date what we\u2019re seeing is 1% from clinical visit growth, a 3.5% contribution from frequency increases, and a 6% increase from revenue increases. And so we\u2019re learning about this. But to answer your question, it is both volume, which would be the frequency dynamic and the revenue piece, and that is the central question. Kind of like what\u2019s going on here? Is this sustainable? Do we see this expanding over time?  Clearly, the clinical visit dynamics we\u2019re coming to understand. In terms of it\u2019s healthy overall, and perhaps there\u2019s some benefit from new patients that can sustain. But I think this underlying trend of diagnostic frequency and utilization which has been a long-term trend for us, expanding it, the question is are some of the things going on through the pandemic, some of the learnings, the changing how service is being delivered, could that set the stage for some accelerated growth? So early to predict it. We\u2019re encouraged by it, and it\u2019s certainly consistent with what we\u2019ve been trying to do in the market. So it\u2019s something that we look to build upon. Brian McKeon : I think we\u2019re out of time, unfortunately, so we\u2019re going to\u2026 Jay Mazelsky : Yes, so want to thank everybody for calling in. I know we have some employees who are also on the call, and I want to express my gratitude for their extraordinary performance during these obviously challenging times. We run the company in a way that takes a long-term view of the opportunities ahead of us while still delivering the day. And I couldn\u2019t be more appreciative of the IDEXX team and the purpose which animates our work. And so with that, we\u2019ll conclude the call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Participating in the call this morning are Jay Mazelsky, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian McKeon, Chief Financial Officer; and John Ravis, Senior Director, Investor Relations. IDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements. Listeners are reminded that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the forward-looking statements notice in our press release, issued this morning as well as in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website, idexx.com. During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. In reviewing our fourth quarter 2020 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth, constant currency growth, and comparable constant currency growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2019 unless otherwise noted. [Operator Instructions] To allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit their questions to one, with one follow-up as necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we will take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results and to provide an overview of our initial financial outlook for 2021. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered excellent financial results in Q4, supported by expanding global demand for companion animal health care. Revenue increased 19% as reported and 17% organically, driven by 21% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth sustained at high levels across U.S. and international markets through the fourth quarter, reflecting continued strong clinical visit growth trends and increased utilization of diagnostics. Flow-through operating margin benefits from high CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth supported achievement of $2.01 in EPS, which included a $0.25 nonrecurring tax benefit and $0.13 in tax benefit from stock-based compensation activity. Strong CAG growth results and proactive cost controls supported delivery of outstanding full year 2020 financial performance, above our long-term goals. IDEXX achieved 12% full year organic revenue growth, driven by nearly 15% gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Full year operating margins reached 25.7%, an increase of 340 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis. The combination of high revenue growth and operating margin gains supported delivery of full year EPS of $6.71 per share, an increase of 31% on a comparable constant currency basis. Robust CAG market trends position us for continued strong financial performance in 2021. Today, we're providing our initial outlook for full year revenue growth and key financial metrics and an expanded information table shown in our press release and snapshot. Highlights include an outlook for 11.5% to 13.5% overall organic revenue growth, supported by 12% to 14.5% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Our financial outlook reflects a targeted 50 to 100 basis point improvement in operating margins on a comparable constant currency basis, building on strong 2020 performance. These gains are projected to support 15% to 20% comparable constant currency EPS growth, aligned with our long-term goals. We'll discuss our 2021 outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year results and recent market trends. Fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 17% was driven by 21% gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting 21% growth in the U.S. and 22% gains in international markets. Strong overall organic growth was also supported by 13% organic gains in our LPD business and approximately $10 million or 1.5% of growth benefit from our OPTI human COVID-19 test initiatives. Overall, organic growth was moderated by pandemic related pressures, which constrained water revenue growth and contributed to a 10% year-on-year decline in IDEXX VetLab instrument revenues. As noted, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains sustained at high levels through the fourth quarter. CAG growth dynamics remain healthy across global markets with 20% or higher CAG Diagnostic recurring organic revenue gains achieved in the North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin American regions. For the full year 2020, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth increased an impressive 15% in both U.S. and international markets. High U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains continue to be aided by strong growth in clinical visits. Overall, U.S. same-store clinical visit growth reached 8% in Q4, up from 6% growth in Q3, reflecting sustained 10% growth in wellness visits and higher 10% growth in non-wellness visits. A factor continuing to support high clinical visit gains is an increase in first-time clinical patient visits, which we estimate added 1.5% to 2% to overall clinical visit growth and 2.5% to 3% to wellness visit growth in the quarter. An increased focus on health care services, including diagnostics, supported a 12% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q4, well ahead of an improved 4% growth in overall visits to veterinary clinics in the quarter. These positive market dynamics and benefits from investments in IDEXX's commercial capability, wellness program initiatives and technology to support higher standards of care drove high Q4 and full year organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities. IDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 19% organically in Q4 led by nearly 20% organic growth in the U.S. and mid to high teens organic growth in international markets. Reference lab gains continue to be driven by high same-store volume growth with strong gains across testing categories, including support from high levels of wellness testing in the U.S. and benefits from the expansion of IDEXX 360 program agreements in international markets. For the full year 2020, global lab revenues increased 13% organically, reflecting mid-teen organic gains in the U.S., and approximately 10% growth overall in international markets. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 25% on an organic basis in Q4, reflecting high growth across U.S. and international markets. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels and expansion of our global premium installed base. These dynamics supported a 19% full-year growth in IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues in 2020. While CAG instrument placements continue to be constrained by pandemic impacts restricted \u2013 restricting sales access to vet clinics, trends have improved solidly over the second half of 2020. In Q4, CAG instrument revenues were $3 million below strong prior year levels, representing a 10% year-over-year organic revenue decline. Overall global Catalyst placements in Q4 were 13% below strong prior year levels, which included high levels of international upgrades. While overall placement levels were constrained to a degree by the pandemic, the quality of CAG instrument placements remained high. Globally, placements at new and competitive accounts were down approximately 4% compared to strong prior year levels. These results reflected 414 Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America and 1,092 new and competitive placements in international markets. We also placed 525 second Catalysts globally to support high-growth with our customers. New placements and continued high customer retention levels drove a 13% year-on-year increase in our global Catalyst installed base. We achieved 1,224 premium hematology placements in Q4, supporting a 10% year-on-year expansion in our premium hematology installed base. We also placed 671 SediVue analyzers, bringing our global SediVue installed base to nearly 10,700 instruments, up 20% year-on-year. Rapid assay revenue increased 20% organically in Q4, driven by high-growth in the U.S., aligned with broader gains in demand for diagnostic testing, including robust gains in clinical wellness business. For the full year 2020, rapid assay organic revenue growth was 9%, reflecting strong volume gains for canine, 4Dx, feline and specialty testing. Overall, CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume-driven, augmented by consistent net price gains of 2% to 3%. We're planning for similar levels of net price improvement in CAG recurring revenues in 2021. In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 1% organically overall in the fourth quarter. Double-digit gains in recurring service revenues and solid growth in new software system placements were moderated by lower diagnostic imaging system placement levels. For the full year 2020, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 3% organically, as strong gains in software services were offset by pandemic-related pressure on new imaging system placements. Turning to our other business segments. Water business revenues posted modest organic growth in Q4, as solid gains in compliance testing were offset by pandemic-related pressure on non-compliance-related activity. These impacts contributed to a 2% organic decline in full year 2020 Water revenues. While recent trends in our Water business have improved relatively, we're planning for uneven demand in non-compliance testing in 2021, as we continue to work through pandemic-related impacts. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue increased 13% organically in Q4, driven by continued strong growth in our Asia-Pacific region. Better-than-expected LPD results reflected high demand for diagnostic testing programs for African Swine Fever and gains in core swine testing volumes in China, supported by large producer efforts to rebuild swine herds. These gains offset lower herd health screening levels in export markets compared to strong prior year results. For the full year, LPD revenues increased 11% organically. Looking ahead to 2021, we expect to see constraints on LPD growth rates as we lap the benefits of the 2020 step-up in revenues from expanded African Swine Fever testing programs. Turning to the P&, operating profit results were very strong in Q4 reflecting flow-through from high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains. As a reminder, prior year operating profit results were impacted by $13 million in CEO transition charges. Normalizing for these impacts, operating profits increased 43% year-on-year in Q4 on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting 460 basis points of comparable operating margin improvement. Gross profit increased 24% in the fourth quarter. Gross margins increased 210 basis points on a reported basis and 270 basis points on a constant currency basis. These results reflected productivity gains in our lab operations supported by high organic lab revenue growth as well as favorable net mix impacts from strong consumable sales and lower instrument revenues and benefits from moderate net price gains. Operating expenses in Q4 increased 4% on a reported basis and 10% on a comparable constant currency basis, excluding impacts from the 2019 CEO transition charges. Relatively accelerated operating expense growth reflected higher incentive compensation and healthcare costs as well as increased investment in R&D and enhancement of our global CAG commercial capability. We anticipate sustaining a relatively higher rate of OpEx growth moving forward as we support our strong global growth momentum. For the full year 2020, operating margins reached 25.7%, up 270 basis points as reported and 340 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting high CAG Diagnostic revenue growth and benefit from cost controls. As highlighted in our initial guidance for 2021, we're targeting to build on this strong performance as we advance high return investments aligned with our long-term growth strategy. The EPS in Q4 was $2.01 per share, including $0.25 per share in non-recurring tax benefit and $0.13 per share in tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity. For the full year 2020, EPS was $6.71, up 31% on a comparable constant currency basis. Full year EPS results also included $39 million or $0.45 per share and tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity, which provided 590 basis points of effective tax rate benefit and $22 million or 330 basis points of effective tax rate benefit from the non-recurring tax item. In terms of other factors impacting our reported results, foreign exchange effects have turned favorable given the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar. In Q4, FX added nearly 2% to revenue growth and $1 million to operating profit net of Q4 hedge losses of approximately $2 million. For the full year 2020, foreign exchange rates decreased EPS by $0.06 per share, net of FX hedge gains of $1 million. Free cash flow was $541 million for 2020. Free cash flow conversion was 93% of net income or 97% adjusted for our investments at our Westbrook headquarter expansion and German lab relocation, which are now complete. Our balance sheet is in a very strong position. We ended 2020 with leverage ratios of 1.1 times gross and 0.64 times net of cash with $384 million in cash and no borrowings outstanding on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We didn't allocate capital to share repurchases in the fourth quarter, but we have reinitiated share repurchases in Q1, reflecting confidence in our long-term growth strategy. Turning to our 2021 outlook. As noted, we've included a table in our press release and snapshot reflecting our initial outlook for revenue growth and other key financial metrics, recognizing that it remains a relatively dynamic environment in terms of financial forecasting. Our initial overall organic revenue growth outlook of 11.5% to 13.5% is centered on an estimated organic growth range of 12% to 14.5% for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue. As a benchmark, this recurring revenue growth outlook aligns with projections for 2% to 5% same-store U.S. clinical visit growth for the full year 2021, building on strong 2020 momentum and a premium of IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth to clinical visit growth of approximately 900 to 1,000 basis points, which is consistent with our strong growth trends heading into the pandemic. Our growth outlook range reflects our plans to drive continued high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth globally while also recognizing each year-on-year comparisons to very strong 2020 growth levels in the second half of the year. In terms of overall organic growth, we factored in an estimated 1% overall growth benefit from higher CAG Diagnostic capital instrument revenues, including net growth benefits from the ProCyte One launch this year. These positive impacts are expected to be moderated by tougher comparisons in our LPD business and continued COVID related growth pressures in certain areas such as water noncompliance testing demand. Please note that given the lapping of prior year COVID impacts, there will likely be significant variability in year-on-year revenue growth rates by quarter with expectations for higher revenue growth in the first half of 2021. In terms of key financial metrics, as noted, we're targeting 50 to 100 basis points of annual comparable constant currency operating margin improvement in 2021. This is reflected in a reported operating margin outlook for 2021 of 27.3% to 27.8%. We're planning for continued solid momentum from gross margin gains with some moderation and benefits related to product mix impacts and increased lab staffing to support high-volume growth. Overall, we anticipate sustaining a relatively higher rate of OpEx growth moving forward as we support our strong growth trends. We also expect some relative year-on-year increases in costs in certain areas such as employee health care costs, claims and travel costs as pandemic related restrictions are eased. Our outlook incorporates projection for foreign exchange to be a net positive factor in 2021 at recent exchange rates. At the exchange rate shown in our press release, we estimate FX will provide a positive 1.5% to 2% revenue growth impact in 2021 and approximately $0.14 of EPS benefit net of established hedge positions. We've included an outlook for net interest expense that assumes maintenance of a relatively consistent net leverage ratio in 2021. Given reduced share repurchase activity in 2020; we're projecting more limited year-on-year EPS growth benefit from reductions in average shares outstanding. Our 2021 outlook includes an estimated $0.09 to $0.11 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity compared to a much higher than anticipated $0.45 per share benefit in 2020. Our 2021 estimates reflect known option expirations and any established 10b5-1 plans. In terms of managing our 2021 financial performance, our focus will be on delivering strong full year results, while advancing our long-term growth strategy prudently in a dynamic environment. Given the strong momentum in our CAG business, we're inclined to lean in towards high-return organic growth-oriented investments while delivering continued improvement in operating margins, aligned with our long-term goals. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Jay Mazelsky : Thanks, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX had a strong finish to 2020, driven by exceptional CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth. Strong CAG market trends continued through Q4, enabling us to deliver outstanding full year performance with 12% overall organic growth, significant expansion of our operating margins, 31% EPS growth on a comparable constant currency basis and 55% return on invested capital. While managing through pandemic impacts, we deepened our connection with our customers, strengthened our global commercial capability and advanced key elements of our innovation agenda. These steps position us well to build on our business momentum in 2021. Today, I'll provide an update on the trends we're seeing in our markets and some of the dynamics that are supporting the impressive growth rates we've achieved in our core business. I'll also provide an update on some of our key growth initiatives in areas of emphasis this year. Finally, I'll discuss how we plan to manage the business, aligned with our initial financial outlook in what remains a dynamic macro environment. Let's begin with an update on market trends. We continue to see strong growth trends in Companion Animal healthcare reflected in high-growth in same-store clinical visits in the U.S., higher growth in new patients and an accelerated expansion of care. We also saw sustained solid market recovery across international markets, despite pandemic impacts. As Brian noted, clinical visits were up 8% overall in the U.S. in Q4, led by wellness visit growth of 10% and strong non-wellness, same-store growth of 7%. For the full year, clinical visit growth was approximately 3%, consistent with the growth we have seen in recent years, though with wide variations by quarter due to pandemic effects. Solid U.S. market growth trends have continued into early 2021. Market feedback from veterinarians remains consistent. Clinics are very busy with sustained high levels of demand supported by higher growth in new patients. Our market data tracking in the U.S. indicates a 10% increase in new clinical patients in 2020 versus 2019 growth of 3%, which contributed an estimated 1.5% to 2% of incremental overall same-store clinical visit growth in Q4. There continues to be evidence reinforcing robust growth in the pet population. As an indicator, we've seen a 70% year-over-year growth in IDEXX progesterone test revenue in the second half of 2020 in the U.S., as well as a significant step-up in new clinical patients with first-time pet parents. New patient growth has been augmented by the accelerated expansion of care. Overall revenue generated during clinical visits grew 15% per practice in the U.S. in Q4, driving 12% total revenue growth per practice. Diagnostics revenue is growing even faster at approximately 17.5% per practice in Q4 in the U.S. supporting full year 2020 same-store diagnostics revenue per practice increase of 12%, reflecting a significant step-up in growth in the second half of the year. We saw a clear trend of veterinarians performing more diagnostics in 2020, with average diagnostics revenue per clinical visit with diagnostics up 5% for the year. There are a number of potential drivers for this, which we've noted in recent calls. Pet owners are spending more time with pets during the pandemic. They may be more attuned to their health conditions and care. Curbside checking procedures may also be helping, as pet owners pre-approve diagnostic test runs, as required prior to the visit, helping veterinarians and their staff to provide higher standards of care. And veterinarians continue to pivot the focus on delivering medical services as their core value proposition. We\u2019ve leveraged the strong market backdrop into even faster growth for our business, enabled by our commercial capabilities, clinical innovations and customer-friendly marketing programs. For the full year in 2020, the CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue organic growth premium compared to clinical visit growth expanded to approximately 1,200 basis points in the U.S., up from the 900 to 1,000 basis point range heading into the pandemic. This is a healthy backdrop for our business in 2021. We're planning to support high growth in our CAG business, recognizing there continues to be significant unknown dynamics in the marketplace and the economy as we advance to the next phase of pandemic management. We believe our initial revenue growth outlook of 11.5% to 13.5% overall organic growth and 12% to 14.5% for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth, represents a reasonable planning range in this context. There is considerable momentum in the market to continue expanding utilization of pet healthcare, and our strategy is to work with our veterinary partners through an expanded commercial presence to raise the standard of care through adoption of our testing innovations. A great example of our innovation focus is ProCyte One, our next-generation hematology point-of-care instrument, which is now in its final stages before product launch. ProCyte One will support a global commercial strategy by unlocking broader opportunity and reach to the customer, especially internationally. Veterinarians want chemistry and hematology diagnostics together, and they are busier than ever, making diagnostic solutions delivered with a best-in-class experience, highly relevant. Field trial customers are thrilled with ProCyte One\u2019s streamlined functionality in a compact footprint. With IDEXX 360 access to in-house hematology is easy and affordable, and our paper run and auto replenishment consumables model makes inventory and cash flow management hassle-free. Customer experience trials are proceeding well, and we anticipate beginning analyzer shipments in North America late Q1, but maybe early Q2. As we complete customer experience trials. We will follow with an international rollout beginning of Q2. Our expectation is to build volume throughout 2021. Pre-sale efforts led by our commercial and marketing organizations are raising awareness of our new hematology analyzer, as well as an increased appreciation of our existing world class hematology portfolio. This is generating interest in in-clinic hematology solutions and driving strong hematology placements. Another key area of innovation leverage is urine analysis. Our commercial teams continue to raise awareness about our SediVue\u2019s enhanced capabilities. Now with advanced bacteria detection. Determining whether bacteria are present or not is often the most important part of sediment analysis. Bacterial UTIs are, for example, a common diagnosis that is painful for pets and could be stressful for pet owners. With SediVue's advanced bacteria detection kit, veterinarians have accessed the real-time bacteria detection of the practice, providing early visibility to the absence or presence of bacteria. Customers highly value diagnostic solution for help them practice better medicine. In this case, allowing them to make more informed decisions within the patient window. We also saw strong interest in our SediVue platform in international markets in 2020, driving a greater than 50% increase year-over-year in our installed base outside of North America. Innovations delivered through our technology for life strategy continued to drive greater adoption for our SediVue platform. Innovation can take many forms. And our digital cytology offering is an example of a new personalized service enabled through imaging technology and our global team of over 100 veterinary clinical pathologists. We are pleased with the exceptional feedback and world-class customer satisfaction ratings, point-of-care digital cytology following its launch in Q1 of 2020. Customers are realizing efficiency and clinical benefits in the integrated 24/7/365 service by opening additional appointments in their schedules and enabling same-day treatment plans. Patient results are integrated with major practice management systems with VetConnect PLUS, as well as being available on any iPhone or Android mobile device with the VetConnect PLUS app. It's a great example of how we uniquely support in an integrated way customer clinical and workflow needs. Most of the point-of-care digital cytology placements have been part of a program and almost one-third were combined with premium IDEXX VetLab analyzers. Many placements were important factors in attracting new business for our reference labs. With some customers, we have seen instrument placements accelerate cytology utilization and support strong revenue growth in that category. We'll continue to watch these trends closely as placements expand and more practices fully adopt the instruments into their daily workflow. Now let's transition to an update on our commercial accomplishments and initiatives. Our outstanding results couldn't be accomplished without disciplined commercial execution, which we have highlighted in the past as an essential pillar in our organic growth strategy. We see high returns in investments that allow us to spend more time with customers in person or virtually. As we've noted on the last call, leveraging a long history of U.S. expansions, we have made excellent progress with efforts to significantly expand our commercial footprint in three international country markets. We are on track to complete the expansion and have all new talent hired, trained and onboarded in the first half of this year. We completed our latest U.S. sales force expansion about a year ago now, and the team has ramped productivity, building customer relationships and tenure against customer access pressured from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our team's performance was exceptional, and instrument placement levels continued to improve sequentially in Q4. They remain somewhat constrained due to the restricted access to clinics and veterinary practice priorities focused on supporting high patient demand. In North America, overall premium instrument placements reached prior year levels, and Catalyst placements were up 14% year-over-year in Q4, including strong second Catalyst placements. These results were achieved while access to practices in-person visits by our customer account managers sustained at Q3 levels or 50% of in-person visits. In international markets, we had high levels of new and competitive catalyst placements, almost reaching prior year levels and second catalyst placements more than doubled prior year levels despite a modest pullback in customer account manager in-person visits in Europe. IDEXX 360 continues to gain significant traction in major international markets, supporting customer acquisition and placements of full VetLab suites as well as increased reference lab usage to support customer volume commitments. While we expect that sales professionals access to veterinary clinics will likely continue to be challenged until social distancing policies and measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 are relaxed, we are very pleased with our high level of commercial execution. Our expanded global commercial resources positions us well to pursue the vast opportunities we see in international markets and advance initiatives like preventive care in the U.S. We continue to see tremendous customer interest in establishing and expanding preventive care as an important category of pet healthcare practice. The IDEXX Preventive Care program has never been more timely as practices implement a customer-centric Preventive Care program to support the high levels of wellness visit growth and the growth of puppies and kittens we see in the market. Veterinarians view preventive care as a means to both deliver better pet health care and build healthy relationships with new and existing pet owners. Program enrollments in Q4 were approximately 300 newly enrolled customers, more in line with pre-COVID run rates, bringing our total enrolled practice levels to now over 4,800. Our software portfolio also had an exceptional year with a record-breaking number of PIMS placements globally, and over 20% growth in North America for the full year. The expansion of our PIMS installed base and cloud-based subscription customers supported strong double-digit growth in our software and services recurring revenues. Our cloud-based solutions, in general, continue to enjoy excellent momentum. For example, we now have over 5,300 customers utilizing our IDEXX Web PACS offering, an 18% increase year-over-year. We continue to center our software strategy on our customer workflow and clinical needs. And the COVID-19 pandemic has only increased the need for cloud-based mobile-centric solutions that deliver deep data insights and tools to further elevate patient care and enable practice efficiency. Investing in high-quality workflow solutions will continue to be an area of focus for us. Next, I'd like to highlight the remarkable operational accomplishments of our supply chain and reference lab teams, supporting our customers in an uninterrupted fashion, while keeping up with 20%-plus organic growth in our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues in the second half of 2020. Take our reference lab business, for example. Throughout 2020, not only has the team focused on keeping approximately 2,800 on-site reference lab employees at 80 global lab sites safe but did this while sharing continuity and a positive customer experience in an operating environment where transportation and logistics networks were at times highly challenged. And they didn't miss a beat opening our new Court Westland facility. It has been open since May and is operating exceptionally well. Notably, it is achieving record number of lab assessments for our European business. Before I conclude today's remarks, I want to highlight our efforts to make positive and lasting impacts on the communities we serve. As we announced on the last call, we recently established the IDEXX Foundation, a donor-advised charitable fund to support activities aligned with our purpose. Our mission is to create positive lasting impact for people, animals and the environment through inclusive and outcomes-focused initiatives. An area of focus that support the advancement of diversity in the veterinary profession by providing access to learning opportunities, I'm proud to share our inaugural, multiyear engagement with Tuskegee College of Veterinary Medicine, which has been recognized as the most diverse veterinary medical school in the U.S. and has educated more than 70% of the nation's African-American veterinarians. The IDEXX Tuskegee Scholars' Fund will support nine fully funded scholarships, as well as wellbeing and mental health support programs for veterinary students. We are excited about this important initiative in support of our purpose and mission. Before we turn to Q&A, I wish to express my gratitude and thanks to our employees for a superb year in pursuit of our purpose. 2020 was a year like we've never experienced, a disruptive year that challenged all levels of the organization. We maintained the operating rhythm in the business, while responding with agility as circumstances required. The team's resilience is a testament to the purpose-driven and innovative culture at IDEXX. The organization stayed focused on serving our customers in an exceptional way while achieving a new high for employee engagement. I couldn't be prouder and more grateful for the teamwork, collaboration and professionalism that resulted in record performance in the face of unknowable challenges. And that concludes my opening remarks. We now have time for some questions. Operator : Thank you. And we\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And from Bank of America, we have Michael Ryskin. Please go ahead. Michael Ryskin : Hey, Jay, Brian, thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the quarter, first of all. I want to start with your comments on the guide and the outlook going forward, and that's where we've had the most feedback from investors and where most of the attention is. If you think about what you guys said about clinical visit growth next year, other parts of the revenue bridge, things of diagnostics utilization, they're more in line with 2020 as a whole but still a little bit of a step-down sequentially just from what we're seeing in 3Q 2020, 4Q 2020, with clinical visits being up mid to high single digits. So I'm just wondering, when we think about those components of the bridge, of the revenue bridge for next year, are you baking any conservatism in the second half, or does this reflect a little bit of your views of something like we would refer to pre-COVID landscape, especially once the vaccines are rolled out and you go back to normal? I guess my question is, what are your thoughts on these COVID tailwinds we've seen in the second half of this year and how that continues next year and beyond? Brian McKeon : Yeah. Mike, why don't I start off, and then I'm sure Jay can weigh in on the broader trends. I think we feel we've got a very healthy growth range, as you know, for the full year on the CAG DX recurring of a 12 to 14.5. And I think the higher end of the range on top of the growth rate we had this year, we think, is a very healthy outlook for our business. I think for \u2013 we do feel good about the momentum entering the first half. I think we'll have relatively stronger growth in the first half. And I think you're highlighting the key question, which is the comparison in the second half, there was a step-up in the growth rate and driven by a number of factors, more pets, more testing, some pent-up demand that they've carried over from the early COVID impact. So I think we're just recognizing that there will be some year-over-year compare dynamics that go on that we'll learn more about as we go into the year. But I think we're \u2013 we feel very good about the momentum in the business. It was an amazing 2020, amazing recovery for the industry. And I think the \u2013 our high growth outlook reflects that. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. So I would just add to that. The logic of our guidance is linked to the market data. So we are optimistic about the outlook that the benefits will sustain. And I think Brian aptly painted the parameters of that. What we're seeing is we're seeing more pets in the marketplace. We're seeing those are driving more clinical visits, including first-time clinical visits with first-time pet parents. And veterinarians are providing more medical services beyond just the first time clinical visits. And medical services are enabled by diagnostics. You have to first diagnose before you treat. So it's a \u2013 I think it's a very healthy backdrop. And as Brian said, it is still a dynamic environment, and we'll see how it plays out. Michael Ryskin : Okay. Thanks. Can I ask a quick follow-up on that as well is you touched on the ProCyte One launch. You gave us some color on sort of the rollout in 1Q, 2Q. I'm just wondering, are you baking in any specific contribution from ProCyte One from image review for any of the product launches in 2021. And also just \u2013 could you provide a little bit more color on feedback you may have gotten from sort of the pre-launch early customers as far as how that affected your outlook for the full launch? Jay Mazelsky : Sure, I'll describe the customer experience trials, and then I'll hand it off to Brian to talk about the impact in terms of how we factored it into the forecast. The customer experience trials have done extremely well. I think customers are thrilled with not just the compact footprint but the usability and the very ease of the use of the analyzer. From that standpoint it varies the breakthrough because hematology is a complicated diagnostic testing category. And by the way, the \u2013 these customer experience trials, it's something that is best-in-class in terms of the approach that we take. You can develop an amazing analyzer but you have to put it out in real environments and environments that our customers use to get the type of feedback. We're also \u2013 the other thing that it's driving is just an increased focus on hematology, in the importance of hematology. We know many of our markets are hematology-first markets and \u2013 meaning that they place relative priority on hematology testing even before chemistry. So we're optimistic. We think it's going to be a winner for us. We think that there are over or approximately 100,000 placement opportunities on a global basis. So we're very excited about it. And Brian, why don't you describe how we factored it into our forecast? Brian McKeon : Yes. We're not breaking out specific projections by platform. But overall, Mike, we did highlight the 1% contribution to growth we expect to get from instrument revenues next year at CAG instrument revenues. And that's a very healthy growth rate that would imply kind of 20% to 30% growth in instrument revenues, and that includes, obviously, benefits from the ProCyte One launch. So we're looking forward that to being a positive net contributor, and we think we've got that built in appropriately in our outlook. Michael Ryskin : Great. Thanks so much, guys. Brian McKeon : Thank you. Operator : From Credit Suisse, we have Erin Wright. Please go ahead. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. You had some great data, obviously, on the market trends in the U.S., but I'm curious what you're seeing in international markets at this point in terms of clinical visits, new patient -- or new pet ownership, overall veterinary demand trends. Are you seeing the same level of resiliency there? And is it consistent with what you're seeing in the U.S., or what are some of the key differences between the two markets? And how are the trends in the fourth quarter and what you're anticipating into 2021 on the international side? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, I'll comment. Brian McKeon : Go ahead, Jay. Sure. Jay Mazelsky : I was going to comment -- I'll comment. I'll give you a general flavor for the international market, and then Brian, I'd ask you to provide some specifics around some of the financials. The international markets continue to be quite healthy. Even with the pullback related subsequent waves, we've seen just a modest pullback in terms of our ability to visit customers in person. But the overall markets and the overall human pet bond has -- we're seeing the same type of trends outside the U.S. as we are in the U.S. And on top of that, we continue to invest in international expansions. I mentioned three country markets that we're expanding in, and those are going extremely well. We think that there continues to be just a great opportunity to be able to tap into the expansions. The other thing that we see is the IDEXX 360 program is being nicely adopted by our European customers. So the majority of our instrument placements are now through IDEXX 360. That's also having a nice impact on our reference lab to services as part of the volume commitment aspect of that. So Brian, would you like to add any flavor to that? Brian McKeon : No, I think that captures it well. Erin, as you know, we don't have the same level of insight at the PIMS level to some of the more granular data, but I would -- we did try to point out that we had basically the same level of CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth, U.S. and internationally. Both overall regions were strong throughout the quarter. We had 20% CAG DX recurring revenue growth in Europe, Asia Pacific and higher in Latin America. And we are basically hearing the same trends and seeing the same trends in our business in terms of just vet clinics being very busy and just driven by underlying growth in utilization. So it's similar trends. I think the U.S. is particularly strong, and we have the benefit of more data and insight in the U.S., but I think it just reinforces the strong global momentum that we have in our business. Erin Wright : Okay, great. And then do you think that there's any level of pent-up demand in instrument placements more broadly? Are you anticipating stepped up instrument placements into 2021, or how should we be thinking about the trends on a quarterly basis as they potentially normalize throughout the year? Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. So we've grown Q4 placements over Q3, Q3 over Q2. The clinics, we did see some initial restrained access to the clinics early on in the pandemic, and they have these, along with social distancing policies in effect. We're still modestly impacted by that. The other thing to keep in mind is that the clinics themselves are really busy. There's just a lot of -- there's a lot of patient traffic through the clinics. So in those cases, they may not -- they may desire an instrument or a new suite, but don't want to take the time to have to interrupt practice and retrain. So, there's some headwinds connected with that. But overall, I think that our customers are responding very favorably to instruments that could help them with both capacity and productivity as well as practicing better medicine. Brian McKeon : Yes. And one factor I'd point to, I think, to reinforce Jay's point on just the clinics being busy and the demand being a driver for instruments that we feel good about going forward is just the second catalyst placements. If you see the high level of the second catalyst placements in U.S. and international markets, that's reflective of clinics trying to keep up with the higher levels of diagnostics utilization. So, I think that's a positive factor. And we're still working through some of the access headwinds, but I think the general trend has been positive for us. Erin Wright : Great. Thank you. Operator : From Goldman Sachs, we have Nathan Rich. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Good morning Jay and Brian. Thanks for the questions. Maybe just to start on the CAG Dx guidance. Going back to -- I think it was the first question. And the spread that you expect this year kind of narrowing back to the 9% to 10% range from the 12% that you saw this year, how much of that reflects potential conservatism, I guess? Because it seems like a lot of the trends that you saw driving frequency and utilization of diagnostics should continue. So, are there any other factors that we should just kind of keep in mind as we think about that's right kind of going back towards the historical range? Brian McKeon : Nate, I think it's primarily just reflecting the lapping of the step-up in growth, particularly in the second half. If you look at the premium that we're trying to use, the shorthand ways of looking at it, but in the U.S., the premium of CAG Dx recurring growth to clinical visit growth, it was about 1,600 basis points in Q3. It was about 1,200 basis points in Q4. And so I think there -- some of that, I think the Q3 benefited from pent-up demand. And so I think we're seeing some normalization from that dynamic. And as we get into 2021, we expect -- we do have a very healthy clinical visit growth rate projected and continued strong growth, but I think just recognizing that we had some step-ups here in the demand that, I think, is driving us. The 900 to 1,000 premium, we think, is an excellent premium and I think would position us very well for strong growth moving forward. But those are some of the factors we built in. Nathan Rich : Makes sense. And then just, Brian, quickly, if I could follow up on your comments on sort of the cadence of revenue growth in 2021. Understand it will probably be stronger in the first half than the second. I guess if we think about sort of the current trends continuing into the first quarter, it seems like the CAG Dx recurring growth should be in that 20% range. That would mean sort of the back half of the year is high single-digits to 10%. Is that roughly the right way to think about the cadence of growth between the first half and the second half of the year? Brian McKeon : Yes, without getting to specifics on projections, because we're not going to be doing quarterly projections, and there's going to be a lot of noise in the quarters, as you know, Nate, maybe we had the beginning of COVID in Q1 and more meaningful impacts in Q2, and so things like the rebound in Q3, so I think year-over-year, the quarters are going to be a little bumpy. But directionally, yes. I think we're expecting that higher level of growth in the first half. And given the year-over-year step-up in growth, more moderate growth rates in the second half is what's implied in our guidance range. And so we'll see how the world -- the markets play out. It's still a very dynamic environment, as you might imagine, to try to forecast them. There's a lot of unknowns here just with the -- how the pandemic plays out and how those factors evolve as, hopefully, people get back to work and lives get back to normal. But I think that directionally, that's how we're thinking about it. Nathan Rich : Great. Thank you. Operator : From Stifel, we have Jon Block. Please go ahead. Jon Block : Thanks guys. Good morning. Maybe first one, Brian, just the CAG recurring acceleration, the acceleration of around 100 to 200 bps, I think it's 13.25 at the mid-point versus pre-COVID levels. Just running some high-level math, it seems like another $30 million to $40 million incremental high margin revenue. And so can you just talk about, as specific as you're willing to get, where you're allocating the incremental gross profit dollars? We talk a lot about the flow-through from the CAG recurring. And, obviously, we're seeing that as that some of these U.S. international investments. And if so, do you think it just puts you guys in a stronger position as we look out in subsequent years? And then I've got a follow-up. Brian McKeon : Well, just to start, to your last point, Jon, I think you've got high CAG recurring diagnostic revenue growth. That's a very good dynamic for our business from a profit point of view and a gross profit expansion point of view. And so that is, clearly, a key driver of our performance in recent years and particularly in 2020. Just in terms of dynamics going into 2021, we do anticipate some investments in areas like lab capacity. We're trying to keep up with the very strong growth that we've seen. I'd point out that 2020 was an unusual year in that we -- early on, when we really didn't know how this was going to play out, we erred on the side, I would say, of caution and just been very tight with our costs controls last year and wanted to ensure that we had a healthy business model and asked people to make sacrifices. There were a lot that went into that. And so we're trying to reflect that we've got year-over-year compares here to a year that we had a high level of cost control, and we're going to have some investments that are coming back across the business, and we expect to try to highlight there's going to be things like health care costs and perhaps travel costs and things like that, that come back later in the year and as well as just trying to reengage and investing in areas that we held the line on in 2020 and had very high growth. So we've noted things like international commercial expansion as an area that we want to lean in. We want to continue to support our R&D agenda. And so the number of areas that are all aligned with our organic growth strategy that we're intending to support it, and that's reflected in our intent to have moderate operating margin gains on top of very strong performance. So we're committed to building on the performance but recognizing that we have some pent-up demand here, if you will, for investments in the business. Jon Block : Yeah. Okay, got it. Very helpful. And then second question, goes down the same road that I think maybe went down to Mike as well, but I'll ask it a little bit differently, I think certainly differently. So you're guiding to an acceleration in the CAG recurring at 13.25 mid-point, and you've been around 11% to 12%, but it seems that the acceleration per your commentary is a function of greater expectations around clinical visits versus your premium to the clinical, right? With your premium to the clinical, you expect around that 900 bp to 1,000 bp premium. And so can you talk to that dynamic, guys? I would just think at a high level, the premium would be more in your control with the increased commercial investments, the innovation driving utilizations versus that, and trying to sort of guesstimate how the underlying clinical visit shakes out. So, why one versus -- you might end up in the same place, but I'm just curious why the premium would be unchanged and you feel more comfortable with the sort of high levels of clinical visit growth. Jon Block : Thanks guys. Jay Mazelsky : So, let me try to frame this up, Jon. So, there's a number of different factors that I think are driving growth. First off, there's more pets. We've talked about that and the majority being puppies and kittens, and that clearly has an impact. It's hard to get your arms around exactly what that impact is, but we provided some guidance in the past. Then there's more clinical visits even beyond the new pets. And for these clinical visits, we know that there's more clinical visits that are being used to provide medical services that include both higher use and intensity of diagnostics. And I think to your point, that's the piece that we can control through innovation and our commercial strategies and customer-friendly marketing program. So, that's where our focus is on being able to really drive that awareness and education and adoption by the veterinary customer to deliver better medical care. And I think we've provided some ranges in terms of what that looks like. And it's a very healthy market backdrop, and that's where our focus is. Brian McKeon : I think we have time for one more question. Operator : And our last question from JPMorgan, we have Chris Schott. Please go ahead. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much. Just two fairly quick ones here. Just on that topic of new pet growth. I think you referred to about 10% in 2020. How are you envisioning 2021 playing out? Is this another year of very healthy pet growth, or do you expect as we kind of go through the year, the world starts to normalize a bit, that we may be moderate back down to that 3% or so rate that we've seen historically? And then my second one was just given all the favorable trends that played out in 2020, are you making changes about how you think about promotion and commercial approach to lock in these dynamics? So, I know you've got a lot of initiatives that you've talked about to continue to grow the business. But have you changed what you're emphasizing or how you're approaching the vet just given what we learned about the kind of pet owner and willingness to spend over the last year or so? Thanks so much. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. So, just to answer, so that 10% was new pet clinical growth versus new total pet growth in the marketplace and we think that, that's a healthy dynamic because they initially come into the practice as puppies and kittens. They make their initial checkup, which includes diagnostic tests. And to speak to your second point, the two are really related. If we do our job well with Preventive Care programs and other programs that those puppies and kittens as they become dogs and cats, continue to get care on an annual basis or twice a year. So, we think it's a healthy dynamic and plays into our strengths, both as a commercial and marketing strategy. The programs we actually have in place are ideally suited to drive that. So, if you think about the Preventive Care program that we have 4,800-plus customers enroll in that, that's a great example of a driver of medical services and, in turn, diagnostics usage. So, our programs are geared towards driving education and adoption of both wellness and non-wellness type care and testing. So we think we're very aligned, and we think it's a trend that we can sustain, and that's the plan to be able to do that. Jay Mazelsky : So I think that's the last question. I want to thank everybody for calling in. I know we have some employees who are also on the call. And I just want to express my gratitude for their extraordinary performance during these challenging times. We run the company in a way that takes a long-term view of the opportunities ahead of us while still delivering today. I couldn't be more appreciative of the IDEXX team and the purpose, which animates our work. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining, and you may now disconnect at this time. Thank you.",

We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we will take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our first quarter result and to provide an update on our initial financial outlook for 2021. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered excellent financial results in Q1, driven by continued strong global momentum in our CAG business. Revenue increased 24% as reported and 21% organically supported by 23% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting continued high gains across U.S. and international markets. The operating profit gains were particularly strong in Q1, reflecting flow-through benefits from high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth and favorable comparisons to relatively higher prior year pre-COVID operating expense levels. These dynamics and a higher than expected $0.17 per share in stock based compensation tax benefit enabled delivery of $2.35 in earnings per share, an increase of 73% on a comparable basis. Our strong start to the year has increased our comp and has been achieving high revenue and profit gains in 2021. We're raising our full-year revenue outlook range by 40 million to $3,105 million to $3,160 million, or reported revenue growth of 14.5% to 16.5%. This reflects an updated outlook for 13% to 15% overall organic revenue growth, 1.5% higher than our initial outlook. We're raising our organic growth outlook for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues to 14.5% to 16%, 2% higher at mid-point than our initial 2021 growth projections. Our full-year financial outlook now reflects a targeted 150 basis point to 200 basis point improvement in operating margins on a comparable basis. These gains are projected to support EPS of $7.88 to $8.18 per share, reflecting 21% to 26% comparable EPS growth. We're planning to deliver these strong profit gains while advancing investments in our innovation and commercial capability to enable long-term accelerated global market development in our core CAG business. We'll update or we'll discuss our updated 2020 outlook later my comments. Let's begin with a review of our first quarter results in recent market trends. First quarter organic revenue growth of 21% was driven by 23% gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting 21% growth in the U.S. and 28% growth in international markets, including some benefits from the lapping of prior year COVID impacts in late March. Strong CAG gains also reflected 27% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues. Overall, Q1 organic revenue gains were supported by 9% growth in our LPD business, reflecting strong demand for African Swine Fever testing in China, as well as by approximately 1% of growth benefit from our OPTI human COVID-19 PCR test initiative. The key driver of our financial model CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues expanded the high growth rates across regions through the quarter. First quarter results were largely consistent with the very strong two-year growth trends we saw on the second half of 2020. On a two-year basis, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased at a 70% average annual organic growth rate. We'll be highlighting two-year growth trends selectively in the coming quarters as we calibrate the effect of year-on-year lapping of 2020 COVID impacts on our growth results. High CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains were aided by continued high growth in clinical visits. Overall, U.S. clinical visit growth was 12% in Q1; including some benefits from the lapping of prior year COVID impacts in late March. On a two-year basis, same store clinical visit growth increased at an average 6% annual rate, slightly higher than our second half 2020 trends. The IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits was 900 basis points in the first quarter, or approximately 1,000 basis points to 1,100 basis points adjusted for [equivalent day effects]. Q1 U.S. clinic visit growth reflected sustained strong 9% growth in non-wellness visits and an increased 16% growth in wellness visits. These gains were supported by relatively higher benefits from growth in new patients, which we estimated added approximately 3% to overall clinical visit growth, and 4% to wellness visit growth in the quarter. Our continued focus on expanded pet healthcare services, including increases in the utilization of diagnostics supported a 15% same-store increase and overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q1 and a 21% same store increase in diagnostic revenues for practice, well ahead of 5% growth in overall visits to veterinary clinics in the quarter. Positive market dynamics benefits from IDEXX commercial initiatives and technology to support higher standards of care and continued very high customer retention rates drove strong Q1 organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities globally. IDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 22% organically in Q1, reflecting 20% plus organic gains in U.S. and international markets. Our international reference lab gains benefited from strong growth in Europe, supported by our new German core lab capability, our expanded commercial presence, and growth in IDEXX 360 program agreements. Global reference lab gains continued to be driven by high same store volume growth with strong gains across testing categories. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 26% on an organic basis in the first quarter, reflecting continued 20% plus growth in the U.S. and 30% plus organic gains in international markets. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels, and expansion of our global premium instrument install base. CAG instrument placements increased significantly in Q1 compared to constrain prior levels as clinics look ahead to supporting high growth in demand for diagnostics globally. Total premium placements increased 32%, reflecting 26% gains in North America, and 36% growth in international markets. The quality of CAG instrument placements was excellent reflected in 302 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 27%, and 805 new and competitive placements in international markets, a year-on-year [increase of 15%]. We also benefited from 464 second Catalyst placements driven by continued strong demand from high volume customers. These new placements and high customer retention levels supported a 13% year-on-year growth in our global Catalyst installed base. We achieved 956 premium hematology placements, including our initial shipments of ProCyte One supporting a 10% growth in our global premium hematology base compared to Q1 of 2020. We also placed 577 SediVue\u2019s including strong placement levels at international markets leveraging IDEXX 360 agreements, which supported a 21% year-on-year global increase in our [premium earned in settlement] installed base. We're very encouraged by the momentum we drive in expanding our in-clinic installed base as we prepare for continued improvement and sales access to veterinary clinics globally, and advanced the global launch of ProCyte One. Rapid assay revenues also expanded a strong 20% organic growth rate in Q1, reflecting mid-teen gains in the U.S., supported by high demand for wellness testing, and accelerated growth in international markets. Of note, retention rates for U.S. rapid asset customers reached 97% in Q1, the highest level seen since the initiation of our U.S. go direct effort since 2014. Overall, high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume driven across our modalities, with consistent overall net price gains of 2% to 3%. In other areas of our CAD business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 9% organically overall. Double-digit gains in recurring software and digital imaging service revenues and solid growth and new software system placements were moderated by lower diagnostic imaging instrument revenue levels, impacted by a year-on-year reduction in early regeneration instrument platform sales. Turning to our other business segments, water business revenues declined 3% organically in Q1, compared to strong prior year results, which included an estimated $2 million or 8% growth benefit from accelerated stocking orders. Adjusting for these impacts, water revenues increased solidly year-on-year as we continue to see relative improvement and non-compliance related testing volumes that have been constrained during the pandemic. Livestock poultry and dairy revenue increased 9% organically in Q1, driven by growth in our Asia Pacific region. Q1 results saw approximately 2 million of favorability from shipment timing, which largely offset favorable shipment timing impacts of Q1 of 2020. LPD results benefited from strong demand for diagnostic testing programs for African swine fever and growth in core swine testing volumes in [China], supported by large producer efforts to rebuild swine herds. These gains more than offset lower herd health screening levels, compared to strong prior year results. We expect to see some pressure in our LPD revenue growth rate moving forward, particularly in the second half of this year as we begin to lap the benefits from high prior demand for African swine fever testing programs and see increased levels of local competition in China. Turning to the P&L, we had strong profit flow through in Q1 as we benefited from high CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains and comparisons to relatively higher pre-COVID operating expense levels in the first quarter of 2020. Overall operating margins expanded 830 basis points year-on-year on a comparable basis, driving an increase in operating profits of 72% as reported and 65% on a comparable basis. Gross profit increased 31% in Q1. Gross margins increased 320 basis points on a comparable basis, reflecting productivity improvement in our lab operations, supported by higher organic revenue growth, favorable impacts from strong consumable sales, and benefits from moderate net price gains. We\u2019re planning for gross margin gains to moderate over the balance of this year as we [lab tightly] controlled prior spending levels at increased reference lab staffing to support high revenue growth and service levels. Operating expenses in Q1 increased 4% as reported, and 3% on a comparable basis. As noted, operating expense growth was moderated by comparisons to higher prior year pre-COVID spending levels, including much higher prior year first quarter travel, trade show, and sales meeting costs. Our 2020 financial outlook includes expectations for an increased rate of OpEx growth moving forward, as we lap comparisons to control prior year OpEx levels, and invest to support our strong global growth momentum through enhancements to our commercial and innovation capability. We're also planning for year-on-year increases in costs in key areas such as employee health care claims and travel costs as we work through the year in pandemic related restrictions are raised. Q1 EPS was $2.35 per share, including benefits of 15 million or $0.17 per share related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable basis, Q1 EPS increased 73%. Foreign exchange added 10 million to operating profits and $0.09 to EPS in Q1, net of approximately $2 million in hedge losses. Free cash flow was 104 million in Q1. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 99%, including benefits from delayed capital spending, an extension of tax payments. For the full-year, we're maintaining a consistent outlook for free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90% of net income. Our balance sheet remains in a very strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.0 times gross and 0.6 times net of cash, [the] 350 million in cash and no borrowings and a $1 billion revolving credit facility. We re-initiated share repurchases in Q1 allocating 154 million of capital to repurchase 305,000 shares. Turning to our 2021 full-year outlook, we're increasing our projected ranges for overall revenue growth to 14.5% to 16.5%, as reported. This reflects at 150 basis point increase in our projected organic revenue growth range offset by approximately $5 million and refinements to our FX assumptions, which now point to a positive 1.5% full-year growth benefit this year, at the rate shared in our press release. Our updated organic, overall organic revenue growth outlook of 13% to 15% reflects an estimated organic growth range of 14.5% to 16% for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue. As noted, we've raised the CAG DX recurring revenue growth outlook by 2% at midpoint to reflect our strong Q1 results, trends that point towards a sustained high rate of U.S. clinic visit growth, and confidence in our global CAG commercial execution, which is driving strong momentum in our international regions. As a benchmark, our updated recurring revenue growth outlook aligns with the higher end of our earlier projections for 2% to 5% same store U.S. clinic clinical visit growth for the full-year 2021 and an expected premium of IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth to clinic visit growth of approximately 900 basis to 1,000 basis points. The increase in our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook, which results in over 50 million of operational revenue [upside] is being moderated by relatively more conservative full-year projections for IDEXX [human COVID] testing. We estimate that we'll see approximately $10 million in lower human COVID revenues year-on-year in the second half of 2021 as we lap the benefits of our prior year initiatives and plan for moderation and testing levels. We've also moderated our outlook for LPD growth to reflect to increase local competition in China, including \u2013 and our African swine fever testing business. Combined, these effects resulted in 0.5% headwind, compared to earlier overall 20 2021 organic growth outlook. Given the lapping of prior year COVID impacts, there will likely be significant variability in year-on-year revenue growth rates by quarter, with continued expectations for higher revenue growth in the first half of 2021. In terms of key financial metrics, as noted, we're now targeting 150 basis points to 200 basis points of annual comparable operating margin improvement in 2021, up 100 basis points from our initial outlook. This is reflected in a reported operating margin outlook for 2021 of 28.3% to 28.8%. Our EPS outlook incorporates updated projections for foreign exchange, which we now estimate will provide $0.15 of positive EPS benefit in 2021, net of established hedged positions. Our full-year outlook also includes an updated estimate of $0.19 per share of tax benefit related to share based compensation activity, $0.09 per share higher than our initial projections. We provided details and our updated estimates in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Jay Mazelsky : Thanks, Brian and good morning. IDEXX had an excellent start to 2021, driven by continued strong market trends in our core CAG business and strong execution. This resulted in 21% quarterly organic revenue growth in the first quarter and high profit flow through supported by 23% organic growth for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. There were strong gains across all our market segments. Our business performance reinforces the tremendous long-term opportunity we seek to develop the global market for companion animal health care, and gives us confidence to raise our 2021 outlook, just a little over 14.5% to 16% organic growth for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, and 21% to 26% gains in comparable EPS growth. Today, I'll provide an update on the trends we're seeing in our companion animal markets. And our approach to drive accelerated market growth, leveraging IDEXX, innovation to raise the standard of patient care. I\u2019ll also provide an update on our product and commercial initiatives that will enable us to capitalize our market tailwinds and position the company to deliver continued strong financial returns. Let's begin with an update on market trends.  Companion animal healthcare continues to see strong global market momentum. This is reflected, for example, in U.S. market data showing higher growth in clinical visits, and continued high growth in services supported by expanded utilization of diagnostics. As Brian highlighted, we saw continued high U.S. clinic visit growth, up 12% in the quarter with non-wellness visits up 9% and wellness visits up 16%, with strong growth seen across practices of all sizes. New patients continue to be a significant contributor to critical visit gains. We estimate that new clinical patients added approximately 3% to overall clinical growth versus Q1 2020, up from 1% to 2% in the second half of 2020. And we continue to see record levels in progesterone testing, evidence of a continued step up in breeder activity. The growth in puppies and kittens and continued evidence of the deepening of the pet owner bond, augmented by the growth in new pet parents can provide long-term tailwinds for our business. As a benchmark, we estimate that the average annual diagnostic revenue per senior or geriatric pet is double the amount we see per pet for puppies and kittens. If we do our job well with programs like preventive care, we can help to drive twice the level of annual visits in young well pets and continue to expand diagnostics usage through life stages, thereby helping advanced standards of care.  In looking at our U.S. market data, we've seen an acceleration in the utilization of diagnostics. In our earnings snapshot, we shared annual data for the percentage of 2020 clinical visits, including Bloodwork. The percentage of clinical visits with Bloodwork increased approximately 1% to 18% in 2020, double the historical rate of annual increase.  Interestingly, the highest increases were in customer [indiscernible] doing more testing. With gains across wellness and non-wellness Bloodwork utilization, reinforcing the point that even the highest users of diagnostics has significant potential for further growth. In increased focus on services and adoption of higher standards of care in areas like diagnostics are driving very strong overall growth and veterinary clinics. In the first quarter, same store total practice revenues increased 15% versus the same quarter last year, reflecting a 19% growth in clinical revenue per practice, and 21% growth in diagnostics revenues. Clearly, our customers are extremely busy. It's not surprising that they are looking for help from partners like IDEXX to support their high levels of business growth through our customer centric solutions offering. We're particularly pleased with our commercial execution to support these customer needs evidenced by 32% year-over-year growth in premium instrument placements globally, including strong growth and placement in new and competitive accounts. A key area focus has been leveraging our integrated direct go-to-market model to accelerate international growth. We achieved 28% CAG Diagnostics recurrent organic revenue growth internationally in Q1 with strong gains across all our major regions, while driving a 36% year-over-year increase in premium instrument placements outside of North America, despite continued restrictions and sales access to clinics. IDEXX 360 continues to gain traction internationally, resulting in higher growth with customers leveraging IDEXX technology across modalities. IDEXX 360 is helping to accelerate growth in our international reference labs and key markets like Europe, supported by our state of the art, new core lab in Kornwestheim, Germany, and our expanded commercial presence. The International commercial expansion efforts we've highlighted continued to progress the plan with a goal of completing on-boarding of new sales teams in key markets in the first half of 2021. The outstanding growth momentum and long-term potential for IDEXX and international markets reinforces the high return from investments in our global commercial capability. Advancing international commercial expansions will continue to be a key strategy. Innovation is another key pillar in our growth strategy. In late March, we reached an exciting milestone when we began shipments of our next generation hematology analyzer ProCyte One. I\u2019m was very proud of the extended team, including our Westbrook, Maine based instrument manufacturing personnel for delivering this world-class analyzer on schedule during a pandemic, to the delight of our customers. Our first sales and installations were to U.S. clinics that participated in our customer experience trials, which is a testament to their highly positive experience with the analyzer. ProCyte One\u2019s exceptional simplicity and accuracy give our customers confidence in running the analyzer and in the patient results. This is helping to gain efficiencies and practices in this truly at best-in-class experience. ProCyte One also represents the next step for IDEXX in providing leading edge technology integrated with information management, which enables clinical decision support and supports a wide range of veterinarian partners in providing the highest levels of care. We expect ProCyte One to drive CAG growth as chemistry and hematology testing go hand-in-hand and as part of the IDEXX 360 program to help drive reference lab usage. This quarter, our commercial focus for ProCyte One is on shipment to the clinics that took advantage of our pre-sales program, while concurrently manufacturing and building volume to support our [sales rep] through 2021, including the international rollout expected to begin in late Q2, early Q3. The [SNAP Pro instrument] is another investment in innovation that supports our customers at the point of care by providing workflow benefits, accurate reading of diagnostic results on the SNAP Platform, a smart service connectivity. Our veterinary partners are busier than ever, so providing ease of information management within the practice is a key benefit to help them save precious time, while maintaining accurate records. SNAP Pro provides a tool to address these needs and does help drive recent growth internationally for our rapid assay business. We see high engagement from international customers who are actively using SNAP Pro and are connected to smart service with growth and retention rates consistent with trends across U.S. customers. We're also making excellent progress in expanding our installed base in key geographic markets like Europe, which help to drive 20% organic growth in global rapid assay revenues in the first quarter. Our innovation agenda is also driving favorable business performance for our software portfolio, which had another excellent quarter. Record breaking worldwide PIMS placements in the quarter grew 43% versus Q1 of last year. With two [indiscernible] PIMS placements driven by cloud based technology. IDEXX Web PACS saw double-digit growth in subscribers, including improvements in customer retention levels over 96%. We received consistent praise from subscribers about usability, value, and support to the Web PACS system. Important feedback as we look to expand this product into new markets. These integrated offerings together create a diversified technology stack that provides multiple customer benefits to help manage the growing productivity demands of veterinary clinics in a high growth market. Through our PIMS tools, through our PIMS and tools like SmartFlow, our focus is on improving clinic workflow by seamlessly connecting data between devices to streamline every step from patient admission to discharge. By bringing AI capability to tools like Web PACS, our platforms enable faster procedures, while leveraging data to deliver insights and reduce efforts by clinic staff. Extending to the client, our communication applications are more compelling than ever with clinics managing a significant portion of visits curbside. Connected software is critical for clinics in creating capacity to meet the increasing demands for veterinary services. IDEXX is uniquely positioned to serve customer needs in this area, enhancing our value proposition and differentiation. In terms of our key initiatives, we continue to promote the advancement of preventive care in annual wellness testing to the IDEXX preventive care program. In addition to increasing the standard of patient care, preventive care programs can help veterinarians improve practice capacity, to more predictable schedule, and level loading of practice staff. In the first quarter, the commercial team executed over 200 new enrollments, bringing total enrollments to over 5,000, which is an exciting milestone, as we are more than halfway to our goal of 10,000 enrolled customers in the U.S. by 2024. As our customers enter the wellness testing season, and wellness visits accelerated in the market, we are focused on continuing to capture the underdeveloped market opportunity in Vector-borne disease testing. There are significant long-term opportunities to expand Vector-borne disease testing in particular, given the current prevalence of heartworm only testing in the U.S. Shifting its balance to a full Vector-borne disease screening using 40x plus not only enhances the standard of care, it represents a material opportunity for clinics to drive additional revenue. This focus in strong underlying market trends help to deliver double-digit revenue growth across all regions, led by increases in utilization of 40x plus and fee-line retrovirus tests. As we look ahead, we're very excited about the opportunity to leverage our commercial capability, innovation in partnerships with our customers to build on our strong growth trends. A key area of focus for us is to continue to invest in the infrastructure necessary to meet high levels of growth, while maintaining top notch service levels in prioritizing support for our workforce. Our employees and customers have shown high levels of adaptability and resiliency during continued COVID-related restrictions. And we look forward to a post-COVID-19 environment. We anticipate more flexibility in the future, and leveraging new ways of working together with our colleagues and customers. I'd like to add that I'm extremely proud of the way that the IDEXX team is executing. We're on track for strong 2021. That concludes my opening remarks. And we now have time for some questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Michael Ryskin from Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : Hey, thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the strong quarter guys. To start, I want to ask on, I want to focus on some of the OpEx side of things, obviously, a gray quarter here. And on the margin side and coming out of the gate, but Brian and Jay, you both had comments in you prepared remarks sort of on how to manage spend going forward, both from the fact that you're going to be lapping some easier comps, but also that you want to invest into the growth in the business. I think you mentioned, you know, adding on some staffing on the reference lab side. Could you expand on that a little bit? And is there anything on the [CAG feel based] personnel, just sort of how should we think about, you know, reinvesting some of the gains the business to support the growth for the rest of the year. Brian McKeon : Mike, why don't I start by, just kind of, framing the comparisons that we're trying to highlight as we move forward, because that's a key dynamic? We're just trying to reinforce. Clearly we had very strong profit results in Q1. We are going to start entering a period here where we're going to be comparing ourselves to the control spending levels that we implemented last year. So, if you recall, we had 25 million of OpEx savings that we highlighted second quarter, another 5 million of savings from lower health care costs. We really, in the early stages of the pandemic tried to be very mindful of how we're controlling labor costs in areas like the labs, and so we're just trying to highlight as we move forward.  We're going to see, you know, some of those comparison effects moderate the margin gains, the gross margin gains, and we'll see relatively higher OpEx growth. Again, as a benchmark just in Q1, we had over $7 million of cost reduction year-on-year from things like lower sales meeting costs [in T&E], which is about 7% of OpEx growth. So, moving forward, we won't have those kind of favorability. So, we're just trying to highlight that. And we're also trying to highlight that we're advancing investment in the business. So, maybe Jay can talk a bit about that. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, sure. So, just a couple things to build on Brian's comments. Obviously, we're in a high growth environment, there's excellent opportunity to continue to support that growth. We do that, obviously, in areas like reference labs and production, and field support. And the other area of opportunity for us is just our international markets. We've identified this as being very attractive and we continue to advance our expansions where it makes sense. We know that there's pretty good short-term return on those expansions. We have, I think, really optimized our ability to identify all the right pieces you need to have in place, including additional field, personnel, reference labs, information technology, investments, those type of things. So, we're very optimistic about the opportunity, short-term and long-term in our markets, U.S., as well as international and will continue to advances as we see opportunities before us. Michael Ryskin : Great, thanks. And then if I could throw on a follow up, sort of on some of the underlying figures you provide for market conditions, as always, the snapshot is very helpful in terms of visit growth and revenue growth for practices. I'm just curious, you know, looking at it on one more granularity, it seems like you're actually seeing continued acceleration from 4Q, you know, both on a raw number spaces and even if you adjust for some of the comp, I think, I guess I would say that we were expecting a little bit more moderation and maybe a gradual phase as you go through the year. But it seems like there's no indication of that. Is that a fair analysis of the data? Have you seen anything that would indicate that things are moderating a little bit as some of these markets, sort of come out from COVID, and we're seeing some reopening of the economy? Just wondered if you could talk about, sort of the underlying trends there? Brian McKeon : I would say, overall, Mike, the theme would be more consistency than change. What we saw in 2020 was an improvement. If you break down the drivers of things like CAG Diagnostic revenue growth in the clinic, we saw higher levels of contribution from frequency and utilization, and those have sustained. If there was one thing that improved a bit in Q1, which we highlighted in the comments was the new patient contribution to clinical visit growth was up about 100 basis points. So, I think some of the, you know, the building effect of the new puppies and kittens helped, but, you know, adjusting for that the two-year growth rates were largely consistent with Q4. It was more consistency than change. We're entering a period now where we'll have the, you know, the COVID compares, you know, because, you know, the growth rate numbers are a little tougher to follow. So, we're trying to highlight some of the two year trends. And, you know, I think we're encouraged that the two-year trends are holding up well, and you know, that's factored into our outlook for the balance of the year. Jay Mazelsky : I would just add to that Mike. The trends we described, the broader level trends we've described have largely been intact. So, these are obviously new critical business growth driven by new patients. The majority of which are puppies and kittens, higher usage and intensity of diagnostics and more of a pivot to services by the veterinarians. For those that we have seen over the last, you know, second half of 2020, we continue to see in Q1. Brian McKeon : One thing I\u2019d highlight in addition to the market trends is, in terms of IDEXX\u2019s execution, our international teams are really doing an excellent job. We had excellent instrument placements, you know, growth in 360. I think the global commercial model that we've been looking to leverage and build upon is really, really in a good place. And we're very pleased with the international momentum. So, we wanted to highlight that. Operator : Our next question is from Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. So, you gave some incremental charts in the snapshot this time where the percentage of clinical visits, including the Bloodwork increased by 1%. So that seems like an acceleration from the prior trends even seen on an annual basis, but was this driven mostly by the greater proportion of acute visits during the pandemic? And how should we be thinking about that acceleration continuing with potentially greater adoption of preventative care measures, as well as other initiatives in a post pandemic world? Jay Mazelsky : I'll make a couple comments about that, Erin. So the use of Bloodwork has \u2013 the growth rate has approximately doubled as we talked about a percent in 2020 and versus about 0.5% the previous year. And so there's a number of things that are driving that. We've seen greater proportion of the higher users of diagnostics continue to increase. And we see that very optimistically, as evidence that even those who were at the higher range from a [dead cell] standpoint of diagnostic users feel like there's a lot more capacity. We also see \u2013 as part of clinical visits, greater use of diagnostics, and then when they use them, greater intensity has also gone up. So, all those factors are playing into it. And we think that they'll sustain three plus quarters. Erin Wright : Okay, great and then on ProCyte One, can you provide an update on traction there? Do you anticipate that accelerating throughout the year and how is that tracking relative to your internal expectations at this point? Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, we're very excited and optimistic about ProCyte One. It's been a very successful roll-out. There things \u2013 there's a time and distance dimension to these, you know, as we roll-out a new analyzer in terms of building volume in production, create awareness, in the marketplace. You know, the exciting thing about ProCyte One is the opportunity itself is very significant. We think that there are 100,000 plus opportunities for placements in the hematology market, but there's also a nice multiplier impact where if there's hematology, there's chemistry. So, we tend to place those together. There's, as part of IDEXX 360 there's pull-through in terms of, you know, the reference labs and rapid essay, not just the U.S. now, but internationally. And so, we're excited by the opportunity. I think our experience, our customer experience trials have given us a lot of confidence that the analyzer has hit the mark, both in terms of usability and performance, and we expect our ramp to grow throughout the year. And especially, so internationally as we release late Q2, early Q3 pending on things like regulatory approvals. Erin Wright : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jon Block from Stifel. Jon Block : Thanks, good morning. Maybe two questions from me. Brian, the first one's a little long both for you. I think a level of year-over-year gross margin expansion, I think you said you expect the year-over-year level to moderate, but just to be clear, does it stay in this, you know, low 60% range? And then on the balance sheet, the leverage, I think you call that 0.6 net. That might be the lowest level I can remember since you came in the CFO and started to flex it a bit. You've got a couple of big CapEx build-outs. It's now behind you in Germany, and Westbrook. So, just maybe you can comment on how we think about cap deployment going forward? And then I just got a quick follow-up. Brian McKeon : Yeah. On your first question on gross margin, we are seeing a really nice flow through and obviously the high CAG DX recurring mix and just the strong growth were is helping, we do anticipate, Jon, we're going to be adding back some costs here to keep up with the growth, particularly in things like lab staffing. And then we'll have, you know, some compares just to the, as I mentioned on a year-over-year basis, but we're still anticipating a high level of gross margin flow through and that's factored into our outlook. And on leverage, you're correct, we've, you know, we're quite disciplined last year in terms of pausing, share repurchases, and really controlling our capital spending. Our capital spending on an annual basis was below, kind of the normal levels that we typically have. And we deferred some projects. And we're \u2013 you will see a step up in that as we move forward, not a change fundamentally in our long-term view, but just, you know, catching up on some of the deferred capital spending. And right now, we're just signaling maintaining the kind of net leverage ratios that you see. We did initiate buybacks in Q1, and feel good about sustaining those. So \u2013 but not trying to signal any change to the leverage profile at this point. Jon Block : Okay. Got it. Very helpful then. Huge quarter, but we got to try to anticipate some of the potential push back. And the only thing that I can try to identify is, you mentioned the 900 basis, point U.S. CAG recurring premium to clinical visit growth, you know, that's down from the 1,600 and 1,200 premium I n 3Q and 4Q 2020, respectively, I think you said they adjusted it was closer to 1,000 or 1,100 bips, but any thoughts on why that slight moderation? You know, Jay, maybe in light of the Vets, as you mentioned, still focusing a lot more on services at their practices? And how do we think about the premium going forward, is it still in that 1,000 bip range? Thanks, guys. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, you know, Jon, there's always a little bit of variability from quarter-to-quarter. We think that 900 plus, you know premium is, it's what we've seen over the last quarters in 2020 and we think that that is sustainable. I think it's a reflection of a couple of different things. Obviously, the pivot to services, which if anything has accelerated as part of the COVID response in clinics, but it's also in response that our strategy as a company around innovation, the commercial partnership with our customers in bringing testing relevant testing practices.  And so, we think that that's a successful formula. And it's supportive of what veterinarians and pet owners want to see in terms of better patient care, better \u2013 higher standards of care for patients. And that will continue to be a focus for us from a commercial and innovation strategy standpoint. Brian McKeon : And Jon, Jon, one thing I'd highlight too, I know you're looking quarter-by-quarter, but Q3, I think you need to factor in there. There was some pent-up demand likely effects and so I think the overall trend is very healthy. It\u2019s at the higher-end of our outlook. It's above where it was pre-COVID. We feel very good about the growth and services trend as being sustainable to something that's going to, you know enhance our growth profile. Operator : Our next question is from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. I actually wanted to start with the follow-up to John's question on the CAG DX guidance. Brian, I think you said it was up 2%, relative to the prior outlook. I would just be curious to get some more details on the underlying assumptions around visit growth and increases in diagnostic utilization. I think you had talked about, kind of 2% to 5% visit growth for the year previously, and then that 9% to 10% premium that was just referenced. So, I\u2019d just be curious if you have any, kind of updated assumptions, as we think about the balance of the year on those metrics? Brian McKeon : Sure. [Indiscernible] started a little higher level with the global numbers, but made our \u2013 our updated range, the higher-end of the CAG DX recurring range, basically assumed similar two year growth trends to what we saw in Q4 and Q1. So, it's largely in-line with that. And I think that, that is the primary driver of the update. I think is the \u2013 just, you know, more competence coming through Q1 on sustainability of some of the trends and some positive dynamics with critical visit growth. And so that's more of the headline. We're still maintaining, you know, a range, because that may moderate. You know, we may see some pullback. We're going to be up against some compares here. But I think, on balance, we feel very good about the trends. And if anything, they improved a bit in Q1. And as a benchmark, we do try to highlight that U.S. clinical visit growth, and premium dynamic that you mentioned and our initial estimates were 2% to 5% for the full-year. For clinical visit growth, that's a one-year basis and the 900 basis point to 1,000 basis point premium.  And I did mention that our updated outlook reflects that we're trending at the higher-end on clinical visits. And that we're reinforcing the premium outlook, which is right in-line with where we were in Q1. So, you know, I think the, you know, just the underlying market trends have sustained. We feel good about that, and we are seeing that globally. And I think we feel very good about our execution. And now of course have things like ProCyte One to innovation issues that'll help us build on that momentum. Nathan Rich : Great, that's helpful. If I could just ask a quick follow up on ProCyte One, you know, can you talk about, I guess, maybe Jay, you know, the placements that you've seen so far or maybe the orders that you're getting, you know, how many of those are in new or competitive accounts versus with existing customers? And can you maybe just talk about the opportunity to use, kind of ProCyte One as maybe a lever to get into practices that IDEXX is in currently? Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, so it's early in the rollout, but we're very pleased. It's been a very successful route, very successful customer experience trials, and not easy to do, by the way, in the middle of a pandemic. This is a complex instrument, and it has a world-class user interface and performs at a very high level from just an accuracy standpoint. You know, we've identified the hematology opportunity as very significant for the company. Keep in mind, a lot of our international markets are hematology first markets. So what that means is, if they have a choice in terms of, if it's one instrument, or none, they tend to choose hematology and they test with hematology, even before chemistry, even when they have both. So, in terms of the opportunity itself, as I earlier described it, you know, almost 100,000 placement, opportunities, two-thirds plus of which is internationally. But you know, even more importantly, if I pivot just a higher level comment, it's an important part of our overall in clinic solution. We tend to sell chemistry in hematology, increasingly SediVue together. So, having this type of solution, which from a performance and cost profile standpoint, you know, hits a sweet spot. The market is obviously very attractive to us. The other thing that I would point out is that increasingly, the IDEXX 360 program is just getting terrific traction internationally. And as part of that capital placement piece is the [indiscernible], and there\u2019s pull-through on reference labs and rapid essay in terms of delivering the underlying volume commitments. So, we're excited by the overall attack diagnostics opportunity that ProCyte One represents. It\u2019s going to have, you know, we think a very long tail both duration, as well as, you know, overall volume opportunity. So, more to come over time. Operator : And our last question is from Balaji Prasad from Barclays. Balaji Prasad : Thank you. Sorry, juggling different calls. Thanks for the question. So, just two-fold questions for me. One, pretty broad level one, trying to understand a defective growth, was there any element of growth coming through market share gains in this quarter or was it all what we could perceive broader industry growth, led by wizards and increasing utilization? And secondly, our Vet survey indicated at 200 basis points jump in [YoY] revenue contributions for clinics, from diagnostics, does that sound too as right and are aligned with your internal tracking? Thank you. Brian McKeon : So, you know, our markets are very competitive, they have always been very competitive. You know, we\u2019re pleased with what we've been able to advancing our commercial agenda. You know, we\u2019ve shared some data new and competitive placements with catalysts, both in North America, as well as international. So, you can, you know, make your own assumptions in terms of what that means. Our focus is just continuing to support and serve our customers with IDEXX Solutions. We do that both on a instrument side, obviously, the broader diagnostic solutions and software. And what we find is, when customers use all of our solutions, they grow faster, they tend to stay with us longer, and they find it supports their practice needs. In terms of the survey you're mentioning, I'm not familiar with that. So, I'm just going to withhold comment not knowing the underlying methodology. Balaji Prasad : Fair enough. Thank you. Maybe a specific comment, if you could throw some lights on what you're seeing with \u2013 since the launch of VETSCAN Imagyst in Q4, and if it is disrupting the market, and what you\u2019re seeing on the clinic side, in terms of comments? Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, you know, the thing to keep, I think you\u2019re asking a question more generally about the fecal detection. And, you know, our belief is that the fecal antigen test that we offer at the reference lab is best-in-class. It detects up to two times as much than traditional methods like [O&P], you know, there just a number of challenges in doing fecal within the clinic. You know, first and foremost is the sample prep, you know, piece, and that's very time consuming and continues to be, you know, messy, and then you can develop an algorithm that protects eggs, as you know, as part of the parasites or worms. But, you know, at the end of the day, they have to be available, that you have to be able to visually see them. The benefit in being able to detect through antigen testing is, you are able to see them in a prepaying period, which is between four and six weeks earlier than physically when the eggs are available. So, you get better detection [basis]. So, we like our solutions, we pick our customers, appreciate fecal antigen at the reference labs, and that's where we continue to support them. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Jay for final remarks. Jay Mazelsky : Thank you, I want to thank everybody for calling in. I want to express my gratitude to the IDEXX team for their ongoing, extraordinary performance during these challenging times. We have an amazing purpose and opportunity as a company and I couldn't be more appreciative of the IDEXX team, and how they live our mission every day. And so with that, we'll conclude the call, and thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our Web site. In reviewing our second quarter 2021 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth, and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2020, unless otherwise noted. [Operator Instructions]. To allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit their questions to one, with one follow-up as necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we will take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our second quarter results and to provide an update on our full year financial outlook for 2021. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered another quarter of outstanding financial results supported by continued strong global momentum in our companion animal business.  Revenue increased 30% as reported and 25% organically supported by 26% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting continued high gains across U.S. and international regions. As we work through comparisons to prior year COVID impacts, we'll be highlighting select two-year average annual revenue growth metrics to calibrate our business trends.  In the second quarter, average annual two-year organic growth for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues was 16%, in line with the strong two-year growth trends in Q4 and Q1. Operating profit increased 30% on a comparable basis in the second quarter, reflecting benefits from high revenue growth and moderate operating margin gains, as we begin to lap the tight cost controls introduced during the initial stages of the pandemic in 2020.  High operating profit gains enabled delivery of $2.34 in earnings per share, an increase of 33% on a comparable basis. Continued strong momentum in our CAG business has us on track to deliver high revenue and profit gains in 2021.  We're raising our full year revenue growth outlook range by $55 million at midpoint to 3,170 million to 3,205 million. This reflects an outlook for reported revenue growth of 17% to 18.5%, including favorable impacts from FX changes and benefits from our recent acquisitions. Our updated full year outlook is for 14.5% to 16% overall organic revenue growth and 16% to 17.5% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. These organic growth ranges are 1% to 1.5% higher than our last outlook, reflecting expectations for sustained strong performance in our CAG business globally.  Our full year financial outlook reflects a targeted 175 to 225 basis point improvement in operating margins on a comparable basis, up 25 basis points from our last outlook as we advance increase investments in our CAG innovation and commercial capability.  We're increasing our EPS outlook to $8.20 to $8.36 per share, up $0.25 per share at midpoint reflecting 25% to 27% full year comparable EPS growth. We'll discuss our updated 2021 financial outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our second quarter results and recent sector trends. Second quarter organic revenue growth of 25% was driven by 27% CAG revenue gains and 27% growth in our water business, benefitted from the lapping of prior year pandemic impacts. As noted, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 26% organically reflecting 24% growth in the U.S. and 30% growth in international regions. On a two-year basis, average annual CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 16% overall, reflecting 16% gains in the U.S. and 18% growth in international. Strong CAG results were also supported by 78% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues compared to constrained prior year levels. Q2 growth in U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues was aided by high year-on-year gains in U.S. clinical visits, benefiting in part from comparisons to lower visit levels in April and May of 2020. U.S. clinical visit growth was 13% overall in Q2 with strong gains across non-wellness and wellness visit categories. On an average two-year basis, same-store clinical visit growth increased at a 4.8% annual rate, down modestly from strong Q1 results.  The IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits was approximately 1,100 basis points in the second quarter, up moderately and on track with our full year outlook.  Expanding pet healthcare services, including continued solid increases in the utilization of diagnostics, supported a 16% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q2. Diagnostic revenue per practice increased 15% on a one-year basis and 12% on an average two-year basis in Q2.  Looking ahead to the second half of 2021, as noted in our last call, we expect to see lower levels of one-year growth in U.S. clinical visits and CAG Diagnostic revenue gains, as we lap the significant step up in demand we saw in the second half of 2020. These dynamics are factored into our revenue guidance which projects sustained strong tier growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues in H2.  IDEXX innovation and commercial initiatives continue to build on positive healthcare demand trends driving high Q2 organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities globally. IDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 25% organically in Q2, reflecting 20% plus organic gains in the U.S. and approximately 30% growth in international regions.  Our international reference lab gains continue to benefit from strong growth in Europe, supported by our new German core lab capability, our expanded commercial presence and growth in IDEXX 360 program agreements. Global reference lab gains continue to be driven by high same-store volume growth, with strong gains across testing categories.  IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 26% on an organic basis in the second quarter, also reflecting continued 20% plus growth in the U.S. and approximately 30% organic gains in international. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels, and expansion of our global premium instrument install base. CAG instrument placements increased significantly in Q2 compared to constrained prior year levels. Total premium placements reached 3,756 units, up over 400 units from strong Q1 results and doubled the placement levels seen last year.  The quality of CAG instrument placements remains excellent, reflected in 308 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 87% year-on-year and 938 new and competitive placements in international regions, up 75%.  We also benefited from 571 second catalyst placements, driven by continued strong demand from high volume customers. These new placements and high customer retention levels supported a 14% year-on-year growth in our global catalyst install base.  We achieved 1,119 premium hematology placements, including hundreds of ProCyte One installs as we advance our global rollout schedule. This supported 11% growth in our global premium hematology install base compared to Q2 2020.  We also placed 662 SediVue, including strong placement levels in international regions under IDEXX 360 agreements, which supported a year-on-year global increase in our premium urine sediment install base by 24%. We're looking forward to building on this momentum as we gain increased direct access at veterinary clinics globally and support strong demand for diagnostic testing.  Rapid assay revenues also expanded at a strong 28% organic growth rate in Q2, reflecting 20% plus gains in the U.S., supported by high demand for wellness testing and accelerated 30% plus growth in international geographies. Of note, core vector borne disease retention rates for U.S. rapid assay reached 97% in the quarter, aligned with sustained high IDEXX retention rates across our major modalities.  High CAG Diagnostic revenue growth remains primarily volume driven across our modalities with consistent overall net price gains of 2% to 3%. In other areas of our CAG business, our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 26% organically and 33% as reported, including initial benefits from our recent ezyVet acquisition.  We saw high growth in diagnostic imaging system placements, driven by favorable customer response to our entry level ImageVue DR30 platform with approximately 80% of placements at competitive accounts. We also continue to see 20% plus growth in recurring digital service revenues, including expansion of Web PACS subscriptions aligned with our expanding cloud-based capability. In our veterinary software services business, we posted double digit organic revenue gains driven by growth in Cornerstone and Neo placements, and strong growth in recurring services. As Jay will discuss, we expanded our cloud-based software capability to our recently announced acquisition of ezyVet, which closed in June. We estimate ezyVet will contribute approximately 15 million to full year 2021 revenues, which is factored into our updated outlook.  Turning to our other business segments, water business revenues increased 27% organically in Q2 compared to 16% declines in last year\u2019s second quarter driven by early pandemic-related impacts. We continue to see a solid recovery in demand for water testing as economies reopen including recovery in non-compliance related testing volumes that have been more constrained during the pandemic. Livestock poultry and dairy revenue decreased 2% organically in Q2. Those results were constrained by the lapping of high prior year demand in key areas such as African swine fever testing. Revenue growth was also impacted by relatively lower herd health screening levels reflecting reduced exports, including effects from restrictions on live animal imports into China.  We're planning on reduced LPE revenues year-on-year in the second half of 2021, as we continue to lap the benefits from high prior year demand for our ASF programs, and manage through expected pressure on our China LPD business from rebuilding swine herds, low pork prices, and changing government requirements related to livestock infectious disease programs. Turning to the P&L, we had another quarter of strong profit gains in Q2, driven primarily by benefits from high year-on-year CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains. We're now starting to work through comparisons to control costs levels in the prior year that were implemented as part of our pandemic contingency management efforts. Despite these dynamics, our strong revenue growth supported the solid 110 basis point expansion of our operating margins on a comparable basis, helping to drive an increase in operating profits of 34% as reported and 30% on a comparable basis.  Gross profit increased 29% in Q2, driven by high revenue gains. Gross margins decreased modestly on a comparable basis, reflecting mixed impacts from higher instrument revenue and moderated lab gross margins gains as we lapped tightly controlled prior year cost levels in key areas such as lab operations. Gross margin gains continue to benefit from strong CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth, including positive impacts for moderate price gains. We're planning for constrained gross margin gains over the balance of this year as we continue to lap tightly controlled prior year spending levels and see impacts from increases in reference lab staffing and capacity, aligned was supporting high revenue growth.  Operating expenses in Q2 increased 24% as reported and 20% on a comparable basis. In Q2 of 2020, we advanced approximately 25 million of cost reductions related to planned levels, including temporary reductions in salary and benefits, and also saw significant cost reductions in other areas such as employee healthcare accruals.  The higher operating expense cost growth in Q2 reflects lapping these dynamics as well as the advancement of investments in our global commercial and innovation capability, aligned with our accelerated revenue growth profile. We anticipate operating expense growth will be higher than revenue growth in the second half of 2021, as these investments and the integration of the ezyVet acquisition advance. We also expect to see relative increases in costs such as employee healthcare claims and travel, as pandemic-related restrictions are eased. Q2 EPS was $2.34 per share, including benefits of 6 million or $0.07 per share related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable basis, Q2 EPS increased 33%. Foreign exchange added 8 million to operating profits and $0.07 to EPS in Q2 net of 3 million in hedge losses.  Free cash flow was 211 million in the quarter and 316 million for the first half of 2021. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 95%, including benefits from delayed capital spending and extension of tax payments last year. We're increasing our outlook for full year 2021 capital spending to 150 million to 160 million to reflect additional investments to support manufacturing and distribution growth capacity, including approximately $20 million in real estate purchases. With this higher level of projected spending, we're updating our free cash flow conversion outlook for the full year to approximately 80% of net income.  Our balance sheet remains in a very strong position. We ended the quarter with debt to EBITDA leverage ratios of 0.9x gross and 0.7x net of cash with 232 million in cash and no borrowings on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We allocated 188 million in capital to repurchase 341,000 shares in the quarter.  Turning to our 2021 full year outlook, we're increasing our projected revenue range for overall revenue to 3,170 million to 3,205 million. At midpoint, this reflects approximately 30 million in organic operational improvement, approximately 10 million benefits from updated FX assumptions and approximately 15 million in increased full year revenue benefit from acquisitions. Our updated revenue outlook is 17% to 18.5% as reported, including approximately 2% for full year growth benefit from FX at approximately 0.5% benefit from acquisitions. Our updated overall organic revenue growth outlook of 14.5% to 16% reflects an estimated organic growth range of 16% to 17.5% for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue. The high end of our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook range reflects two-year average annual growth rates in line with strong H1 performance levels.  As noted on a one-year growth basis, we expect to see moderation in H2 from very high year-on-year growth rate seen in the first half of this year as you work through the comparison to the acceleration in growth that we saw in the second half of 2020, including fulfillment of pent-up demand in last year's third quarter. Other elements of our revenue growth outlook include expectations for lower year-on-year LPD revenues in the second half, and for a reduction in human COVID testing revenues year-on-year as we lapped the benefits over prior initiatives and plan for lower human PCR testing levels.  In terms of key financial metrics, we're increasing our reported operating margin outlook for 2021 to 28.6% to 29.1%, reflecting increased expectations for 175 to 225 basis points of full year comparable operating margin improvement.  Our EPS outlook incorporates updated projections for foreign exchange, which we now estimate will provide $0.17 of positive full year EPS benefit net of establish hedge positions. Our full year outlook also includes an updated estimate of $0.25 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity, $0.06 per share higher than our prior projections. We provided details on our updated estimates in the tables in our press release in earnings snapshot.  That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Jay Mazelsky : Thanks, Brian, and good morning. Today, we're pleased to report another quarter of strong results supported by continued favorable trends in our core CAG business and excellent execution by the IDEXX team. As noted, we delivered 25% organic revenue growth in the second quarter, supported by high organic CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth.  There were strong gains across all CAG business segments and testing modalities, representing a continuation of the accelerated growth trends we've seen since the second half of 2020. Strong sector growth and outstanding execution by the IDEXX team gives us confidence to raise our 2021 financial outlook, as we continue to invest towards our significant long-term growth opportunity.  Today, I'll provide a brief update on the trends we're seeing in key regions in our companion animal sector and discuss the status of our initiatives to strengthen our international commercial capabilities. I\u2019ll also share an update on our ProCyte One launch and growing software portfolio, including the ezyVet acquisition which will better position us to capitalize on favorable tailwinds, further enhance practice productivity and raise the standard of patient care.  Let me start with an update on sector trends. Global sector trends remained favorable in the second quarter reflected, for example, in sustained high U.S. clinical visit levels that support continued strong increases in veterinary service revenues, including diagnostics. As Brian noted, U.S. clinical visits increased 13% in the quarter and 4.8% on a two-year average annual basis, with continued strong gains across wellness and non-wellness categories. This growth was supported by growing pet population and veterinarians focus on medical services, which has sustained even as pandemic restrictions have eased. The solid trends we're seeing across all global regions in Q2, our strong commercial execution is building on this momentum, reflected in IDEXX CAG Diagnostics organic recurring revenue growth of 26% on a one-year basis and 16% on a two-year average annual basis.  Within the clinic, veterinarians and the teams continued to rise to the challenge of increased demand, working hard to keep up with industry growth, while also delivering excellent patient care to ever more engaged pet parents. IDEXX is well positioned to provide them the tools and services necessary to meet these demands, supporting 15% diagnostics revenue growth per practice, and even faster growth for IDEXX revenues. Overall, we feel very positive about the strong sector backdrop, our strategy to bring testing and information management innovation to the practice and our team's level of execution, which is reflected in our raised full year revenue outlook.  In terms of execution, our commercial team continues to deliver exceptional results despite continued constraint clinic access. Instrument placements showed increased momentum in the second quarter, with over 3,750 total premium placements, up solidly from a strong Q1, helping to drive 14% growth in our premium worldwide install base for the quarter.  This included double digit growth in premium chemistry, hematology and urine analysis and cell basis, as well as continued excellent growth in new and competitive accounts. Veterinary customers are extremely busy due to high visit volumes, and they're investing in IDEXX instruments, diagnostics and tools to support practice growth, patient care and staff productivity. Our digital cytology solution is an excellent example of this point and innovative service that extends the capability and reach of the practice. By providing cytology testing results in the U.S. with a report authored by expert pathologists in under two hours at any time during the day or week, 365 days a year, veterinarians are able to provide a higher standard of care to their patients, improve staff and clinical productivity, and drive appropriate testing and practice revenues. Validating this medical value proposition, we saw strong customer interest in orders for a digital cytology solution Q2. We also continue to advance key programs, like IDEXX preventive care that helped clinics raise the standard of care aligned with higher levels of pet owner engagement. In Q2, we executed 150 new preventive care enrollments as we continue to advance towards our goal of 10,000 engaged customers in the U.S. by 2024. In terms of customer access, we continue to operate in a hybrid model, with access to a limited but improving in both the U.S. and international regions. In the U.S., approximately 60% of customer visits were in-person in q2, whereas it was approximately 50% in Europe. This hasn\u2019t impacted our ability to deliver outstanding results as both new innovations and our excellent relationships we have with customers have driven significant growth across all regions.  The deep customer relationships with our sales professionals have only been reinforced and strengthened by the best-in-class support we provided to customers throughout the pandemic. Of note, we're particularly pleased with our high levels of execution in regions like Europe, where we are expanding the successful go-to-market approaches we've applied in the U.S.  This was reflected in 400 catalysts placements in new and competitive accounts outside of North America, with half of these placements under IDEXX 360 agreements. The expansion to the IDEXX 360 program is also supporting sustained strong gains and lab revenues in Europe, accelerating new account acquisition and helping to inspire faster customer growth at IDEXX 360 customers. A key focus of our strategy in this context is on developing the long-term international revenue opportunity through an expansion of our direct commercial presence. We've completed the commercial expansions first announced in Q3 of last year, which were focused on three countries; Germany, France and South Korea.  By almost doubling our commercial footprint in these countries, we have appreciably increased the frequency and intensity of our calling activities with existing customers and competitive accounts. Our experience is that when we do this, our customers grow faster as they adopt our innovations, and so do we.  Three additional countries have been targeted as the next stage for expansion over the remainder of 2021 and into 2022. We're excited to share with you our broader commercial approach at the upcoming Investor Day.  Our expanding global commercial capability will support the adoption of key innovations, like ProCyte One. Following our first U.S. shipments in late March, ProCyte One\u2019s international launch began in June with inflations and presale customers in France, Germany, UK, and in Southern Europe.  Many of our international geographies are hematology-focused, meaning customers prioritize CBC for patient health assessment. Not surprisingly, we've seen an extremely positive reaction to the ProCyte One introduction in international regions. Customers applauded simplicity and small footprint, while still delivering the excellent accuracy, usability and reliability profile veterinarians and their staff pride so highly. Additionally, we expect a multiplier impact from ProCyte One as chemistry and hematology testing go hand in hand with the additional potential to inspire reference lab and rapid assay business and placed as part of the IDEXX 360 program.  Speaking of rapid assay, we're very pleased with the strong momentum we continue to drive in this business globally. We achieved 20% plus organic growth in the U.S. in q2, while raising customer retention levels to 97% supported by innovations like SNAP Pro. We now have over 80% of SNAP 4Dx customer volume engaged on this platform, which enhances insight and supports practice workflow.  SNAP Pro is also helping to achieve accelerated growth in international regions. In Europe, after installing a clinic\u2019s first SNAP Pro, we see a significant expansion in testing volumes. We look forward to building on the strong momentum supported by continued IDEXX innovation. We're also excited with the progress we're advancing on our cloud-based software capability. We had another excellent quarter of new software installations with Cornerstone and Neo placements growing 21%, while cloud-based offerings continue to represent the majority of PIMS placement. As we continue to expand our install base, we also continue to drive expansion to profitable recurring services, such as credit card processing, which grew at strong double digit rates organically. Software solutions have taken on significant importance to the effective management of the veterinary practice.  Practices have never been busier and IDEXX integrated easy-to-use software solutions to support patient care and workflow, productivity and communications amongst the care team and with the client. Moreover, IDEXX diagnostic solutions are seamlessly integrated into both our and third party solutions, enabling practices to capture and invoice the full range of activities that veterinarian deliver.  We know that IDEXX customers who use all of our solutions have a higher customer experience and tend to test more and grow faster. Relating to the growing importance of practice software solutions, cloud-based technologies have the potential to make important contributions to the overall software experience of the veterinary clinic.  For example, practice owners are free from the challenges of supporting on-premise IP solutions that include frequent hardware updates. Moreover, providers of cloud-based solutions like IDEXX to provide frequent, seamless updates in an environment that offers security advantages. Our software capabilities were augmented in Q2 with the acquisition of ezyVet, a fast growing innovative practice information management system that is native cloud-based, used by advanced general practices as well as specialty, emergency and large corporate groups worldwide.  This acquisition complements our PIMS portfolio by providing additional options to practices with more complex needs and enterprise functionality. Customers appreciate ezyVet software for its easy use and rich features. In fact, ezyVet is the number one rated full featured practice management solution with 94% customer satisfaction according to Capterra, an industry standard business software customer review site.  Bringing ezyVet into the IDEXX family also grows our cloud development talent, enabling us to capitalize on the evolving nature of the veterinary clinic software product. With that, I'd like to welcome the ezyVet team to IDEXX. We look forward to working together with you to continue to develop best-in-class software products.  We're also excited about the progress we're driving in our diagnostic imaging business. We saw very strong growth in digital imaging placements in Q2 and strong growth in our backlog, reflecting a continued appreciation of our focus on providing a full range of premier low-dose imaging solutions.  Growth of these placements also supports the expansion of recurring services, including cloud-based services like Web PACS. Our Web PACS subscriptions grew at high-teens rates with much faster growth in premium and unlimited subscription tiers, reflecting the high value and diagnostic insight clinicians derived from IDEXX software solutions. Overall, we're very pleased with our business momentum and optimistic as we continue to respond to the reopening of economies globally.  In terms of IDEXX\u2019s specific plans, we're excited to advance plans to bring more IDEXXs back to the office safely and in ways that ensure business continuity. We anticipate maintaining a more hybrid working environment and appreciate our employees\u2019 flexibility in adapting to new ways of working while continuing to deliver high growth, provide top notch customer service and support our world- class product portfolio.  Before I wrap up my remarks, I\u2019d like to publicly welcome a new leader to IDEXX. Dr. Martin Smith will be joining my leadership team in August as Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. Martin brings 30-plus years of experience in the life sciences industry, most recently as Chief Technology Officer at Cytiva and Pall Corporation, both subsidiaries of Danaher.  He has a strong track record of driving R&D strategy in concert with enterprise strategic initiatives, commercial efforts, and we look forward to Martin leading our world-class R&D organization. Welcome, Martin. With that, I'd like to add that I'm extremely proud of the way the entire IDEXX team is executing as we are on track for another strong year in 2021 with financial performance aligned with our long-term goals. Our growth and performance reflect a consistent business strategy focused on opportunity development within our core businesses, and our employees continue to execute against this strategy daily.  I look forward to sharing more on our strategy and long-term potential at our upcoming Investor Day on Thursday, August 12. The event remains virtual due to the evolving nature of COVID-19, and we invite you to register on the Investor Relations section of our Web site.  Participating will be members of my senior management team, including Brian McKeon, Executive Vice President and CFO; Dr. Tina Hunt, Executive Vice President and General Manager for Point of Care Diagnostics and Worldwide Operations; Mike Lane, Executive Vice President and GM for Reference Laboratories and Information Management; Jim Polewaczyk, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Kerry Bennett, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Advanced Analytics; and Michael Schreck, Senior Vice President of Veterinary Software and Services. The event will last approximately three hours. It will conclude with a Q&A session.  That concludes my opening remarks. We now have time for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Michael Ryskin from Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. I guess first question would be on sort of the updated guide and the outlook for the second half of the year. And mostly I want to focus on the P&L. I just want to make sure we have all the moving pieces. It seems like you're expecting some incremental spend, some T&E coming back, some healthcare costs going higher. Could you walk us through the cadence of that and how we expect that to come back? And is that really just tied to sort of going back to prior ways of doing business pre-COVID? Is that some incremental spin on top of that? So what are the investment areas? How that should roll in, in the second half? And sort of what's the plan there going forward as far as an effect [indiscernibe]? Brian McKeon : Sure. Thanks, Mike, for your question. On OpEx, we're transitioning into a period now where we're comparing to more control cost levels from the prior year. I think you saw that in the second quarter where the comparable OpEx was up 20%. And we are starting to see some costs come back, things like healthcare accruals were up in the second quarter, we expect that to continue. And as the pandemic conditions hopefully continue to get eased, we expect to see some T&E come back. As well, we're advancing investments. We've talked about the commercial investments, particularly in areas like international and our R&D organization. We're leaning into the positive growth. And overall, we think that will create an environment where we've got sustained higher OpEx growth year-on-year and it will be above the revenue growth, which is now up against tougher compares. So that's really the dynamic that we're working through. I think it's all very healthy. We think we're on track for very good full year performance in terms of margin improvement, and look forward to building off that going forward. But second half, we'll be working through those dynamics. Michael Ryskin : And are you seeing any incremental issues of freight costs, transportation cost, any other inflation factors, whether it's sort of on the raw material side or on the human capital side in the market? Brian McKeon : Selectively, I wouldn't say it's been a big impact on our business. I think more just managing through keeping up with the high demand has been the bigger challenge for the business. And I think we've been able to manage those dynamics well. So it hasn't been as big a factor for us to date. Michael Ryskin : Okay. And as far as some of the new products you called out, things like ProCyte, can you give us an update on sort of how vets are interacting with the sales force and how some of the nuances are going on? I realize it's been a very different environment launching something during COVID than traditionally. I'm just wondering if you could speak to willingness to uptake and sort of expand the menu offering versus sort of relying on the traditional tools. Jay Mazelsky : Good morning, Mike. Yes, as we indicated in the remarks, the practices are incredibly busy at this point, maybe never busier. And so they certainly welcome I think new menu, new tools, ProCyte One specifically, that helps with productivity. So the reception has been outstanding. We see in the case of the U.S., about 60% of our visits are now in person. Internationally, it's about 50% or so. So they really welcome the opportunity to reengage what they consider to be trusted advisors and partners in the field. And more and more they're looking to IDEXX to be able to provide the analyzers and software solutions that really help them from the standpoint of not just increasing patient care, which has always been the case, but also really driving staff productivity and communications within the practice and with their clients. So overall very, very positive. And we think that there's really an exceptional long-term opportunity, not just in hematology with the ProCyte One, but the entire in clinic that lab suite, because as you know, hematology and chemistry are also very often in vast majority of cases used together. Michael Ryskin : Thanks. I will get back in the queue. Operator : And our next question is from Erin Wright from Credit Suisse. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. I'm curious what you're seeing or assuming in your guidance in terms of the sustainability of growth in clinical visits and just overall veterinary demand trends, what are you seeing on a monthly basis and also quarter-to-date? I'm just curious if the recurring CAG momentum here is holding up on a two-year stack basis, and if there's any sort of seasonal dynamics as well to consider here? Thanks. Brian McKeon : Yes, why don't I start and I think Jay can help with color on what we're seeing at the clinic level. The trends in the sector and in our growth held up very well in the second quarter. The CAG Dx recurring, as you note, on a two-year stack basis, that's the way we like to track it as we're working through some of these compares was a little above 16% is pretty much in line with what we saw in Q1 and Q4. And so that's very encouraging. I think we're benefiting from continued solid market trends at the clinic level. The visit number was down a bit Q4 to Q1, but the diagnostic revenue growth on a one-year and a two-year stack basis sustained at very good rates. So all indications are demand is holding up very well and that's informing our full year outlook, the higher end of our outlook ranges for the two-year trends to continue in the second half for CAD Dx recurring. And we obviously have a range because there may be some other dynamics that we don't anticipate that go on, and we're going to learn more as we're working through. Hopefully the economies continue to open, but I think we're very encouraged by the strong trends. Jay Mazelsky : Just to build on that. Definitely the demand trends remain intact. And I think the execution and our ability to be able to build on that has also been very strong. We saw, as Brian indicated, 60% global two-year CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue. And if you break it down by region, it was 15.5% in the U.S. and international and really across all modalities. So the in-clinic, rapid essay and the reference lab business. I think the really positive thing on top of that was just the instrument placement, really strong growth coming off of a strong Q1 and the compare to a depressed level last year. Practices report, as I had indicated earlier, being extremely busy. It's not surprising given a lot of the factors we've talked about in the past, and they're looking more and more to be able to really partner with IDEXX and helping them increase the productivity of care workflow as well as the business itself. Erin Wright : Okay, great. And then just given some of the stepped up investments internationally, are you seeing any changes in the competitive landscape there? And this goes back also to my bigger question, I guess, that people have is what's the right size for the commercial effort overall? It sounds like you're seeing the growth to justify it. But how are you thinking about in terms of your optimal goal there? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Sure. So we'll talk a bit about that at Investor Day in terms of how we're thinking about the international market and sort of what the end state is, and what the footprint should look like. What I will say is that our international investments, we're doing this on a rolling basis. As I indicated, three countries are behind us and three countries are now on the dock. And lots of -- I think the markets internationally are very robust. Veterinary practices are also busy. And we know that, from the standpoint of best or most optimized loading, we're still far off from where we are in the U.S. just by way of benchmark. We have about 120 accounts or so for per account manager. Internationally, it's a lot less. So we think that the investments internationally offer really good return. There's a lot of -- I think there's a lot of market development still before us. And again, we'll provide a little more specific meat on a bone when we meet in a couple of weeks. Erin Wright : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Jon Block from Stifel. Jon Block : Thanks, guys. Good morning. First question is centered on capacity. In the snapshot in the wellness clinical growth decelerated in a two-year stack basis to roughly 85%. It had been 12% to 13% stacked, again, the wellness the prior three quarters. And I feel sometimes Wall Street takes for granted by sort of the ability of an industry to absorb all the additional demand. We've actually anecdotally heard of some practices turning away new customers. So as market leaders, I\u2019d love to get your thoughts, what are you guys hearing? Are there any capacity constraints going on in the industry that's pushing off wellness tests? And this might be a slight headwind for the industry, as we think about the next handful of quarters. Jay Mazelsky : Yes, Jon, I'll take that. The veterinarians will tell you that they're extremely busy, and that's a good thing. So they at times may find themselves fatigued or not being able to take on new clients, and that's to be expected. Having said that, I think they're very creative at being able to increase the capacity within the practice, if you're doing things like adding staff and that sometimes takes time, increasing the number of exam rooms. I think they're investing in software and diagnostics and other tools that help them be more productive. So there's lots of things that they can do short term as well as intermediate term to be able to increase capacity, extending hours, using reference lab services, which takes some of the pressure off veterinary technicians. So, I think it's largely a good thing. And we're seeing some of the markets work in terms of dynamically being able to react to the increased demand. Jon Block : Okay. And maybe just part B to that one, a follow up. Are you seeing that translate from the veterinarians\u2019 perspective on raising prices to the pet parent? In other words, the demand\u2019s there. They're actually pushing through price. And does that give you guys an opportunity when we think about 2% to 3% annual price increases to maybe bump that up? And then I'll just ask my second question, if that's okay. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. So I mean that's situational. We don't have end market visibility in terms of how they're pricing to their clients. We obviously sell them diagnostic solutions that they markup on that insofar as they may be paying their staff more. I think what is true is their end markets are very robust, in that they do have room to increase prices without necessarily negatively impacting patient demand. But I think that's case by case. I think most practices are taking a long-term view and really they're very loyal, have very good relationships with pet owners, and they want to obviously maintain those. And where they have to raise prices I guess, bottom line is they do. But in most cases, what we're seeing is it is pretty moderate. Jon Block : Okay. And then my second question, Brian, for you. I think I've got these numbers right, but you raised EPS from 1Q to 2Q and midpoint by $0.25. I think stock comp, tax and FX was $0.12 on the button. And I'm guessing ezy might have been another nickel. But can you talk about the flow through on that remaining 30 million of core revenue increase? It just seems like the incremental is on that 30 million if I run through the math. Is it too dissimilar from corporate averages? Is that true? And maybe is that reflective of what you're alluding to of some of the reinvestments in the business in the back part of the year? Thanks. Brian McKeon : Yes, I think you're bridging math. We did have a couple cents from FX. I think stock comp was $0.06 from where we were. So that was about $0.08 of the $0.25. And the stock comp is the tax effect. I wouldn't know ezy. That is not something that we're -- in fact, that's a bit of a headwind for us as we integrate that acquisition. So the flow through is quite good. In terms of the increase on the full year, it's not fundamentally different than the outlook that we had before. I think we're very pleased to be able to raise the revenue number operationally and the EPS number operationally, and just building on the strong trends that we have in the business and that allows us to also continue to invest towards the future growth opportunities that we try to highlight. And I think we are very encouraged with the strong growth in our international business is reinforcing. That's a great place to invest and can really set us up to sustain the strong growth going forward. Jon Block : Perfect. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Brian, maybe going back to your comments on margins. There's obviously been a lot of variability last year and in the first part of this year, just given the different pandemic effects that you guys have felt. So I guess like when we think about operating margins for kind of 2022 and beyond, how should we kind of frame the right jumping off point, kind of assuming that these pandemic effects normalize? I guess what\u2019s sort of the right baseline type margin as we think about the business going forward? Brian McKeon : We'll share more on that at Investor Day. I think it will be a similar discussion to dialogues we've had in the past. We think that we can build off the improvements that we were able to drive and will continue to target sort of that 50 to 100 basis points of annual comparable improvement over time. The drivers there is the strong CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth, enables us to do things like continue to improve our lab productivity and that's a positive driver for us. Still we think we've got ongoing runway to improve our gross margins. And it enables us to reinvest towards expanding the annuity in our business over the long term, which has been very high return on investment for us. And we try to calibrate that appropriately based on how we can execute and ensuring that we're delivering good financial performance annually. But we look forward to building on this progress. I think we're going to have some -- as we noted, some specific dynamics we\u2019re working through here more just related to compares to the pandemics and some of the cost controls we had in place. But that's a near-term dynamic that we're confident we can manage. Nathan Rich : Great. And then just a couple of quick follow ups. Brian, I think if I caught the number right, you said that in the second quarter, you were lapping I think $25 million of cost reductions. Did I catch that right? And do you have a comparable number for 3Q and 4Q as we think about cycling the temporary cost reductions from last year? Brian McKeon : We implemented at the height of the kind of early phase of the pandemic spread, salary and benefit freezes and a number of other actions, and that was a $25 million reduction to our plan levels. And so it gets a little noisy. As we work through the year, we started reinstating aspects of that. But we basically kept headcount controls in place and benefited from pretty significant year-on-year reductions in things like T&E and in healthcare costs. So, we'll continue to see dynamics from that. I think it was meaningful in Q2 relatively more than the balance of the year, but still something that will play out over the next couple of quarters. And we'll try to help you understand that dynamic as we report our results. Nathan Rich : Great. And if I could just sneak one more in. You've continued to see the premium or the spread between clinical visits and the CAG Dx growth above that 9% to 10% range that I think had been assumed in guidance at the beginning of the year. Is that still roughly the right range to use for the full year overall? Or just given what you\u2019ve seen develop in the first half, do you think that you could continue to see that slightly higher spread than what you've seen historically? Brian McKeon : That's a good question. I think we're very pleased with that. It was about 1,100 basis points in Q2 and it was 900 in Q1. Normalized, it was about 1,000 to 1,100. And if I recall, we had some days effects in there. So we feel quite good about that. I think we've factored that thinking into our guidance range. And as we noted earlier, the high end is really sustaining those kind of trends, the strong two-year growth trends for the back half. So that's clearly a factor that helps to drive our confidence in that number. Jay Mazelsky : Yes, Nate, the way we tend to think about that is it's also I think directly related to our execution, which has been excellent, both from an innovation standpoint and we have lots of new stuff, like ProCyte One and digital cytology and software solutions like ezyVet, and also our commercial expansion. So the market\u2019s doing one thing, and it's a very strong market backdrop. And then our execution and ability to develop these markets is the other factor. And I think we've demonstrated a very strong execution in being able to do that. So we're optimistic. Nathan Rich : Great. I really appreciate the comments. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Ekaterina [ph] on for Chris. Thank you so much for taking our questions. So the first question is on innovation. And we've obviously seen through very healthy pet ownership and standard of care trends over these past several quarters. Is this making you think any differently about R&D and the type of tests that you're developing, something that perhaps didn't make economic sense for the vet or pet owner previously but makes sense just given the higher willingness to pay? And then the second question is, outside of the U.S., talk a bit about the regional differences you're seeing in both visits and testing utilization as countries are exiting the pandemic? Are there countries where you're seeing better or worst trends? And how do you see that evolving through the year? Thank you. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. So I'll talk about the innovation piece first. Our investment appetite for innovation has always been very high. We think that innovation at the end of the day produces differentiation and solves really challenging customer problems, both clinically and from a business standpoint. So if you look at 2020 last year, we came out with seven I think significant product and service introductions. And they were all extremely well received by our customers and adopted. So we continue to invest in innovation. We'll talk at Investor Day about our approach and the framework in terms of how we think about it, but it involves platforms and instruments and assays and obviously, software as we've talked about, but also innovation in terms of just business models and our reference lab network. So that's alive and well and continues to be a real focus area for us. In terms of your questions around regional differences and testing utilization, as indicated, we've seen really strong growth across the board. The U.S. and North America has much higher use of diagnostics, and that's something that we think over time we can drive increased market adoption internationally with -- the TAM is about 2x from a potential opportunity standpoint relative to the U.S., and that's a function of more than just commercial expansion. It's a function of really putting in place reference lab network like we've done in Kornwestheim, the centers of excellence and broader set of solutions that customers value so much. You do see some, and I would say modest differences just by country in terms of how they're reacting to the pandemic. So we've seen a little bit lower in-person visits in Europe relative to the U.S. U.S. is about 60%. Europe, for example, was 50%. But our ability to continue to support our customers and customers transacting business hasn't really changed as a result of that. I think they've adopted well to the changing environment, and they're seeing a lot of traffic just like we're seeing in the U.S. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Ryan Daniels from William Blair. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. Nick [indiscernible] in for Ryan. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the solid quarter again. Earlier in your comments, you mentioned that about 60% of your visits in the U.S. at least right now are in-person. I'm assuming you're talking about your sales visits? And then if so, how has that kind of been tracking over the last quarter? Has it been kind of steadily going up? Jay Mazelsky : Right. The 60% does refer to customer facing sales visits. That has gone up from what's plateau about 50% thereabouts at sort of the height of last year is a little bit below 50%. But we adapted very quickly to the changed environment. And obviously, it's a function of how things play out going forward, whether that continues to increase in terms of the Delta variant and some of the procedures local governments have put in place in addition to CDC. But we expect as the pandemic recedes that it will continue to increase our in-person visits, but to be determined. Unidentified Analyst : Is that a number that, say, like in a post-COVID era ever returns to 100%, or are you kind of realizing some of the benefits from kind of a virtual sales process such that you'll kind of keep that going on at least for a little bit going forward? Jay Mazelsky : Yes. I think there's been some great takeaways in terms of what visits really should be done in person versus where you can support the customer virtually. I think from the standpoint of getting those benefits from a productivity standpoint. I don't think we'd go back to 100%. Having said that, I think what our customers would like to say, given how busy they are is more efficient visits. So at one point, maybe they have time for 45 minutes or an hour, and now they'd like to be able to get them the same amount of work and conversation in 20 minutes or 25 minutes. So we think there's great opportunity there to help them and to increase productivity on both sides of the partnership. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. That's definitely helpful. And then I guess on the visit and practice revenue front, it looks like there is a little kind of variability in what would be revenue per visit quarter-over-quarter. I was wondering if there's any dynamics to kind of call out on that front. Brian McKeon : It held up well. I think there's always a bit of quarter-to-quarter variability. Nothing really specifically. We're trying to highlight our trends were quite good. I think vets are very busy. I think that's one thing that we hear gives us a way so that could be a dynamic. But overall, I think the bigger theme is continued strong growth, and we're feeling good about our outlook. Jay Mazelsky : Okay. I want to thank everybody for calling in. I also want to express my gratitude to the IDEXX team for their continued exceptional performance. We have an amazing purpose as a company and our employees represent our values every day. I couldn't be more appreciative of their efforts and what we accomplished this past quarter.  With that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] To allow broad participation in the Q&A we ask that each participants limit their questions to one with one follow-up as necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back in the queue and if time permits, we'll take your additional questions. I would now like to turn it over to Brian McKeon. Brian Mc Keon : Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to share another quarter of excellent financial results for IDEXX, driven by continued strong global momentum in our companion animal business. In terms of highlights, revenue increased 12% as reported and 10% organically compared to high prior-year growth levels. Third quarter results reflect 11.5% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues with double-digit gains across U.S. and international markets. 2-year average annual organic growth for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues sustained at 16%, reflecting mid-to-high teens, 2-year average gains across our major modalities. We also achieved a record third quarter level of premium instrument placements with strong global gains across our major platforms. High revenue growth and sustained operating margins compared to high prior-year levels, supported delivery of $2.03 in earnings per share, an increase of 12% on a comparable basis. Momentum in our CAG business has us on track to deliver 15.5% to 16% organic revenue growth, 200 to 225 basis points in comparable operating margin gains, and 26% to 27% comparable EPS growth in 2021 at the higher end of our previous guidance ranges. Walk through the details of our updated full-year outlook later in my comments, let's begin with a review of our third quarter results in recent sector trends. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 10% was driven by 13% CAG revenue gains and 13% growth in our water business. These gains were moderated by a 23% organic decline in LPD revenues compared to high prior-year levels, which benefited from the ramping of African swine fever testing in China, as well as by a $3 million a year-on-year decline in human COVID PCR testing. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 11.5% organically compared to strong prior year growth levels and working 10% gains in the U.S. and 14% growth in international regions. On a two-year basis, average annual CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 16% overall, reflecting 16% gains in both U.S. and international regions. Strong CAG results were also supported by 15% organic growth in veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging revenues in addition to benefits from our recent easy bet acquisition and 33% year-on-year growth in CAG Diagnostic instrument revenues. We continue to achieve very high levels of supply chain reliability across our business, reflecting outstanding performance by our operating teams, enabling us to support continued high levels of growth in customer service. Continued strong U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was supported by year-on-year gains and U.S. clinical visits. U.S. clinical visit growth was 2% overall in Q3 with solid gains across wellness and non-wellness categories. This compared to strong 7% gains in the third quarter of 2020, which included benefits from pent-up clinical demand, including very high growth in wellness testing. On a 2-year basis, U.S. same-store clinical visit growth increased at a 4.4% average annual rate, sustaining above annual clinic visit growth trends heading into the pandemic. The IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits was approximately 850 basis points on a 1-year basis compared to very strong prior year growth levels for diagnostic testing, which supported a 1500 basis point growth premium last year. On an average 2-year basis, which helps to calibrate for year-on-year pandemic dynamics, the growth premium was approximately 1200 basis points in the third quarter, slightly higher than the 2-year trends in the first half of the year. Expanding pet healthcare services, including continued solid increases in the utilization of diagnostics, supported a 7% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinical revenues in Q3. Diagnostic revenues per practice increased 7% on a 1-year basis and 13% on an average 2-year basis consistent with recent 2-year growth trends. IDEXX, innovation and commercial engagement continues to build on positive healthcare demand trends, driving high Q3 organic revenue gains across our major testing modalities globally. IDEXX reference lab revenues increased 10% organically in Q3 with similar year-on-year gains in U.S. and international regions. Global Reference Lab gains continue to be driven by high same-store volume growth for strong gains across testing categories. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 14% organically in the third quarter, reflecting double-digit gains in the U.S., and continued high growth in international regions. Gains continue to be supported by increases in testing utilization across regions, high customer retention levels, and expansion of our global premium instrument installed base. IDEXX achieved a third quarter record of 4,307 premium CAG instrument placements, up over 1,100 units, or 36% from constrained prior levels, reflecting strong gains across U.S. and international regions. We saw a strong global placement gains across our platforms with catalyst up 22%, premium hematology up 62%, and SediVue up 30%. The quality of CAG instrument placements remains excellent, reflected in 344 catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts in North America, up 14% year-on-year, and 1,003 new and competitive placements in international regions, up 17%. We also benefited from 571 second catalyst placements driven by continued strong demand from high-volume customers. The global rollout of ProCyte One continues to support strong overall placement momentum with the majority of our ProCyte One placements in new and competitive accounts. New instrument placements, and continued very high customer retention levels, supported a 14% year-on-year growth in our global premium installed base, setting a foundation for continued high-growth in IDEXX VetLab recurring diagnostic revenues. Rapid assay revenues expanded 9% organically in Q3 compared to strong prior-year demand levels that included benefits from pent-up demand for wellness testing. Growth in vector-borne disease testing drove solid year-on-year volume games in the U.S., and global growth continues to benefit from double-digit gains in international regions. High CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume-driven across our modalities with consistent overall net price gains of 2% to 3%. In other areas of our CAG business or veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 15% organically and 33% as reported, including benefits from our recent ezyVet acquisition. Strong growth in veterinary software services was supported by double-digit comparable gains in PIMS placements and continued strong growth in related recurring services. We also saw continued high-growth in diagnostic imaging system placements driven by our entry-level ImageVue DR30 platform, with nearly 80% of placements at competitive accounts. We continue to see 20% plus growth in recurring digital service revenues, including expansion of Web PACS subscriptions aligned with our expanding Cloud-based capability. Turning to other business segments, water revenue increased 13% organically in Q3 compared to 4% organic declines in last year's third quarter, as this business continues to track back towards pre - COVID, growth levels. Business growth was supported by solid gains across compliance and non-compliance testing categories. Livestock, Poultry, and Dairy revenue decreased organically 23% in Q3 compared to 18% organic growth levels in Q3 of 2020. Overall dynamics in our China LPD and related export testing businesses offset growth in other global regions. As expected, Q3 revenue growth was constrained by the lapping of high prior-year demand for African Swine Fever testing and lower herd health screening levels. We're now seeing additional constraints on China LPD testing demand reflecting relaxation of local African Swine sweep -- Swine Fever disease management approaches in China, and as we work through impacts from low pork prices and changing government regulations related to livestock infectious disease testing programs. Reflecting these factors, we're planning for continued lower LPD revenues overall on upcoming quarters, which is factored into our 2021 financial outlook. Turning to the P&L, sustained high revenue growth supported double-digit comparable operating profit and EPS gains. Operating profit increased 32% as reported, including benefits from the lapping of $27.5 million G&A charge, related to an ongoing litigation matter, which is excluded from our comparable growth metrics. On a comparable basis, operating profits expanded 12% and operating margins increased 20 basis points compared to high prior-year levels, which included benefits from pandemic-related cost controls. Gross profit increased 12% in Q3 reflecting strong revenue gains. Gross margins decreased modestly on a comparable basis as benefits from continued high recurring CAG Diagnostic revenue growth, and moderate net price gains were offset by business mix impacts from high CAG instrument revenue growth and lower LPD and human PCR revenues. We also saw some gross margin impact from investments in our lab businesses to support high growth and customer service levels. Operating expenses decreased 2% as reported, and increased 10% on a comparable basis in Q3. As expected, we saw a higher level of comparable OpEx growth as we advance investments in our global and commercial innovation capability and onboard the ezyVet acquisition. Q2 -- Q3 EPS was $2.03 per share, including benefits of $4 million or $0.05 per share related to share-based compensation activity. On a comparable basis, Q3 EPS increased 12%. Foreign exchange added $2 million to operating profits and $0.02 to EPS in Q3, net of $2 million in hedge losses. Free cash flow was $354 million in Q3 and $458 million for the first 9 months of 2021. On a trolling -- trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 88%. We increased our 2021 full-year outlook for free cash flow conversion to 80% to 85% of net income, reflecting a refined capital spending estimate of approximately $150 million, including approximately $20 million in real estate purchases. As we advance plans for 2022, we expect an increase in capital spending levels to support additions to our manufacturing distribution capacity aligned with our high-growth profile. Our Balance Sheet remains at a strong position. We ended the quarter with debt to EBITDA leverage ratios of 0.8 times gross and 0.7 times net of cash with $145 million in cash and no borrowings on our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We allocated $184 million in capital to repurchase 275,000 shares in the quarter. Turning to our 2021 full-year outlook we're updating our projected range for overall revenue to $3,185 million to $3,200 million. Based on our continued strong momentum in Q2 -- Q3, we're increasing the lower end of our organic growth outlook by 1%, and maintaining the higher end of our growth outlook aligned with sustained high 2-year annual growth trends for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Operationally, this results in an increase of $10 million in our full-year revenue outlook at midpoint. These improvements were offset by a $5 million FX headwind compared to our last outlook related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our updated reported revenue growth outlook is 17.5% to 18%, including approximately 1.5% of full-year growth benefit from the FX and 0.5% of growth benefit from acquisitions. Our updated overall organic growth outlook of 15.5% to 16% reflects an estimated organic growth range of 17% to 17.5% for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue. Other elements of our revenue growth outlook include continued expectations for lower year-on-year LPD revenues in the second half and for a reduction in human COVID testing revenues year-on-year. In terms of key financial metrics we've refined our reported operating margin outlook for 2021 to 28.8% to 29% reflecting expectations for 200 basis points to 225 basis points of full-year comparable operating margin improvement at the high end of our last guidance range. We're planning for moderately lower operating margins in Q4 compared to high prior-year levels, driven by mix impacts and advancement of commercial and innovation investments and target project spending, aligned with our high-growth profile. We're raising our EPS guidance range by $0.06 at midpoint, to $8.30 to $8.38, reflecting 26% to 27% full-year comparable EPS growth. We now estimate FX will provide $0.16 of positive full-year EPS benefits, $0.01 lower than our earlier estimates net of established heads positions. We've also refined our overall effective tax estimate to 19%, including an updated estimate of $0.29 per share of tax benefit related to share-based compensation activity. We provided details on our updated estimates in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. As we complete 2021, we're advancing our plans for 2022 aligned with sustaining our strong revenue growth. We're confident we can maintain our excellent supply chain performance to support continued high-growth and manage any inflationary impacts in our business while building on our strong 2021 profit results. We look forward to providing specifics on our 2022 financial outlook on our Q4 earnings call. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Jay Mazelsky : Thank you, Brian. Good morning. We're pleased to report another quarter of excellent results for IDEXX driven by sustained momentum in our CAG business, we delivered double-digit organic revenue growth overall, supported by 11.5% organic CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth, compared to very strong prior-year growth levels. 2-year average annual organic growth rates across testing modalities were in line with growth in the first half of 2021 with clinical visit trends sustaining above pre -pandemic levels. These strong trends are evidence that veterinary practices worldwide continue to focus on elevating standards of care by leveraging IDEXX as advanced product and service platforms. The IDEXX team is doing an outstanding job supporting continued high-growth of customer service levels, putting us on track towards 2021 financial performance at the high-end of our previous outlook and above our long-term goals. Today, I highlight key areas of progress in our product and commercial initiatives that position us to deliver continued high-growth and strong financial returns. Let's begin with a brief update on sector trends. Positive companion animal healthcare trends continued in the third quarter, building on the accelerated demand levels achieved throughout the pandemic. U.S. critical visit growth was 2% in Q3, compared to strong 7% prior year third quarter growth levels, which included benefits from pent-up demand. To normalized for prior-year pandemic dynamics, we are monitoring two-year average annual growth rates, which were 4.4% in Q3. Continuing above the pre -pandemic levels of 2% to 3%. Wellness clinical visit growth of 6% on a 2-year basis points to continued adoption of our preventive approach to pet healthcare. The sustained underlying momentum reflects the continued strengthening of the pet on our bond. The benefit of stepped up growth in the pet population beginning early during the COVID19 pandemic through early 2021, and sustained focus in the veterinary clinic on medical services. Around the world, veterinarians passion for their work combined with pet owners desire for excellent care, have driven this focus on services as they remain extremely busy. U.S. practice revenue growth in the third quarter advanced the healthy 7% versus the prior year, and an even more impressive 9% on a 2-year basis, supported by 2-year average growth of 11% in clinical revenue and 13% in diagnostic revenue. Customers are clearly attracted to IDEXX's broad portfolio of products and services to support the elevated levels of demand, while also growing their practices. These positive dynamics are also true in our international regions. IDEXX 's growth is sustaining at an even stronger rate reflected in the 16%, 2-year average annual growth in CAG Diagnostics' recurring revenues in Q3, a premium of nearly 1200 basis points above 2-year average critical visit growth rates. High levels of execution and consistently strong sector trends reinforce our confidence in sustaining strong growth momentum as we finish the year and build our plans for 2022. Outstanding commercial execution has been a key driver of our business performance and our team continues to support our customers at a high level. This is evidenced by 36% year-on-year growth in premium instrument placements in Q3, a record number of third quarter placements for the Company. High-growth across our Catalyst, ProCyte, and SediVue platform supported a 14% overall year-over-year increase in our premium installed base. Veterinarians are using IDEXX 's diagnostic tools to build capacity and improve efficiency within the clinic to support future growth, which is also reflected in high levels of second Catalyst placements and continued strong 16% gains in Catalyst placements, had new and competitive accounts. Our strong global instrument place mode momentum has long-term benefits and gives us further confidence that future consumable streams will also support continued strong growth. These results were achieved despite continued constraints on direct access to customers. Time for our customers is a scarce and valuable resorts. In-person sales trends remain at approximately 60% in the U.S. and slightly lower in Europe at over 50%. Despite these constraints, our teams are into high levels of connection to our customers to deliver exceptional results by leveraging their trusted long-term relationships as highly relevant partners. We continue to enhance our commercial capabilities through rolling country level expansions of our field sales force to build on these results and to address the significant opportunities ahead of us. We've completed our expansions in Germany, France, and South Korea, and are seeing significant positive traction in instrument placements and CAG recurring revenue growth in these countries as a result. In addition, we are expanding our footprint in 3 additional countries as noted on our last call with hiring, on-boarding, and training tracking well to our plans in those areas. We expect to be live in all second-wave countries by the end of Q1 of next year. In addition to our commercial footprint, we made progress in the past quarter in expanding our service footprint and capabilities, in order to better support international business and customers. This included targeted investments to expand our European Reference Lab network and enhance our telemedicine service. These capabilities will support our long term growth goals by ensuring we meet our customers needs with a broad network and comprehensive portfolio of services. Complementing our world-class Reference Lab facility in corn west time Germany. These advancements support high-growth across our testing modalities as customers continue to take advantage of the flexibility offered by our customer - centric programs such as IDEXX 360 to grow their businesses and elevate standards of care around the world. Innovative products like ProCyte One are helping to build on this momentum. We've seen a very strong response to ProCyte One having delivered over 1,000 units worldwide since launch and on track for the approximately 4,000 annual worldwide premium hematology placement pace we shared during Investor Day. Feedback from customers of all sizes have been overwhelmingly positive, as a rave about ProCyte One's easy-to-use, low maintenance profile, and excellent performance. Our growth trajectory now reflects launches in all 4 of our major regions with a select number of country launches remaining in the fourth quarter of this year and into 2022. ProCyte One provides a great opportunity for increased engagement with customers, supporting strong adoption in its new platform globally, and the broader expansion of our business relationships. As an example, almost 95% worldwide ProCyte One placements and nearly a 100% in North America have either included a Catalyst One or have been placed at a customer that already has a Catalyst One, demonstrating the strong multiplier effect of this innovative product. Our Rapid Assay business is another area which provides an opportunity to expand relationships with customers around the globe. Rapid assay test revenues grew solidly in Q3 compared to a very strong prior-year. In 14% on a two-year basis with comparable gains in the U.S. and internationally. Vector-borne disease testing, a critical component of the rapid assay business and the wellness testing in the U.S. more broadly, was the primary driver of this growth as tick-borne disease becomes more prevalent in regions around the U.S. This testing growth continues to be supported by the SNAP Pro instrument, which helps drive engagement and loyalty through enhanced insight, accuracy, and practice workflow benefits. Double-digit growth in the SNAP Pro installed base in the U.S. and internationally in recent innovations like critical decision support, which aids increasingly busy veterinarians in making critical decisions when faced with a positive test, have helped drive excellent 97% customer retention levels within the Rapid Assay business. Our innovation strategy is also reflected in the expansion of our cloud-based software capabilities, which benefited from the Q2 acquisition of ezyVet. The integration of ezyVet into our software portfolio is proceeding to play out with high customer enthusiasm. ezyVet acquisition helped drive 33% reported growth of veterinary software, services and diagnostic imaging systems revenue in the third quarter, which was further supported by strong 15% organic growth in our core software and digital imaging products. This growth reflects solid double-digit year-over-year gains in our profitable recurring revenue software products. It also demonstrates the benefit of a growing installed base of PIMS in industry-leading low-dose diagnostic imaging products. Cloud-based offerings represent the majority of PIMS placements at over 80% as cloud-based offerings provide performance, quality, and life-cycle cost advantages. And within diagnostic imaging, recent updates to the Web PACS product include additional features important to specialty practices, and deeper, more seamless integrations with PIM systems. With a growing installed base and very high retention levels, IDEXX Web PACS has become an important part of our enterprise software ecosystem. Product enhancements like this and others aimed at making clinical workflow and customer communications easier and more efficient, are an impactful example of how our technology for life approach in supporting busy practices. Our commercial sales force and marketing teams continue to balance product sales with advancing the IDEXX Preventive Care program, which provides a structure and incentive for our customers continue driving wellness testing, and raising the standard of care. Enrollments in this program in the third quarter, despite constrained in-person discussions with customers sustained at a rate similar to the second quarter as we executed approximately 150 new preventive care enrollments and continue to track towards our goal of 10,000 engaged customers in the U.S. by 2024. In addition to strong commercial execution, our consistent growth trajectory also reflects the resiliency and agility in our supply chain. This has enabled us to weather the impacts of the COVID19 pandemic and meet the strong demand within our sector. IDEXX benefits from a number of factors related to our business, including strong long-term supplier relationships, year shoring and product standardization and inventory buffers. These factors in their proactive approach, managing front-line operational processes have allowed us to achieve 99% customer product availability through the pandemic, resulting in high customer satisfaction and increased retention. We believe we are well prepared to support sustained high-growth and service levels in our business going forward, where there may be relatively higher-cost in certain areas to support our growth plans. We're confident we can manage these impacts effectively through our operational capability and focus while building on our strong financial performance. Overall, we feel very positive about our continued strong business momentum as we engage with and support veterinarians around the world who are advancing the care standard. Looking forward, we are proceeding with plans for sustained high-growth aligned with our long-term growth potential. As current momentum positions us well to support investments in infrastructure, solutions, and commercial capabilities necessary to achieve the significant opportunity ahead of us, while delivering continued strong financial performance. Finally, I'd like to thank our employees and our customers for their perseverance and flexibility during these dynamic times. And extremely proud of what we've accomplished together. And look forward to continued excellence in the future. That concludes my remarks, and we now have time for questions. Operator : Thank you. And now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Michael Ryskin from Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : Thanks for taking the question guys. Had a lot of comments in the prepared remarks on strong instrument placement trends, particularly with ProCyte One, from the cross zone, you've been able to see there. Just wondering, are you able to see sequential acceleration there and any increased uptake of set of use, you could clarify on that, and just -- especially in some of those markets, you're seeing incremental competitive introductions by some of your peers. I'm just wondering if you could talk on dynamics and what you can go see from others in the marketplace. Jay Mazelsky : Good morning, Mike. The Q3 was a record placement really across our premium instruments, hematology, chemistry SediVue. And we think in part what's driving that is less pent-up demand and more practices really investing in their practice. That's because they're busy. They're looking for technology that can support productivity. and, obviously, greater patient flow. With respect to ProCyte One, you recalled we launched in the U.S. in late Q1, and then internationally in late Q2. And we've see n very rapid uptake that the majority of the ProCyte One -- the vast majority of the ProCyte One either have gone into competitive accounts with Catalyst or to existing Catalyst accounts. So it's a real customer pleaser. I think it's delivered on all aspects of the brand and product promise, easy use performance, great cost profile. Keep in mind it's also part of our pay-per-run and auto replenishment model. So it's a -- we're excited about the opportunity, if you recall from Investor Day we identified almost 100,000 placement opportunities globally. 2/3 plus of that internationally, we're just in the early days of getting started on that. So very promising outlook for hematology with respect to SediVue, we continue to make excellent progress in SediVue, obviously into replacements where we're high 30% plus. It's all nice uptake in the U.S., a nice sequential progress internationally. Michael Ryskin : Great, thanks. If I could ask a follow-up just on trends you saw over the course of 3Q and as we just think about 4Q. If we look at the snapshot in clinical visit growth and on revenues per visit, obviously you have the much tougher comps from a year prior, but as you continue going forward and so 4Q and 1Q next year, as we look at the 2-year stack comp on recurring CAG Diagnostics and total CAG revenue growth, are there any other dynamics we should be mindful of as we think of going into 4Q besides the comp dynamics? Anything else you're seeing in terms of changes in the marketplace or the gross volume growth things like that? Brian Mc Keon : Morning, Mike. I think the bigger theme that we're highlighting is the CAG Diagnostic recurring growth trend on a 2-year basis really held up quite well. In the third quarter as we -- as you know, you get into these year-on-year comparison dynamics that we're focusing a bit on the 2-year trend to calibrate. And that we saw the 16% 2-year average annual growth level both in U.S. and international. And I think that's also the premium on a 2-year basis held up very well. It was 1,200 basis points in Q3. So I think that is the bigger trend that aligns with the higher end of our revenue growth outlook. And that's informing our posture heading into next year that we're really planning for sustained strong growth. We're investing towards that, ensuring that we have high service levels. So in terms of broader trends, I think Jay can provide some color, but I think the clinical visit trend was moderated a bit from the first half on a 2-year basis. We may be seeing some plateauing of the incremental growth benefit we saw from the step-up in new pets. Although the pet population has expanded and sustained and perhaps it might be reflective of victims clinics just being quite easy, but I think it was quite overall modest and our own trends have held up quite well. Jay Mazelsky : Just to build on that, Mike. All indications there that demand in the marketplace and the trends remain very strong in a -- clearly, the 1 year growth rate held up quite well. If you think back to Q3 in 2020, there's a lot of pent-up demand. There was increased pet patient visits. So really nice growth across tough compares the 2-year clinical visit trends as we've talked about it, 4.4% is clearly above pre -pandemic levels at 2% to 3%. And then if you take a look at how we've translated that in our own business, 60% in a globally CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue, U.S. and internationally. Those are 2-year figures. We've seen nice growth across all modalities, whether you look at the 1-year or 2-year. And I think our execution as a Company has been excellent. So the -- I think the growth momentum remains quite strong and as Brian indicated, we're really positioned to support faster growth by expanding capabilities commercially, innovation, really expanding the resiliency and capacity of our supply chain and manufacturing network. Michael Ryskin : Great thank you so much. John Ravis : Our next question is from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Maybe following up on the last one. Jay or Brian, could you maybe -- how do you feel about vet practice capacity right now? I don't know if you feel like there are any labor shortages that are impacting just overall volumes of vet clinics. But it'd be great to get your perspective on where you think vet practices are operating at this point. Jay Mazelsky : Good morning Nathan. Vet practices are clearly very busy. They -- there are a number of things that they've done, I think on a short-term basis, to be able to provide additional capacity of -- a lot of practices are working longer hours, they're hiring more staff and on a short-term basis, they can hire, let's say associate veterinary technicians and train them. The more trained higher-level skilled staff obviously takes a bit more time. A number of practices have been able to really improve mix of workflow improvements and adjust capacity just by adding things like exam rooms and things like that. From the standpoint of what we can do as a Company, there's another -- there's a number of really, I think, positive opportunities for us. Obviously, we provide technologies, analyzers, tools, software that practices can invest in that help them perform both at a higher medical or clinical level. But also more productively whether its communications or internally or with pet owners, or really improving staff productivity. I think evidence of that is to me, very significant step-up in instrument placements that we've seen and very fast-growth in software PIMS systems and ancillary systems that work with PIMS. Nathan Rich : Great. That's helpful. And maybe a follow-up for Brian. What -- how should we think about the right baseline level for operating margins as we head into next year? The cadence this year has been a bit unusual with the elevated margins in the first half of the year. I think the back half. The guidance implies maybe around 26%. And maybe talked about the investments. But could you maybe flush out sort of what you think the right starting point is for as we think about the margin trajectory into 2022? Thank you. Brian Mc Keon : Sure. On a full-year basis, I think we said 28.8% to 29%. We do have some quarterly differences in margins normally, I think Q2 tends to be our highest with just some of the wellness testing that goes on Rapid Assay sales and things of that nature. I think we feel good about the growth trajectory in the business, particularly the growth on the CAG recurring revenues that's a key driver for us, and that really gives us the ability to reinvest and into -- to build on the margin performance that we've had. I think we are intending to invest. We have been investing in growth aligned with the higher growth profile and we want to build on that. We see that as a very high return area for us, particularly, areas like commercial investment. We get a very quick payback on that. And we're really pleased with the progress we had in our initial wave of international markets. And we'll look to do more with that next year. We'll provide more clarity on that as we get into the year, but our goal is to build on the strong performance that we have this year. And the strong growth trajectory in the business really gives us an opportunity to do that. Operator : And our next question is from Jon Block, from Stifel. Jon Block : Great, thanks, guys. Good morning. Brian maybe just to start, the gross margin trend, it was down for the third consecutive quarter. And I know you called out some mix headwinds, ongoing investments, but just want to go back to the big deck from the Analyst Day. You talked about gross margin, I'll frame it as that double up green arrow long term. And so I'm just curious, does that double up green arrow take hold in '22 or should we think about some of these investments really spilling out into the next several quarters? Brian Mc Keon : Okay, John. I think it's important to calibrate at just what we're working through, if you go back to last year. And at just looking at our numbers and year-over-year improvement on a comparable basis. We were up over 200 basis points in Q2 - Q3 last year. We're comparing to some higher numbers in terms of the levels we were at last year where we had really constrained cost conditions. And I think the -- that's a key factor we are investing back now and we're seeing that paying off in terms of high service levels and growth. I think we had some impacts from mix through the X1 instrument placement growth has a little bit of a mix headwind for us. And those are factors we're working through. But I think the overall dynamics in margins are something that we believe we can build upon. We'll provide more insight into that as we get into next year. But I think that longer-term trend, the key driver there is our strong CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth rates. And we are well-positioned to build on that with the trends that we've seen in the business so I think that longer-term story still holds for us. Jon Block : Okay. And then just a follow-up. Maybe we just push you a little bit on the '22 trends in CAG curing and the 16% CAG recurring 2-year average has been remarkably consistent for the first 3 quarters of '21. The guide implies a slight step down in the fourth quarter of '21. And is that slight deceleration the way to think about the CAG Dx 2-year slope as we head into '22 and to maybe layer on top of that, is there an opportunity for you guys, for price to play a bigger role in CAG Dx into '22, just based on what we hear from some of the practices on their recent ability to realize price? Thanks, guys. Brian Mc Keon : We didn't provide specific guidance on Q4, but I can tell you that our high-end of our range is consistent with the trends that we've seen on a 2-year basis on CAG Diagnostic recurring for the first 3 quarters. So that is reflected in a guidance. The overall organic growth, just keep in mind, we're up against a little tougher concurrent instruments in Q4. It's not a change in trend. It's just we're working through some compares there. But it's -- again the high-end is largely consistent with where we've been trending. I think that we're going to learn more on this as we move forward. I think the -- we're really pleased with the execution in the business. I think the momentum on our key initiatives, particularly things like instruments, give us a lot of confidence that we can build on. The strong consumable growth, and I think our execution to other modalities is very strong as well. And we're watching the market trends and I think that it's very encouraging. I think there -- like I said, there may be some moderation in terms of the step-up in things like pet population growth and we've got to pay attention to capacity at clinics and things like that, but those are good problems that we think we can help our customers with. So we're -- I think that's a key theme. Hopefully you here today is the trends of the business we're very pleased with, particularly in CAG business, and we -- we're looking to invest to build on them. Jon Block : In that price realization Brian, if I can just circle back on that -- sorry do you think that one's a bigger opportunity? Brian Mc Keon : Sorry about that, John. So we've been in that 2% to 3% range. I think that -- hey, look, I think that is an area that we were going to continue to look at. Pet owners are willing to pay more for services over time. There may be some select inflationary pressures in the business here and things like some input costs on labor and freight. And so we're paying attention to that. I think it is something we can look at over time if we see some sustained impacts on those fronts. And like I said, I think the market backdrop -- the industry backdrop gives us an opportunity to look at that just given the strength of the pet owner bond. Jon Block : Perfect. Thanks, guys. John Ravis : Our next question is from Chris Scott from JPMorgan. Chris Scott : Great. Thanks so much. Just this 2 for me. I guess, first on in-person, that access. I think you mentioned in-person access now in the 50% to 60% range. As that number moves higher, is that a meaningful benefit for your business or have you found that you were able to do pretty much everything you need to do given the access as it is today. And I just had 1 follow-up after that. Jay Mazelsky : Good morning, Chris. We -- we're up around 60% in the U.S, 50% outside of the U.S. And we think that can grow. The net will be higher as we work through the -- hopefully, what's the tail end of the pandemic. I think we've gotten very good at really segmenting what should be done or what is best on, in-person versus virtually. We've been able to -- I think pretty much do all what we need to do virtually. But there are some activities like whether you're introducing a product or visiting competitive accounts in building. And I think strengthening relationships are better done in person. So we think that over time that we'll get a increase. It's not going to go back to 100%, but it'll be something less than that. I think it will benefit our preventive care initiative, where we know practices are not only very busy, but I think repeated access is helpful in being able to sell and partner with customers. With that program, do we expect over time that right step-up to pre -pandemic levels. Chris Scott : Okay, great. And then just come back to the top of inflation. Just what do you think about this kind of new inflationary environment? Are you seeing or do you expect to see in the near-term any gross or operating margin pressures to this? I think you mentioned that if this is more sustained, there might be an opportunity within -- on the price side to address, but I'm just trying to think in the nearer term, is that something that's noticeable in the numbers or is there abilities to offset that elsewhere in the business? Brian Mc Keon : This is, Brian, the -- we have seen some inflationary impacts on the business. I think it's been more in areas like freight and distribution, which I think a lot of companies are experiencing. And for us, it's a relatively select on input costs, things like electronics and in resins, and we're paying attention to labor costs as well. I think those are all important areas for us. We've been able to manage through those effects well and we're really focused on sustaining high levels service for our customers, particularly in this high growth market. So that's our focus and our intent and I think we're confident that we can build on the profit trends that we've had while managing through those kind of effects on our business. Chris Scott : Great. Thanks so much. John Ravis : Our next question is from Ryan Daniels, from William Blair. Mitch: Hey guys, Mitch speaking for Ryan. Thanks for taking my question. I guess to start, given the lack of bandwidth in the [Indiscernible] in the constraint on the capacity, has it affected the selling process and things like product education? Is that affected negatively at all or have you been able to work around that? Jay Mazelsky : Yes. Good morning. As I had previously indicated, practices are extremely busy and it has affected how we do our sales calls. Once upon time you could get a fair amount of time with the veterinarian and her staff workers -- her staff and I think we've -- we try to be very efficient. And what -- previously we may have had 40 minutes or 50 minutes, now we're able to accomplish in 20. So we've adjusted accordingly where have provided tools to our sales organization so that they're productive and they can get to the point. And we continue to provide a lot of training including CE Training virtually into the webinar to our customers, so that they can get the training they need when they have some free windows and moments. We try to be, obviously, respectful, but very efficient when we could call it practices. And because I think most practice and practice owners consider as highly relevant to their success. They, at large measure, provide time when we meet with them. And I think with good results. Mitch: Great thanks. Brian, on the capital instruments side of things, would you say you worked your way through most of the back-fill, and a lot of this growth is now incremental, practices realizing that they need an addition of a ProCyte or an additional Catalyst or that sort of thing? Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. I think this is that the capital performance we've seen is not pent-up demand, it really represents Investments. The practices are making in their capacity and really improve capacity and productivity of their practices. So I think it's just a solid reflection of demand trends. Mitch: Great, thanks. John Ravis : Our next question from Balaji Prasad from Barclays. Balaji Prasad : Hi. Good morning, and thanks for the questions. Couple of them. Firstly, all that you did comment on increased testing for ASF, I wanted to understand if you have visibility into what has led to this, and see if there's any broader read through to ASF trends. In other words, can an increase in testing signal that ASF in sense of spiking up -- spiking gain? Secondly, I'm not sure about this, but obviously in any supply chain disruptions and reach off your segments would be or could be most exposed to the current global supply chain challenges? And lastly if you can, can you just help us understand the CAG dynamics better? Trying to correlate the same-store revenue growth, which is 5% points above the visit growth of 2%. So is this all linked to higher utilization or was there any component of pricing which is above normal trends? Thank you. Brian Mc Keon : Why don't I take your first question on African swine fever. The primary dynamics we've seen around our China business for LPD, we saw a significant step-up in program testing in support of addressing African swine fever to last year and -- but those trends have changed. There are changes in the local management of the disease in China where there is now harvesting of the -- local farmers are allowed to harvest the animals rather than -- so that's leading them to harvest them rather than treat the disease. So there's been a decline in demand and that's raised some compares for us. So for our business, that's been the primary impact on African swine fever. And we're anticipating that's going to be a -- continue to be a challenge for us year-over-year for some upcoming quarters. Jay Mazelsky : And I'll speak to the supply chain. I think resiliency and performance of the business, which has been excellent. As I previously indicated, we have an excellent long-term supplier relationships. We've been able to leverage those and they make sure that we're very well provided. We also -- most of our manufacturing or almost all of our manufacturing is local where you're assured that we have a great deal of product standardization. We have maintained high inventory buffers. So we've been able to really support very high product availability throughout the pandemic. Our customers have clearly appreciated that, and have rewarded us with their business. So we feel very positive about our ability to continue to do that going forward. Brian Mc Keon : I believe your third question was on utilization at the clinic level, and -- Jay Mazelsky : Right. Brian Mc Keon : -- what we point out at if that was those correct is the year-over-year basis. Again, you get into these compares with last year, we had a big step-up and wellness testing and pent-up demand. The big -- the bigger driver of growth in the third quarter year-over-year was utilization growth. So the utilization gains at the clinic level have remained quite strong and on a two-year basis, good one-year growth. And it was more than offset on a flat frequency that was more related to the year-on-year compares in terms of the testing of number of visits. Jay Mazelsky : Okay. And with that, I'd like to thank everybody for calling in. I'd also like to address the broader IDEXX team, some of which are on the call and say thank you for their continued extraordinary performance. Our employees have demonstrated an admirable commitment to our purpose and excellent ability to execute against our strategy. And I truly appreciate all their efforts. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. And you may now disconnect.",

In reviewing our Fourth Quarter 2021 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth, and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2020, unless otherwise noted. To allow broad participation in the Q&A we ask that each participants limit their questions to one with one follow-up as necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into queue and if time permits, we'll take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results and to provide an overview of our financial outlook for 2022. In terms of highlights, IDEXX delivered excellent financial performance in Q4 driven by double digit top line gains compared to very strong prior year results. Revenue increased 11% as reported and 10.5%, organically supported by 13% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Two year average annual organic growth for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues was approximately 17% across U.S. and international regions, consistent with the accelerated two year growth trends seen throughout 2021. We achieved record premium instrument placements in Q4 with strong gains across our major platforms supporting a 14% year-on-year expansion of our global premium instrument base. Strong revenue growth enabled delivery of $1.89 and EPS up 12% on a comparable basis as we advanced planned investments in our commercial and innovation capability. Closer benefits from high organic revenue growth in 2021 drove outstanding full year financial performance above our long term goals. IDEXX achieved 16% overall organic revenue growth for the full year, driven by 18% gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Full year operating margins reached 29%, an increase of 220 basis points on a comparable basis. And we delivered full year EPS of $8.60 per share up 29% on a comparable basis. We're well-positioned to build on the strong financial performance in 2022. We're targeting revenue gains at the higher end of our long term goals reflected in our outlook for 10% to 12% overall organic revenue growth and 12% to 14% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. We're also targeting a 50 to 100 basis point improvement in operating margins on a comparable basis, building on the strong profit gains through the pandemic as we continue to invest towards the long term development of companion animal healthcare globally. Our EPS outlook of $9.27 to $9.59 per share, reflects 12% to 16%, comparable EPS growth, including an estimated $0.15 per share, or 2% EPS growth impact related to higher projected international tax rates. We'll discuss our 2022 financial outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter and full year results. Fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 10.5% was driven by 13% overall CAG gains and 13% growth in our water business. These gains were moderated as expected by a 19% organic decline in LPD revenues, reflecting comparisons to high prior year results that benefited from the ramping of African swine fever testing in China, as well as by a $5 million year-on-year decline in human COVID PCR testing revenues. Strong CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth reflected 13% organic gains across U.S. and international regions, compared to 21% organic growth levels in the fourth quarter of 2020. Strong Q4 CAG results were also supported by 21% gains in IDEXX VetLab instrument revenues and 13% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues in addition to benefits from a recent ezyVet acquisition. For the full year 2021 overall CAG revenues increased 19% organically driven by 18% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, reflecting high gains across our major modalities and regions. Strong U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth in the fourth quarter was aided by solid year-on-year gains in clinical visits and continued positive demand trends which are supporting high levels of clinical revenue growth at the practice level. Same-store U.S. clinical visit growth was 2.2% in Q4, compared to high prior year growth levels. On a two year basis U.S. same-store clinical visits increased at 5.5% with solid gains across wellness and non-wellness categories. An increased focus on healthcare services including diagnostics supported an 8% same-store increase in overall veterinary clinic revenues in Q4 and nearly 10% gains in clinical diagnostic revenues which increased 14% on an average two year basis. Expanding demand for clinical services and benefits from IDEXX innovation and commercial engagement supported a 1050 basis point premium of IDEXX U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth to U.S. clinical visit growth in the quarter. In terms of practice level trends, we did see some modest impact from the recent Omicron wave on clinical testing volumes in international regions in Q4 which has continued in early 2022. We've also seen some moderation in clinic visit growth in January in the U.S. including near term impacts from higher COVID cases on practice level staffing. We're monitoring these dynamics which we don't see as indicative of changes in strong underlying demand trends. Globally, IDEXX achieved strong organic gains across our major testing modalities in Q4 resulting in exceptional full year growth results. IDEXX global reference lab revenues increased 12% organically in Q4 reflecting double digit gains in the U.S. and high single digit organic growth in international regions compared to strong prior year growth levels. Referenced lab gains continue to be driven by solid same-store volume growth including benefits from the expansion of IDEXX 360 program agreements. For the full year 2021 global lab revenues increased 70% organically reflecting consistent high gains across U.S. and international regions. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 15% on an organic basis in Q4 reflecting double digit gains across U.S. and international regions. Strong consumable growth reflects increases in testing utilization, sustained high customer retention levels, and expansion of our global premium instrument installed base. These dynamics supported 20% full year organic growth at IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues in 2021. IDEXX had another quarter of outstanding instrument placements building on this momentum. We achieved 5,258 premium instrument placements in Q4 up 29% from prior year levels, reflecting robust gains across U.S. and international regions. We achieved strong global placement growth across our major platforms year-on-year with catalyst up 8%, SediVue up 20% and premium hematology up 72% supported by the continued global rollout of ProCyte One. The breadth and quality of CAG instrument placements supported strong gains in our economic value metric. New instrument placements and continued very high customer retention levels drove a 14% increase in our global premium instrument installed base in 2021 setting a foundation for continued strong consumable growth as we move forward. Rapid assay revenue increased 10% organically in Q4 reflecting continued solid gains in the U.S. aligned with broader increases in demand for diagnostic testing and high growth in international regions. For the full year 2021 Rapid Assay organic revenue growth was 17% supported by high volume gains for canine, 4Dx, feline and specialty testing. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth remains primarily volume driven augmented by moderate net price improvement of approximately 3% in key regions like the U.S. Looking ahead to 2022 we're planning for net price improvement in the range of 3% to 4% reflecting higher list price increases to reflect higher service costs, and continued investment in service quality and product innovation. In other areas of our CAG business our veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 13% organically and 30% as reported in Q4 including benefits from the ezyVet acquisition. Continued strong gains and recurring software and diagnostic imaging services and high comparable growth in PIMS placements were moderated to a degree by tough compares related to strong prior year diagnostic imaging placements. For the full year 2021 veterinary, software and diagnostic imaging revenues expanded to over $200 million up 15% organically and 27% as reported as we continue to advance integration of information technology and insight as a key feature of our diagnostic solutions. Turning to other business segments, water revenues increased 13% organically in Q4 compared to flat organic growth in last year's fourth quarter as this business continues to track back towards pre COVID growth levels. Business growth was supported by solid gains across compliance and non-compliance testing categories. For the full year 2021 water revenues increased 12% organically compared to a 2% organic decline in 2020. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenues decreased 90% organically in Q4 compared to 13% organic growth levels in Q4 of 2020. As expected dynamics in our China LPD business including the lapping of high prior year demand for African swine fever testing, offset growth and other global regions. For the full year 2021 LPD revenues declined 9% organically compared to 11% gains in 2020. We're planning for continued challenging year-on-year compares and LPD revenues in the first half of 2022 which is factored into our overall revenue outlook. Turning to the P&L. Sustained high revenue growth drove solid operating profit gains compared to strong prior levels as we advanced plan investments aligned with our growth strategy. Operating profits increased 8% as reported and 9% on a comparable basis in Q4 driven by continued solid gross profit gains. Gross profit increased 12% in the quarter, reflecting strong revenue growth at a modest overall increase in gross margins. We benefited from continued high CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth, moderate net price improvement, and higher veterinary software margins, including positive impacts from or expanding SaaS customer base. These factors were moderated by business mix impacts from high CAG instrument revenue growth, and lower LPD and human PCR revenues. Operating expenses increased 15% on a reported and comparable basis in Q4. As planned, we saw relatively higher levels of operating expense growth as we advanced investments in R&D, enhanced our global CAG sales and marketing capability and integrated the ezyVet acquisition. We anticipate sustaining a relatively higher rate of OpEx growth in 2022 aligned with our strong global growth momentum. Operating expense investments drove a 70 basis point contraction in comparable operating margins in Q4. For the full year 2021 our operating margins reached 29% up 220 basis points on a comparable basis for the year and up approximately 560 basis points on a comparable basis from pre-pandemic levels in 2019. We're targeting to build on the strong performance in 2022 as we invest towards the high return, long term growth potential in our business. Q4 EPS was $1.89 per share, including $0.08 per share a tax benefit related to share based compensation activity. For the full year 2021 EPS was $8.60 up 29% on a comparable basis. Full year EPS results included $32 million or $0.38 per share in tax benefit related to share based compensation activity, which provided 360 basis points of effective tax rate benefits. Foreign exchange effects reduced revenue growth by approximately 1% in Q4 resulting in a $0.02 per share profit impact net of a hedged loss of approximately $500,000. For the full year 2021 foreign exchange rate changes increased EPS by $0.16 per share net of foreign exchange hedge losses of $7 million. Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar we're planning for 1.5% FX revenue growth headwind in 2022 with approximately 2% to 2.5% year-on-year growth headwinds in the first half. Well, previously established hedge positions will mitigate these impacts on profits, our initial 2022 outlook incorporates an estimated $0.08 net unfavorable EPS impact from the FX at the rates noted in our press release. Free cash flow was $636 million for 2021 or approximately 85% of net income reflecting a $120 million in capital spending including $18 million in real estate purchases. We maintained a strong balance sheet. We ended 2021 with leverage ratios of 0.9 times gross and 0.7 times net of cash with $144 million in cash at the end of the year. In Q4 we established a new five year $1 billion revolving credit facility which provides relatively improved borrowing rates. Our 2022 interest expense outlook incorporate these benefits, current forward interest rates and expectations for a net leverage ratio of one times next year. In Q4, we allocated $245 million to repurchase 391,000 shares in the quarter. We plan to continue to allocate capital to share repurchases as part of our financial approach which is reflected in a projected 1% to 1.5% reduction in our diluted shares outstanding for the full year 2022. Turning towards 2022 outlook we are providing initial guidance for reported revenues of 3.5 billion to 3.565 billion. This outlook reflects a targeted organic revenue growth range of 10% to 12%, carryover benefits of approximately 0.5% from 2021 acquisitions and an estimated 1.5% revenue growth headwind from FX. Our organic growth outlook reflects an estimated growth range of 12% to 14% for CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. The higher end of this range aligns with sustaining the strong year-on-year growth trends we achieved exiting 2021 and incorporates additional targeted benefits for a moderately higher net price realization and investments in global CAG sector development. Our overall organic growth outlook also factors in continued benefits from expansion of our premium instrument installed base and solid growth in our water business. These positive factors are partially offset by expectations for continued year-on-year pressure on LPD revenues in the first half of 2022 and a projected contraction in human PCR testing revenues reflecting our overall strategic growth focus on our core businesses. Our reported operating margin outlook for full year 2022 is 29.7% to 30.2% reflecting a targeted 50 to 100 basis points of annual comparable operating margin improvement building on our strong operating margin gains in recent years. We expect operating margin improvement will be supported by solid gross margin gains as we advanced investments in our global commercial and innovation capability and ensure high levels of operational business continuity as a priority. We've incorporated anticipated inflationary cost impacts, as well as benefits from relatively higher net price gains in our overall operating margin outlook. Given exit rates in our OpEx spending and year-on-year operating profit comparison dynamics, we're planning for operating margin improvements to be primarily driven by gains in the second half of 2022. Our preliminary EPS outlook for 2022 is $9.27 to $9.59 per share an increase of 8% to 11% as reported. Our EPS outlook factors in effect -- it increase in our overall effective tax rate from 17.5% to an estimated 21.5% to 22% in 2022. Approximately 100 to 150 basis points of this increase relates to projected impacts from international tax changes. We're also projecting lower tax benefits from share based tax compensation activity. Our EPS outlook reflects projected 2022 stock based compensation tax benefits of $10 million or approximately $0.12 per share compared to high realized 2021 tax benefits of $32 million or $0.38 per share. As noted, we've also incorporated an estimated year on year negative impact of $0.8 per share from FX, net of establish hedge positions. Adjusting for these factors our outlook is for EPS growth of 12% to 16% on a comparable basis, including an estimated $0.15 per share approximately 2% EPS growth impact from international tax rate changes. Our 2022 free cash flow outlook was for a net income to free cash flow conversion ratio of 75% to 80%. This reflects estimated capital spending of 180 million or approximately 5% of revenues, including $50 million related to a new warehouse and manufacturing site expansion aligned to support our high growth. Adjusting for this major project, our normalized net income to free cash flow conversion ratio is aligned with our longer term 80% to 90% targets. That concludes our financial view. I will now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Jay Mazelsky : Thank you, Brian. And good morning. IDEXX sustained a strong performance in Q4 capping an exceptional year for the company. For the full year we delivered 16% organic revenue growth, 29% comparable EPS growth supported by solid operating margin games and 59% ROI fee. These results reflect the attractiveness of our businesses including our core CAG business which is sustaining very strong growth trends benefiting from our commercial expansion in an expanding innovation portfolio. We're well-positioned to build on this momentum in 2022 as reflected in our financial outlook. This morning I'll recap our recent performance and highlight key areas of business focus moving forward including advancement of new innovations in the ongoing expansion of our global commercial capabilities. Both of these are strategic elements of our plan to develop the substantial long term market opportunity still before us. Let me begin with a brief update on sector trends. Overall global companion animal healthcare trends remain strong driven by ongoing robust demand at veterinary clinics for healthcare services, including diagnostics. As Brian highlighted U.S. same-store clinical revenues increased 8% in Q4 supported by 2% growth in same-store clinical visits compared to very strong prior year growth levels. Diagnostic same-store growth continues to expand at a higher pace of nearly 10%. IDEXX U.S. CAG diagnostics recurring revenue growth is leading this expansion reflected in 13% organic gains in Q4 building on 21% gains in Q4 of 2020 as we provide highly desired diagnostics and information management platforms that support our customers care mission. We're seeing sustained strong demand transfer clinic, clinical service globally, building on the step up achieved through the pandemic. As highlighted and data shared in our earning snapshot this includes sustained approximately 2% acceleration in U.S. diagnostics revenue per clinical visit in 2021 building on higher 2020 gains. The solid momentum gives us confidence in investing towards accelerated global CAG sector development and is reflected in our outlook of 12% to 14% global CAG diagnostics recurring revenue gains in 2022 at the high end of our long term goals. Like many sectors of the global economy veterinary clinics continue to work through the challenging dynamic of increased clinical demand in the face of staffing challenges including near term management impacts from the surge of the Omicron variant. It's clear that strong clinical service demand will be a priority for clinics moving forward. IDEXX remains committed and extremely well-positioned to support the growth of our customers through our focus on high customer service levels and solutions that enhance clinic productivity. As we look forward, we're expanding our global commercial capability aligned with the strong demand trends. Our investments in Germany, France and South Korea in the first half of 2021 continue to pay off as expanded commercial footprints in each country enabled significant increases in customer contacts and reach to revenue critical elements of our high touch and account management philosophy. We're tracking towards completion in early 2022 of the already communicated second wave of expansions in three additional countries with more to come. These are holistic initiatives that only involve the addition of customer facing professionals across multiple job types such as account managers, professional service veterinarians, and field service representatives but also include the extension of marketing programs and new field tools such as IDEXX 360 and the addition of more extensive reference of [core] roots and expanded service levels. Increasing our international commercial footprint while maturing our approach will continue to be a key priority beyond wave two countries currently nearing completion. To that end, I'm pleased to share that we are also augmenting our commercial leadership team with an experienced commercial executive in Asia-Pacific CAG, who will join that excess quarter. As we expand, our commercial team continues to deliver the day reflected in over 5000 premium instrument placements in Q4 by far our largest quarterly placements ever achieved. Premium instrument placement growth of 29% includes comparable growth across U.S. and international regions, and resulted in 14% growth in our global premium install base with strong performance across each of our instrument platforms. These exceptional results were delivered despite excess challenges. They demonstrate strong commercial execution as well as the fact that customers are increasingly choosing IDEXX innovations to support increased clinical demand today, while investing for future business needs. ProCyte One is a great example of this. Our ProCyte One launch has done exceptionally well. ProCyte One's performance and reliability is used for the demanding environment of a practice has met or exceeded all goals and feedback remains highly positive as customers love it\u2019s easy to use and how it fits into the veterinary clinic workflow. We see mid 90% global attach rates with chemistry analyzers in this trend demonstrate ProCyte One's importance in building a full diagnostic workup. Furthermore, the ProCyte One launch benefits from programs like IDEXX 360, which not only provides veterinarians with a flexible, customer friendly way to add this innovative analyzer to their clinics, but also benefits growth across IDEXX testing modalities. Our global ProCyte One regional [route] is now nearly complete and we have delivered over 2500 instruments globally since launching in late Q1 of 2021. A growing installed base of premium instruments supports a robust range of future consumable usage, which gives us confidence and guided ranges for CAG recurring revenue growth. In addition to driving placements and adoption. Our commercial team continues to educate our customers on the benefits of preventive medicine. The preventive care initiative remains our primary vehicle for driving a preventive agenda in the clinic, and provide sales professionals an opportunity to engage in thorough conversations with broad participation from practice staff. Despite restricted access to clinics, we drove approximately 125 new U.S. enrollments in the quarter while also developing plans to simplify the enrollment process for busy customers. And we look forward to deploying this and continuing to support this broader preventive care effort in 2022. We also see continued momentum in software expansion as our innovative products helping customers improve clinic efficiency and pet owner communication. The onboarding of ezyVet has gone very smoothly and subscriptions are tracking favorably to our high expectations. Customers appreciate the advanced capabilities and intuitive workflow ezyVet provides. 81% of PIMS placements were cloud based in the quarter, demonstrating that we are well-positioned to support customers in their shift to the cloud. This trend provides a significant growth opportunity and excellent profit flow. It puts robust and easy to use information management products at the hands of our customers that enable them to focus on providing the highest levels of patient care enabled by diagnostics to improve health outcomes. Our software portfolio is a strategic area of investment and focus for IDEXX. Veterinarians have never been busier and have a deep need and appreciation for software solutions that are easy to use and built on contemporary technology stacks. They look to these solutions to support patient care, staff productivity and internal as well as pet owner communications. Our strategy is to bring enterprise PIM software solutions to our customers that work seamlessly with a broader set of business and clinical applications. Our own or third parties that veterinarians used to run their practices VetConnect PLUS diagnostics results clinical decision support and ordering portal is a great example of this. VetConnect PLUS was launched almost 10 years ago. It's integrated from a workflow standpoint in IDEXX in third party PIMs it is now being used in over 30,000 practices globally. Customers who use our software and diagnostic solutions together correlate with higher growth profiles supporting workflow optimization for our diagnostics testing platforms. Our diagnostic imaging business which includes our industry leading Web PAC software solution also experienced an excellent quarter, demonstrating the preference customers have for our premier low dose imaging solutions. Solid placements in the quarter supported full year placement growth of 35% and double digit year-over-year gains in recurring revenue. We also had strong growth in Web PAC subscriptions for Q4 up 18% versus the prior year and with continued customer retention rates and high 90% range growth in the installed base a profitable revenue stream and increased utilization of services have helped IDEXX webpacks become an important part of our enterprise software ecosystem. In addition to ensuring the successful rollout and adoption of these recent innovations, we were thrilled to launch a series of new product and service enhancements in BMX last month. Each of these innovations highlight IDEXX's commitment to continually invest in our service and product offerings with a particular focus on providing insights and decision making aids to help customers deliver a higher standard of patient care. These enhancements include an expanded oncology testing platform with additional tests that aid for veterinarians to better identify, stage, treat and monitor several prevalent cancer types and updated 4Dx plus tests with improved parameter performance for Anaplasma and the addition of clinical decision support 4Dx plus and neuro network 6.0 for SediVue which has now been trained on 800 million urine sediment images. Improving the performance of our products is central to our strategy and we're also supporting greater efficiency which helps drive higher adoption and customer satisfaction. Some examples; the new catalyst SDMA brings reagents onboard the test, reducing the number of steps to run the test and time to results while also reducing storage space and waste due to the removal of separate reagent comps. The improved VetConnect PLUS mobile app provides an enhanced user experience, improve the mobile capability and easier pet owner communication and finally coming later in 2022 our 4Dx plus test will allow for extended room temperature storage. The addition of these time saving technologies demonstrates our technology for life approach to product and services designs. Notably, the improved 4Dx Plus product represents our fifth update to the [indiscernible] product first launched in 1992. While this test already represents the gold standard for vector borne disease rapid testing, we remain focused on continuous improvement to support our customers in delivering improved pet health outcomes. Underpinning our strong business performance, it's a prioritized focus on providing continued high level service to our customers. A key element in achieving these service levels is consistent strong execution across our supply chain which we saw again in Q4 through high product availability and strong order turnaround times. In order to build this capability and support growth in the future, we plan to invest in 2022 in the expansion of our manufacturing footprint in lab capacity, while also maintaining strong frontline measures to support high service levels. And while we anticipate some inflationary dynamics in supply chain headwinds going forward, we've captured these impacts in our outlook, and believe we are well positioned to build upon our year end margins. Overall, we're very pleased with the momentum and execution in our business and excited about our plans to build on our progress in 2022. Before we open the line for Q&A, I'd like to say thanks to our employees for another top notch year end in pursuit of our purpose and service to our customers. The IDEXX organization remained highly focused on our customers\u2019 needs and continued to perform at a very high level during another dynamic and demanding year. The team's perseverance is seen both in the results highlighted this morning, as well as our high levels of engagement as a team. And I'm proud to be able to share today's excellent results on behalf of the whole team's hard work. That concludes my opening remarks. We now have time for some questions. Operator : Thank you and now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Great, thanks so much for the questions. I just want to get a little bit more color on the magnitude of impact you're seeing from Omicron to the near term results. So basically how much of a step down in visits are you seeing currently? And then maybe just following on that just kind of broader question, can you just elaborate a little bit more on your expectation for vet visit growth as we look out to 2022 and we start to think about annualizing maybe more normalized comps that we've seen over the past few years. Thanks so much. Jay Mazelsky : Good morning, Chris. We haven't quantified it. We did see some impact on testing volumes in the international regions from Omicron, in late Q4. It primarily manifested itself in the modest drop off in some lab volumes. And this trend appears to be continuing just in early \u201822 January as it affects the U.S. clinical visit growth. The thing to keep in mind is the underlying customer demand is very strong. What vet practices tell us is that they're busy as they ever been in terms of forward booking. We're seeing month, two month forward booking of patients and [impediments] (ph) just trying to get into practices. So we think practices have a playbook in which to deal with this. We've all seen this movie a couple times at this point. They've done the curbside drop off and pickup. In some cases there's obviously some staffing issues that they're dealing with, we think that that\u2019s more of a temporary basis. And we're in a really good position also to be able to support them with our field service, organization and technology solutions that help them be more productive and manage that business. Brian McKeon : And to your question Chris our 12% to 14% organic growth outlook for CAG Dx recurring revenues assumes positive clinic visit growth in addition to strong performance, ongoing performance by our teams and helping to grow our revenues faster than that. Chris Schott : And maybe just one really quick follow up. I know, last year, you talked about new instrument placement growth adding I think about a percent or so to overall revenue growth. Can you just elaborate on how you're thinking about new instrument placements and its contribution to 2022? Thanks so much. Brian McKeon : I'll let Jay talk to the color of the momentum that we have on instrument placements in our priorities. In terms of our outlook we didn't break it out, specifically what we're targeting continued strong placement growth. The revenue growth may lag the placement growth somewhat as we see the expansion of programs like IDEXX 360 and have some mix effects from higher growth in international markets, but we're targeting solid instrument year-on-year growth and that's factored into the overall guidance. Jay Mazelsky : We saw record placements in Q4 of 2021 over 5,000 on the back of record hematology placements in catalyst and SediVue, pretty much across the board. And we think that that momentum will remain intact. Practices are clearly investing in technology to help them from a capacity standpoint. They are looking to us and our solutions that not just support the best standard of care but also support workflow and staff productivity and enable them to handle higher patient volumes. Chris Schott : Okay. Thanks so much for the questions. Operator : Our next question is from Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley. Erin Wright : Great, thanks so much. In the inflationary environment that we're in and you anticipate higher price realization in the 2022 guide. But can you quantify some of the offsetting factors, the higher input costs, labor freight, net net how are these dynamics impacting you from a margin perspective in 2022, just based on your guidance? Brian McKeon : So we are seeing some impacts selectively in our business. I think you highlighted some of the key drivers, but freight and distribution costs have been a factor. We are monitoring higher labor input costs. I think that's something that we anticipate will be something we'll need to manage effectively. And we have selective impacts in different parts of our business, but we do use electronic components and things of that nature. I think a lot of our focus, Erin is on making sure we have continued very high business continuity, reliability. So we're really pleased with that. We're at 99% and customer reliability and that's our primary focus. And so we do have some impacts and as you pointed out we have a relatively higher expectation for net margins improvement that helps to mitigate that and is reflective to a degree of that and enables us to support the solid operating margin improvements that we're targeting next year. Erin Wright : Okay, great. And then more of a philosophical question here. So bear with me, but bigger picture, thinking about broader animal health and more specifically diagnostic trends and while there will be an element of normalization here near term, just given the tough comps and barring any sort of Omicron volatility, but it does seem that you suggest that we are emerging from the pandemic at a faster underlying growth rate for companion animal diagnostics that may be pre-pandemic, over the longer term. Does this change how you're thinking about your five year outlook? And how are you thinking about some of those changes over the course of the pandemic that may be actually more structural in nature? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yes, I'll take that. Good morning, Erin. There is a couple of quick longer term trends that the pandemic probably accelerated that were in effect and if anything, as a result of new pet adoptions and the pivot within practices, the more service versus retail type product sales, I think have just accelerated as a result of the pandemic. Clearly as veterinarians focus on medical services and patient care diagnostics is a big piece of that I think they recognize that diagnostics is obviously a very high margin, very high profit center within their practices. And so I think the combination of more patients, pet owners wanting a higher standards of patient care, veterinarians pivoting to services and the role that diagnostic plays, have been important factors. And then you layer on top of that, our strategy as a company which both includes continuing to innovate both in terms of testing platforms and information management and our commercial strategy, which is a high touch model and being able to work with veterinarians to help them use these tools effectively both business and medical wise, I think we continue to see very strong trends that are higher than pre-pandemic. Erin Wright : Okay, great, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Ryskin from BoA. Michael Ryskin : Great, thanks for taking the question. And congrats, Jay and Brian on the quarter and on solid guide. I want to ask about some of the new products and new initiatives you announced earlier this year at VMX or around VMX including the PetDx partnership slightly different than some of the things you've done in the past. And it does get to a point we've had questions from investors about in terms of additional testing modalities, additional opportunities beyond sort of what's already on the market. Could you talk about the oncology opportunity? Or if there's others beyond that that you're thinking of in terms of some of the untapped markets and diagnostics? How do you see this partnership playing out over next couple of years? And sort of -- of the things you highlighted earlier this year how meaningful is that a contributor to 2022 overall? Or is that more of a long term factor? Jay Mazelsky : Sure. Good morning, Mike. Pet cancer is the most prevalent cause of death in dogs. So there are about 6 billion positive cases of cancer of dogs just in the U.S., it's very significant. And if you take a look, that I just did a high level in terms of the process by which the veterinarian diagnosis and treats, it's very complex. It's fragmented and there aren't a complete set of diagnostic tools to help support that. So we think that there is a longer term very attractive market opportunity to be able to help veterinarians navigate cancer diagnosis and treatment. So we're building off our expertise in cancer pathology, which is really more today geared towards cancer identification and then really trying to get across the continuum of care which is the identification and staging and treating in monitoring and bring solutions to that full value chain of care. So the partnerships we announced, we think bring best in class technology to support that process. We're excited by it. It's still early stages in terms of market development. So I think it's less about the revenue opportunity near term and more about supporting veterinarians and helping them navigate what's very complex and what is increasingly pet owner driven demand for these types of services. I think over time it's a quite attractive opportunity. We bring, I think credible technical expertise to be able to support the veterinarian through this and we're excited by what we've learned and continuing to build off those capabilities over time. Michael Ryskin : Great, thanks. And then a follow up question on the guide again. The 12% to 14% recurrent revenue in CAG is very solid guide and relative to initial expectations, you touched on and you commented that you expect clinical visit growth in the market to be positive. And you stated price again, but could you talk about some of the other moving pieces there. Just trying to get at the bridge from that clinical visit growth to the CAG recurring revenues whether it's diagnostic frequency diagnostic utilization? Just sort of the CAG premium could help us bridge what are the moving pieces there? That'd be helpful. Brian McKeon : Yes, Mike. So I think the way to think about this as the as we were coming out of 2021 and clearly, we had a big step up in demand through the pandemic that we're confident that we can build off of that. So I think that's one key theme. And as you look at the calibrate this, the exit rate of our business in Q4 we had 13%, CAG DX recurring growth off that higher base. So we were entering the year with that kind of trajectory. And we see some positive drivers here. We're investing in international growth and feel good about the attraction and the potential there and we will have some incremental benefit from net pricing that we highlighted. And so the higher end of the range really reflects kind of building off of the momentum that we had I think to build on kind of Erin's question earlier, one of the metrics we share in our snapshot is just the average revenue per clinical visit in the inventor clinics in the U.S. and that increases Jay noted nearly 200 basis points from pre-pandemic levels from 4% to about 6%. So there's some underlying positive service trends here. And I think what you're seeing in our outlook is confidence that we can execute well, continue to execute well invest in ways that support that and if we can sustain that type of momentum we were, we think we can achieve those higher growth levels. And I think the lower end of the range really is more calibration going back towards more pre-pandemic type growth. It's not where we're necessarily projecting, but I think that that's a potential scenario as well. But all of this is building off of the higher demand. So it's some of this will come down to our execution. And I think things like Omicron or near term dynamics that we'll just need to manage through. As Jay mentioned, we don't see that as indicative of a longer term or an underlying demand issue. But the momentum on our business we feel very positive about and we're investing towards that. I think we've got a good strategy to keep building on that progress. Michael Ryskin : Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question is from Jon Block from Stifel. Jon Block : Hey, guys, great. Good morning. Thanks. First question is on wellness, clinical visits. They can continue to do very well. The two year average actually accelerated from the third quarter 21 levels. So just love management spots on staffing capacity issues at vet practices, we continue to hear a lot about those. I think others do as well. Jay and Brian how difficult are they because you would think wellness would be impacted. But again, an accelerated and maybe you believe the underlying industry demand from consumers is actually potentially higher from what we're seeing work its way through and then I've just got a follow up. Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. John, in terms of the wellness visits, and a couple of things that are potentially driving that. Obviously there's a lot of puppies and kittens who have now become dogs and cats. And I think there's a lot of pet owners who want to get their pets into the practice and being checked up and there's been an emphasis on wellness visits in the U.S. now for quite some time. So it's not new. Obviously there are some capacity constraints in some of these visits get pushed off a month or six weeks. And I think over time, that'll get relieved, but I think the under what we see as the underlying demand for wellness and checkups, is there and have been very robust as you pointed out, and we expect that to be able to sustain. Certainly we and others in the market place, I really focused and emphasizing preventive care, as they an important part of patient health. Jon Block : Okay, fair enough. And the second one, built on Chris's earlier question. So Brian, I'll try to maybe push you a little bit more. I think CAG DX recurring guide was, I think solid and a lot of people's view. It implies a two year average of in and around 15.5%. You helped I thought a lot on the cadence of OP margin expansion in 2022. You call that the comps with anything specifically to call out for CAG DX recurring to your average for 1Q? I mean, you got a wildly tough comp. You call that Omicron headwinds that persists. Jan, maybe even in February. Could this be a situation where we're looking at an organic revenue CAG DX of mid single digits when we take that all into account? Or maybe just phrase it, frame it versus that the two year average of 15.5 for full year? Thanks, guys. Brian McKeon : Look, the way I think we're thinking about this is we're building off this higher base. So we clearly had a period there where we needed to look at some two year metrics here to calibrate for 2020 effectively the pandemic dynamics. And now we're moving into sort of that phase of building off the higher base, I would say that there was some incremental benefit last year in Q4 from just the puppy boom and that I think is probably the key factor that sustains in the near term but for the most part we're normalizing off that hire base. And so I think that 12% to 14%, is that full year number one. We're not projecting by quarter, but I think we're that reflective of the overall momentum in the business. I think the Omicron dynamic is a near term dynamic in the U.S. that we didn't really see significantly in Q4. And then we're seeing some effects early here, what we'll sort that out as we go through the quarter, but I think the underlying momentum and trends we're targeting to remain strong and we'll work through these near term dynamics as they play out. Jon Block : All right, thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question is from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Brian, maybe starting with the OpEx guidance. I think you mentioned kind of the higher levels that you saw in the latter half of this year will continue into 2022. I guess it's kind of running in the back half of \u201821 was in the low 30% range in terms of revenue. Can you maybe talk about what you see the run rate being going forward both for 2022 and beyond because OpEx as a percent of revenue has come down a lot relative to historical levels? Do you see that getting back to historical levels are, you kind of feel like the current rate that we're adding is sort of what to expect as we go forward from here? Brian McKeon : So I think the way to think about Nathan is we had a Q4 growth rate year-on-year about 15% and we're working, still working through some compares to some relatively more controlled growth at OpEx levels in the comparable prior year. And so entering into Q1 we expect kind of the that same dynamic will have a relatively higher rate of OpEx that'll be our most challenging compare. And, in general terms, I think, for the full year, you should expect us to be trending back more in line with kind of our overall revenue growth where we want to lean in and invest towards future growth. I think our market dynamics will, as they've been in the past be supported by solid gross margin improvement. And so I think longer term consistent with our longer term outlooks that we've shared at Investor Day, I think OpEx grow closer to revenue growth is a reasonable expectation. Nathan Rich : Okay, that's helpful. And then, Brian, I don't know if you have any commentary on how we should expect kind of the weighting of earnings this year between like the first half and the second half, just kind of given the commentary on kind of the early first quarter trends as well as the higher OpEx levels. Is that going to kind of significantly change the typical seasonality that you usually see in the business? Brian McKeon : Yes. It's more driven by compares than necessarily a change in seasonality, but I did mention that our margin improvement would be in the second half. And as we just discussed, I think are more challenging compare will be in Q1 in terms of the quarters this year, but that's again more reflective of year-on-year dynamic. The one thing to highlight specifically is we'll still be working through an LPD. We have the decline in the African swine fever revenues that really started in the third quarter of 2021. We'll still be working through those compares. So that'll have a dynamic as well. Nathan Rich : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question is from Ryan Daniels from William Blair. Nicholas Spiekhout : Hey guys, Nick Spiekhout in for Ryan, most of my question has been asked. But I guess in the release you mentioned, you're still working your way through the ezyVet integration at least on the OpEx side. I was wondering how far along are you in that until you kind of, fully integrate, and you're no longer dealing with those expenses? Jay Mazelsky : Good morning. Yes the ezyVet integration has gone quite well, where we're far along in terms of really integrating our sales approach and organizations and product roadmaps. And that continues to received extremely well in the marketplace and the things from the growth numbers that there's a lot of traction behind that. It's a key part of our strategy and over 80% of our PIMs placements were cloud based placements this quarter. So really good traction far long in integration and going well. Nicholas Spiekhout : Great, thanks. And I guess, kind of just a quick follow up on the wellness visit color. With kind of that strong stack wellness growth, I was wondering if you guys are seeing any change in the proportion of those that have included a 10 panel like with a large growth are you seeing that kind of proportion come down are you kind of maintaining what the historical rate was with that growth? Brian McKeon : Yes, I mean, it's been pretty constant in terms of panel mix. It's something we don't break out. These are largely configured panels for wellness. So when customers use that get a lot of variation quarter-to-quarter. And so with that, I'd like to thank everybody for joining this morning's call. I know we have some employees who are listening. I would like to say thank you to them for their excellent performance and continued passion for our purpose. Day in and day out, our team delivered excellent results aligned to our long term opportunity while also demonstrating unwavering commitment to our purpose in navigating and evolving landscape through the continued pandemic impacts. Very grateful for the IDEXX team, and the purpose which drives our work. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

Participating in the call this morning are Jay Mazelsky, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian McKeon, Chief Financial Officer; and John Ravis, Vice President, Investor Relations.  IDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements. Listeners are reminded that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the forward-looking statements notice in our press release issued this morning as well as in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website, idexx.com.  During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website.  In reviewing our first quarter 2022 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2021, unless otherwise noted. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today, I'll take you through our first quarter results and review our recalibrated financial outlook for 2022.  IDEXX delivered solid financial performance in Q1 compared to very strong prior year results. In terms of highlights, revenue increased 8% as reported and organically driven by organic gains of 10% in our CAG business and 8% in our water business. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 9% organically compared to higher prior year levels, which included benefits from a significant expansion in new pet patients during the pandemic.  Our commercial execution was excellent, reflected in 22% organic growth in CAG instrument revenues and continued strong momentum in expanding cloud-based software solutions. EPS was $2.27 per share, up 3% on a comparable basis. As expected, comparisons to high prior year gross margin levels and increased commercial investments constrained year-on-year operating profit gains in the quarter.  CAG Diagnostic demand levels and IDEXX commercial execution continue to build on the significant step-up achieved during the pandemic, supported by ongoing gains in diagnostics adoption and utilization. We have seen a moderation in clinic visit levels compared to second half 2021 growth trends, which form the basis for our original 2022 CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue organic growth outlook of 12% to 14%. In the U.S., in addition to early Q1 impacts from higher COVID cases globally, visit levels have been affected by constraints on veterinary service capacity and availability in a challenging labor market, following a period of significant demand expansion.  We saw similar COVID and capacity constraint dynamics in international regions like Europe with additional recent impacts for more challenging macro conditions, which have also constrained clinical visit growth compared to strong prior year baselines. Factoring in our Q1 results and near-term CAG sector trends, we're recalibrating our 2022 full year organic revenue growth outlook. We're adjusting our overall organic growth outlook to 7.5% to 10%, primarily reflecting an adjustment of 3% in our targeted full year CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth range, now projected at 9% to 11% compared to strong prior year levels. We're also factoring in an additional $40 million impact from the strength in U.S. dollar. Combined, these changes reduced our reported growth outlook by 3.5% or approximately $105 million at the midpoint of our guidance range. We believe these adjustments are appropriate as we work through near-term CAG sector dynamics and more challenging comparisons in the first half of 2022. We're targeting higher growth in the second half of 2022, with the high end of our full year growth outlook reflecting return to our original targeted CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth range in H2. We continue to be encouraged by the increased demand for Companion Animal diagnostics globally building on the strong gains achieved during the pandemic. We're confident in the sustained long-term growth potential for our business, supported by our ongoing focus on innovation and customer engagement and driving CAG sector development. Aligning with this conviction, we're advancing high-return investments in innovation and commercial capability this year, including approximately $80 million in discrete investments related to the in-license of technology during the second quarter, which Jay will discuss in his remarks.  Our 2022 EPS guidance of $8.11 to $8.35 per share factors and updates to our operating outlook, including $0.72 of discrete impact from the in-license of technology, as well as a $0.10 per share adjustment related to the stronger U.S. dollar and $0.05 of EPS impact related to higher interest rates. We'll discuss our full year outlook in more detail later in my comments.  Let's begin with a review of our first quarter results. First quarter organic revenue growth of 8% was supported by 10% organic gains in our CAG business and 8% growth in our Water business. These gains were moderated as expected by a 19% organic decline in LPD revenues, which included impacts from reduced African swine fever testing in China, as well as by a $3 million year-on-year decline in human COVID testing revenues. Combined, these factors reduced overall IDEXX organic revenue growth by approximately 1% in the first quarter. Comparisons on both these fronts will improve in the second half of 2022.  CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 9% organically in Q1 compared to strong prior year levels, reflecting 10% gains in the U.S. and 8% growth in international regions. First quarter CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth benefited by approximately 1% from equivalent day effects. Overall Q1 CAG gains were also supported by 22% organic growth in CAG instrument revenues and 13% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues, in addition to benefits from the ezyVet acquisition. In terms of U.S. CAG sector demand drivers, same-store clinical visits in the first quarter were approximately 2% below strong prior year levels. This compares to 2% to 3% increases seen in the second half of 2021 when we began to lap the step-up in demand -- in testing demand that we saw during the pandemic. As noted, a factor influencing these trends is a near-term challenge related to capacity management of vet clinics that we've seen across global regions, which has resulted in constraints on clinic hours and access to veterinarians. Jay will speak more to these dynamics in his comments. At the U.S. practice level, same-store diagnostic service revenue growth was a solid 7%. Underlying demand for pet health care services remains high, reflecting a robust multiyear growth trends. Compared to the 2019 pre-pandemic base, U.S. same-store clinical visits and diagnostic revenues increased 4% and 11%, respectively, on a 3-year compound annual growth basis. IDEXX's U.S. CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth of 10% in Q1 continues to outpace sector growth trends, reflected in a 1,150 basis point premium to clinical visit gains, in part supported by relatively higher net price realization and equivalent day benefits. Globally, IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue gains across our modalities in the first quarter. VetLab consumable revenues increased 11% organically with double-digit gains across U.S. and international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 14% year-on-year growth in our global premium installed base, reflecting double-digit gains across our Catalyst, premium hematology and SediVue platforms. CAG premium instrument placements increased 31% in Q1, reflecting 24% gains in the U.S. and 35% growth internationally, as clinics show confidence in investing towards support of increasing demand for diagnostics globally.  The quality of instrument placements continues to be very strong, reflected in 12% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements. ProCyte One momentum continues to build, supporting 1,924 premium hematology placements in the quarter, up 101%. Rapid Assay revenues expanded solidly in Q1 compared to high prior year growth levels. Global Rapid Assay revenues increased 8% organically, supported by solid volume gains in the U.S. and benefits from net price increases. Global lab revenues increased 8% organically in Q1 as double-digit growth in the U.S. was moderated by low single-digit gains in international regions impacted by pressure on clinical visit levels in Europe. Reference lab new business momentum and customer retention remains strong globally, supported by expansion of IDEXX 360 agreements. We achieved relatively higher benefits from net price gains in the first quarter, with 4% to 5% average gains on U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and solid levels of increases across international regions. In other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 13% organically and 34% on a reported basis, including benefits from the ezyVet acquisition. Results were supported by double-digit organic gains in recurring software and digital imaging revenues and continued strong momentum in cloud-based software placements. Water revenues increased 8% organically in Q1, reflecting benefits from price gains and a continued solid global recovery in testing demand from constrained pandemic levels. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenue decreased 19% organically in Q1. As expected, tough comparisons to high prior year revenue levels for African swine fever and core swine testing in China, offset moderate overall organic revenue gains in other areas of our LPD business. We expect to see relative improvement in LPD growth rates in the second half of the year as we work through challenging comparisons in the Asia Pacific region.  Turning to the P&L. Solid revenue growth supported moderate operating profit and comparable EPS gains compared to high prior year levels. Gross profit increased 6% in Q1 as reported and 7% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 59.6%, a decrease of 120 basis points on a comparable basis. Comparable gross margin declines reflect the lapping of high Q1 2021 levels, business mix impacts from lower LPD and higher CAG instrument revenues and impacts from higher freight and distribution costs. CAG recurring revenue, net price gains and lab productivity initiatives helped to offset select inflationary impacts. We're also seeing benefits from improvement in software service gross margins as we expand our recurring revenue base. Operating expenses increased 12% year-on-year as reported in the first quarter and 13% on a comparable basis. Higher operating expense growth reflects comparisons to controlled prior year levels, as well as investments advanced in recent quarters related to our expanded global commercial capability. We also saw relatively higher travel costs compared to low prior year levels. We expect relatively higher year-on-year comparable OpEx growth in the second quarter as we lap these impacts, in addition to the second quarter impacts projected from discrete R&D in-license activity. EPS was $2.27 per share, an increase of 3% on a comparable basis. Q1 EPS included benefits of $5 million or $0.06 per share related to share-based compensation benefits, which was down $0.11 per share from high prior year group levels. Foreign exchange reduced operating profit by $4 million and EPS by $0.03 per share in Q1, net of $2 million in hedge gains. Free cash flow was $83 million in the first quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 84%. For the full year, we now estimate free cash flow conversion of 65% to 70%, approximately 10% below earlier conversion estimates. This outlook reflects approximately 5% of free cash flow conversion impact from the discrete R&D investments, modestly higher inventory levels to sustain high levels of product availability and higher deferred tax assets driven by increased R&D credits. We're maintaining a consistent full year outlook for capital spending of $180 million, including approximately $50 million for our new manufacturing and warehouse expansion project.  Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.1x gross and 0.9x net of cash. We allocated $273 million of capital to repurchase 523,000 shares in Q1. Our financial outlook assumes capital allocation to share repurchases aligned with maintaining a similar net leverage ratio, supporting a projected 1.5% full year reduction in share count.  Turning to our 2022 full year outlook. We're updating our organic revenue growth ranges to reflect Q1 performance, recent CAG sector trends and projected impacts related to the Ukraine War. We're also adjusting our reported revenue growth outlook for the significant recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our updated full year revenue growth range of $3.39 billion to $3.465 billion reflects a $105 million reduction at midpoint compared to earlier estimates. This includes $10 million of projected revenue reductions related to our Russia, Belarus and Ukraine businesses, and a $40 million adjustment related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We now project foreign exchange will reduce year-on-year revenue growth by approximately 3% for the full year, with approximately 4% of year-on-year headwinds expected in Q2. Our full year organic revenue outlook of 7.5% to 10% reflects an adjustment to our original guidance range of 2% to 2.5%, primarily reflecting a recalibration of our full year growth outlook for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. We're planning for overall organic growth at the lower end of this range in the first half of 2022, reflecting more recent CAG sector trends and challenging comparisons in the second quarter. We're targeting improved growth rates in the second half of 2022 as vet clinics work to adapt to capacity challenges, and we benefit from our commercial initiatives.  Our recalibrated CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook is 9% to 11% for the full year, building on strong prior year gains. As noted, the high end of our full year growth range reflects second half CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth aligned with our original full year goals. At our updated revenue growth rates, we're now planning for operating margins of 26.8% to 27.3%, down 170 to 220 basis points on a reported basis compared to strong 2021 performance. This includes approximately 230 basis points of margin impact related to the discrete R&D investments. This outlook incorporates effects from high-return commercial investments aligned with our long-term growth potential and captures projected inflationary effects on IDEXX's business this year.  Adjusted for the discrete R&D investments and approximately 10 basis points in year-on-year net margin benefit from foreign exchange hedges, this outlook reflects updated goals for 0 to 50 basis points in operating margin gains in 2022 compared to strong prior year levels. Our EPS outlook is $8.11 to $8.35 per share, a decrease of $1.20 at midpoint. This includes $0.72 of impact from discrete R&D investments, an additional $0.10 per share headwind related to foreign exchange and $0.05 per share of impact from higher projected interest rates. Our guidance for comparable EPS growth of minus 1% to plus 2% includes unfavorable growth impacts of 9% from the discrete R&D investments, and an estimated 2% impact in 2022 from international tax rate changes.  We provided details on our updated estimates in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Jonathan Mazelsky : Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX had a solid start to 2022, building on significant gains in demand for companion animal diagnostics and software solutions achieved over the last 2 years. Veterinarians continue to see increased demand in their clinics compared to pre-pandemic turns and routinely choose IDEXX' innovative products and services to meet rising standards for pet health care. This is reflected in our continued solid CAG Diagnostics recurring growth and record Q1 global premium instrument placements, supported by our global rollout of ProCyte One. IDEXX' business strategy is focused on inspiring adoption and increasing the utilization of diagnostics, and our results reflect continued strong progress on this path. Our integrated solutions not only help veterinarians expand capacity and grow their businesses, but also support an enduring recurring revenue stream in the future. While we've seen some moderation in CAG sector growth metrics from very strong growth levels during the pandemic, we have high confidence in the durability and ongoing growth potential of our business, and our strategy to drive the significant long-term growth opportunity we see for companion animal health care. Today, I'll focus on discussing IDEXX's performance and progress in advancing key growth initiatives that are enabling us to build on our strong growth and financial performance as we serve our mission-driven purpose of enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock.  Let me start by providing some context on recent trends in the CAG sector. Overall, CAG sector demand trends continued to expand at a solid rate, building on the very strong increases in diagnostics demand seen through the pandemic. As Brian noted, U.S. practice same-store diagnostics revenues increased 7% in the first quarter compared to very strong prior year results. IDEXX's growth strategy has been consistently focused on driving diagnostics adoption and utilization at the clinic level, supported by our investments in commercial engagement and innovation. First quarter results show continued progress on this front.  We've provided some additional information in our quarterly snapshot, which breaks down practice level diagnostics revenue growth dynamics into 3 key drivers : clinical visit growth; diagnostic frequency, or the percentage of clinical visits, including diagnostics; and diagnostics utilization, or diagnostics revenue per visit that include diagnostics. This breakdown highlights benefits for both continued solid increases in diagnostics frequency and expanded growth rates in diagnostics utilization ahead of pre-pandemic levels, building on a very strong gain seen over the last 2 years.  These impressive gains were moderated in Q1 by a 2% year-on-year decline in clinical visits, which is a change from the very solid 2% to 3% clinical visit growth trends we saw in the second half of 2021. As we've analyzed these recent changes, it appears that in addition to some effects from COVID case spikes and weather dynamics in the first quarter, there are near-term constraints on vet clinic capacity that are impacting clinical visit levels.  Veterinarians and their staffs are continuing to adapt to the extraordinary growth in demand over the last 2 years when the U.S. pet population expanded, approximately 10%, resulting in double-digit increases in same-store clinical visit levels, reflective of the sustained pressure on their time as well as staffing challenges that many sectors are facing currently. Pet clinics have scaled back hours. The metric we can track is the percentage of clinics with weekend appointment activity, which declined to 42% in Q1 from 54% levels pre-pandemic, as clinics and vet themselves are looking to achieve more near-term balance in their workloads.  As many pet owners wait longer to secure appointments, underlying demand for pet health care remains strong. But these factors have had the near-term effect of moderating the extraordinary growth pace we've seen in the CAG industry over the last 2 years. We've seen similar dynamics in international regions like Europe in terms of clinical visit levels, with some additional pressures potentially related to the more recent macro headwinds. Given the near-term clinical visit and macro dynamics noted, we felt it was prudent to recalibrate our 2022 outlook. Our full year outlook for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue organic growth of 9% to 11% builds on our 17% average annual growth over the last 2 years, with goals to accelerate gains in the second half of 2022 benefiting from continued advancement of our commercial and innovation efforts.  The longer-term outlook for pet health care remains very strong, benefiting from increases in pet ownership, favorable demographic trends and the continued strengthening of the pet and pet owner bond. IDEXX is well positioned to drive sector growth and help customers service growing demand through our broad array of point-of-care and reference laboratory products and services, all connected by cloud-based software capability, which supports clinic efficiency and workflow enhancements.  The IDEXX team is focused on driving this potential and continues to operate at an exceptional level. This is reflected in continued solid new business gains, record instrument placement levels, high growth in software services and the continued very high levels of customer satisfaction reflected in record high retention models. Our high-touch customer commercial model and innovative diagnostics and software solutions positions us well to help customers work through near-term management challenges to extend the strong growth momentum in our business. Let's discuss some recent progress on these key strategic fronts.  High levels of commercial engagement that supports sector growth remains a pillar of our growth strategy, and we continue to build on our leading commercial capability globally. As noted, we continue to drive strong performance in terms of new business acquisition, with solid net customer gains across modalities and regions. Our highly skilled commercial teams delivered outstanding premium instrument placement performance in Q1 across our platforms, supporting strong growth in our EVI metric in the quarter. We achieved strong growth overall across new, competitive and loyal customer segments as well as within corporate accounts, as veterinarians are clearly looking to use IDEXX technology to manage elevated demand within their clinics. And despite highly variable access levels globally, our sales teams demonstrate that they have strong and trusting relationships with their customers, regardless of clinic type and a keen ability to meet customer needs with IDEXX products, each of which are driving strong customer retention and healthy global installed base growth.  This momentum has been supported by the strengthening of our commercial capabilities in international regions. We're encouraged by the early performance measures like reach to customer and reach to revenue from our recently completed international country expansions. These include Germany, France, Spain, South Korea, Italy and Brazil, while it had smaller targeted investments in our commercial capabilities to complement these efforts as opportunity warrants, including in our largest region in the U.S. Commercial expansions are supported through our center of excellence approach, which enables efficiency, speed of execution and high return on our investments.  Innovation is a critical enabler of our growth strategy. And key advancements such as ProCyte One, IDEXX's innovative and easy-to-use hematology analyzer, continues to gain momentum and provide multiplier benefits for our business. Just 1 year after its launch, ProCyte One is now commercially available around the world and has a global installed base of almost 4,000 units, demonstrating the power of the right product in the hands of a dedicated commercial sales force. This trajectory aligns our premium hematology business with the approximately 20,000 placement outlook we shared at our most recent Investor Day, and utilization rates are trending favorably for customers upgrading from [indiscernible] side. ProCyte One attach rates with Catalysts are high in the mid-90% range, highlighting the multiplier benefit to our broader point-of-care business. This innovative hematology platform is a key enabler to support penetration of our estimated 200,000 worldwide premium instrument placement opportunity.  Another key advancement in our innovation agenda is 4Dx Plus, the gold standard diagnostic for vector-borne disease in canines, which will provide customers with benefits from multiple product enhancements this year, including the more sensitive end-of-plasma detection, clinical decision support and USDA approval for 2x longer room temperature storage for our point-of-care test SNAP 4Dx Plus. It's an example of IDEXX's whole product approach of enhancing assay performance, workflow and clinical decision support. Additionally, the SNAP Pro analyzer, which has had excellent momentum in global placements during Q1, improves clinic workflows by seamlessly adding test results through our powerful diagnostics portal VetConnect PLUS, and ensuring charge capture of all tests run through of the instrument. These innovative products help our customers improve clinic efficiency and supported solid growth in our rapid assay franchise in the first quarter as we saw seasonally aligned increases in demand for tick-borne disease testing.  As we capture near-term benefits from our existing innovations with customers, we continue to advance our long-term innovation agenda as well. As noted in our financial guidance update, we made investments with 2 companies, the in-licensed technology for worldwide exclusive use in developing point-of-care diagnostics platforms and applications. IDEXX has a long track record of partnering with companies to apply technology that enhances the quality of pet health care. We look forward to sharing more on these initiatives in the future as we build on our compelling real-time care portfolio.  Another key area of strategic focus for IDEXX involves delivering whole product software solutions that address a broad jobs-to-do capability within a single platform. Our PIMS solutions, along with Vet Radar and payment processing solutions, VetConnect PLUS, with clinical decision support and Web PACS, are all increasingly interconnected, offering our customers a seamless experience across the inland productivity applications. Consequently, our customers purchased more of these applications in Q1 than in any previous quarter. We also had record global placements with over 350 PIMS installations, with the vast majority of customers choosing a cloud-based solution. Notably, we made significant headway in outfitting greenfield practices that the IDEXX is a key partner as they establish and equip a new clinic.  With many customers capacity constrained, veterinarians have a significant investment appetite for modern, mobile and well-integrated cloud-based software technology. These software solutions allow our customers to focus on providing care instead of maintaining technology. With our recent acquisition of ezyVet and as preference for cloud-based solutions accelerate, our software revenue base continues to move towards a highly profitable recurring revenue stream.  As we advance our commercial and innovation capabilities, we are highly committed to sustaining outstanding levels of customer support, reference lab service turnaround time and product availability enabled by our highly capable operations organization. The manufacturing and supply chain capabilities that we built over multiple decades allow us to support our busy customers and keep up with the strong growth in industry demand, while managing through a dynamic supply chain environment. IDEXX customers benefited once again from product availability close to 100% and continuously high levels of on-time deliveries. These excellent service metrics demonstrate the benefit of our long product life cycles and deep supplier relationships, as well as our investment in highly skilled manufacturing centers. And while we continue to monitor the impacts of inflationary dynamics in regional COVID-19 outbreaks, we feel confident in our ability to build upon strong financial performance, as Brian outlined in our full year financial outlook.  In concluding our first quarter review, I'd like to welcome Michael Johnson to IDEXX as our new Chief Human Resources Officer. Michael brings over 22 years of experience in developing HR leadership capabilities across multiple disciplines and geographies, most recently at Abbott Laboratories, where he was Divisional Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion. The Chief Human Resources Officer role is a key enabler of our long-term growth strategy in supporting employee engagement, talent development and organizational effectiveness, and we look forward to Michael's leadership and continually advancing our initiatives and performance in these areas. Welcome, Michael.  This concludes our review of our first quarter performance. Before opening the line for Q&A, I want to extend our deepest sympathies to the people of Ukraine as the escalating war has taken a devastating toll on people and pets in the region. As a purpose-driven company, we strongly condemn the invasion and violence there. We have been focused on supporting our customers, the health and safety of our employees in the region and true to the heart of IDEXX, the pets that are part of their families. We have significantly scaled back operations in Russia, including suspending sales of veterinary diagnostic equipment in the country. Instead, our focus has been on supporting the essential care of pets to the extent that we can through our existing veterinary customers.  To support the humanitarian needs of the region, we have leveraged the IDEXX Foundation to provide funding to the International Medical Court, the World Central Kitchen and the International Fund for Animal Welfare, while also providing free rabies tests for displaced Ukrainian pets all over Europe. Going forward, we will monitor the situation to identify the additional ways to support Ukrainian refugees and their pets. I would like to thank our employees around the world who have taken part in the IDEXX Foundation Matching program to make personal donations to these organizations.  With that, we will turn to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : On this issue of vet constraints, it seems like we've been hearing about this issue for much of the pandemic. So I'm just trying to get a better understanding of kind of what's changed in 2022 where this is now starting to kind of back up into your revenue guidance, its starting to hit numbers a bit more. So I'm just trying to understand, just finally hit a breaking point where the vets just can't sustain what they've been doing?  And maybe as a second part of that same question, what do you think it will take to start to see visit growth normalize? Do we need to just take a little bit of a pause here for some of these vets who need to hire people? I'm just trying to get a sense of just what's the path forward to see growth start to normalize.  And then maybe just slip in one other one and some of the same kind of topic. Is the slowdown you're seeing here completely that capacity related? So if there were more slots for visits that there'd be demand for that? Or is there also some elements of lower demand reflected in the guidance today? Brian McKeon : Thanks for your question, Chris. Maybe I can set some context and Jay can provide more color. On the clinical visit trends, which we've highlighted really were the main change that's going on here that would cause us to kind of recalibrate our outlook this year, we started lapping the step-up in demand in the pandemic in the second half of 2021. And that was flowing through the benefits of the pet additions and the big increases in services and diagnostics that we saw through the pandemic. And the clinical visit levels were up solidly in H2. So they were growing 2% to 3% off that higher base. And so this is a relatively more recent dynamic. I think Jay can go into this more in color, but it's clearly a significant factor here is the vet capacity. I think that there is a trying to adapt following, a significant expansion of the demand in the industry and just dealing with some of the labor dynamics that many sectors are dealing with in the near term. And we're still working through these tough year-on-year compares. I think that will continue through the first half of this year in terms of the step-up. So that is the primary factor.  Other dynamics that are going on here are all incredibly positive. I think our -- at the clinic level, diagnostic frequency and utilization is up. The service, focus on services, service -- same-store service revenues are still growing. Sales are great. Instruments are very strong, software placements, customer retention, record levels. So this is primarily this dynamic, which we think is largely related to the capacity constraint. And that will normalize, I think, as we work through some of these compares and as clinics adapt to this long-term growth in demand that we think will sustain. Jonathan Mazelsky : Yes. Chris, let me try to address your question from a context standpoint, both from the standpoint of capacity or supply, and then I want to talk a bit about the pet owner dynamics and demand. So all the surveys and all the conversations we've had with veterinarians indicate a good deal of optimism about the future and it includes 2022 in terms of growth and their prospects. Their focus is really, I think, pivoted. The pandemic has only accelerated the pivot towards being able to provide excellent medical services and patient care, as well as a pleasing client experience. So relatively less emphasis on things like product sales, specialty diets.  They're also seeing, from a pet owner standpoint, demanding clients who really want full-service care. So speaking with a number of veterinarians just yesterday, they remarked when pet owners come in are still looking to really have sort of an end-to-end approach to care. So I talked about that strong pivot. And if anything, the pandemic, I think, has only accelerated that. And they know that the diagnostics plays a key role in being able to guide care services and the whole clinical envelope.  And to Brian's point, at the same time, there's been a very significant step-up in activity, both in terms of number of patients. There's 10-plus percent more pets relative to pre-pandemic, 10-plus percent higher clinical visits. And the practices themselves, they haven't been immune to some of the labor and staff challenges that, to some extent, all businesses are facing. So they're working through that dynamic of higher activity, while trying to create some balance and looking to increase capacity.  And they're looking at us in many respects, and have this large appetite for things like IDEXX instrumentation. We saw that manifest itself in higher sales, cloud-based software solutions. I think it's both indicative of their optimism for the future, and recognizing that if they have better tools that can support both staff productivity and higher standards of care.  Let me pivot and talk a bit about pet owner dynamics, because I think that addresses your question how this is going to play out over time. By all accounts, we think pet owner demand remains very strong. We all know there's a very strong human-animal bond. And by all accounts, all the data we look at, that continues to grow. We also know that, from a spending power standpoint, just as a percent of discretionary spend that they're spending all in on pets across all economic and demographic cohorts, still under 2%. And the medical services piece, much smaller than that.  So pet owners, they consistently indicate not just in surveys, but in actual behavior that they prioritize spend on veterinary care, sometimes even to the extent that about a quarter or so, that they would spend first on their pet before their own health care. But they prioritize consistently across much larger groups relative to things like entertainment and travel and going out to dinner. And that's even more pronounced in the younger generations like Generation Z and Millennials. So getting back to -- we know there's been a significant number of adoptions to the pandemic, 10-plus percent over the last couple of years. We look at things like surrenders and we don't see any real movement from that baseline. In fact, what the survey say is that first-time pet owners are looking to actually adopt potentially a second pet in some appreciable numbers. From a headwind standpoint, we know there's some overlays, like working from home and companies returning more to a, sort of, a hybrid-type model. But we think that, that still gives the pet owners the flexibility to be able to take their dog or cat to the veterinarian. So we're keeping an eye on these trends. But I think, on a net basis, we think pet-owner demand remains strong. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our next question is from Michael Ryskin from Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : Jay, Brian, I want to follow up on some of the points that you just touched on sort of the vet demands and what you're seeing in the channel. Just to put it bluntly, you've got -- if you look at the comps, first half last year, second half last year, obviously, the second half comps on that visit growth gets a lot easier. But if you look at it on a 2-year or 3-year basis, it's actually a little bit more normalized. So we can start getting into the math of you doing a 2-year compare, 3-year compare.  But putting all that aside, what is your expectation for vet visit growth over the course of the year? I mean we're at negative 1.5 in the first quarter. There were some Omicron issues in January, but it seems like it didn't dramatically improve over the rest of the quarter. So what's your expectation for vet business growth in 2Q and then over the course of the entire year? And I've got a follow-up. Brian McKeon : Yes, Mike. So on your first question, we're trying to look at these multiyear dynamics too. I think that's largely right. The one thing I'd point out is that the step-up in the new patients that occurred through the pandemic, there was an incremental aspect to the growth that I think benefited, we think, second half of 2021 into the first half of 2022. So there's a bit of a growth dynamic that's additive to making the first half a little more challenging. But I think on balance, we agree that the multiyear trends look quite good, and that informs some of our optimism.  And in terms of how we're thinking about the year, if you look at the range that we provided, effectively, the higher end of the range assumes that we move back towards a healthy positive growth rate on the clinical visit trends. It's the -- as we noted, the CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth for the second half at the higher end reflects our original goals. And so that was what we were seeing coming into the year. And the lower end is more in line with what we're -- we've seen in Q1. So there's some level of pressure year-on-year continues. So we're not explicitly guiding on that metric. But those, I think logically, that's how the full year guidance ends together. Jonathan Mazelsky : Yes. And I would just add to that, though, clinical visits, it's been an important part of our growth algorithm, but it's just one part. The other thing to keep in mind is the diagnostics adoption and the utilization piece of the business is very strong. We've highlighted that in the earnings highlight where adoption and utilization is at or higher than what we've seen from the pre-pandemic level. So from a customer engagement standpoint, I think we have a pretty well-defined playbook. It's really been honed and optimized over the years to be able to drive and inspire diagnostics adoption and utilization, both through creating awareness and education and ultimately, trialing. But also innovation and continuing to bring innovation that solves the challenging practice and patient problems. So we're optimistic about our ability to continue to do that and do that in an effective way. Michael Ryskin : Okay. And if I could squeeze in a bigger picture one, hopefully it should be quick. At the Analyst Day last year in August, you guys talked about same strong trends, the same sort of secular drivers. And you pointed to your view of the long-term diagnostic sector growth should be a full percentage point higher than prior because of the higher number of pets, because of the adoption, because of higher sort of diagnostics utilization.  But if we sort of flash forward 6 months or 8 months to where we are now, obviously, we're seeing some near-term constraints. So I just wanted to, longer term, are you still sticking with that diagnostics growth of 1% above historical on a multiyear basis? Brian McKeon : Yes. Just to revisit, we had a range on the multiyear CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth, and we raised the lower end of the range, I think, reflecting our confidence into the range is 11% to 14%. And really what underlies that range, and this underlies our business strategy is our effectiveness as a growing utilization of diagnostics with their customers over time. And the pre-pandemic improvement levels, as you're aware, Mike, we focused in on this, the percentage of -- the percentage of business that use blood work in diagnostics, and we had been seeing roughly a 50 basis point annual improvement in that metric over time, and that was the pre-pandemic trend. And we saw that accelerate in the pandemic to more like 100 basis points.  So as Jay highlighted, we're continuing to see very nice improvement on diagnostic utilization. So we're very confident in that part of the strategy. That is the part of the strategy that we influence heavily with our innovation and our customer engagement, and we're very confident in our ability on that front. And so nothing's changed in terms of those dimensions.  I think we are working through a period here where we had a big step-up in ownership in pets and demand and through the pandemic, and we're transitioned to growing off this higher base. And we're working through some compares here, but the long-term view of the optimism we have for the business in the long term hasn't changed. Operator : And our next question is from Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley. Erin Wright : Great. I'm surprised a little that the vet capacity constraints are such a surprise to you relative to your prior expectations. But you did mention, Brian, at the beginning of your prepared remarks, a macro dynamic as well. And I was just wondering if that comment was in relation to the labor constraints or actually changes in consumer dynamics as well.  And we've obviously seen -- and this goes into a bigger picture question of we've seen your business grow in a challenging economy kind of in the past. And can you remind us the sensitivity of your business to a tougher economic backdrop and what levers you have to grow in even a challenging clinic visit backdrop as well? Brian McKeon : Yes. Just on -- let me reflect on the comment I made and then Jay can talk more about the resilience of the business. It was specifically related more to Europe. We saw relatively more softness in Europe than we anticipated. And so we're just signaling that it may be related to some of the impacts indirectly from the Ukraine war and higher energy prices and things of that nature. So we -- that it's harder for us to parse that, but it was -- that was what the comment related to. Jonathan Mazelsky : Yes. Erin, just in terms of the resilience of the business. If you go back to the Great Recession and the recovery in 2008, 2009, our revenue grew 5%. Now a lot has changed over that 10-plus years, and I think from a very positive standpoint.  We worked through other channels, third-party distributor channels. We now have our own direct channel and direct relationships with customers. We know that the human animal bond and the strengthening of the bond has suddenly increased and increased very appreciably. Obviously, there's a lot more pets. And our innovation portfolio, both across the reference labs and our point-of-care diagnostics portfolio, and very importantly, in this environment, software has gotten, I think, appreciably stronger and more capable, not just in the U.S. but globally. So we think we're a very resilient business that has become even more resilient as a result of those factors. Erin Wright : Okay, great. And then in terms of pricing, where is net price realization shaking out now for the year in terms of what's embedded in the guidance and relative to what you disclosed last quarter? And are there further price increases embedded for the remainder of the year? Brian McKeon : As I mentioned in our comments our U.S., on average over the overall CAG Diagnostic recurring base was in the 4% to 5% range, so it's a bit better than we had indicated originally, and we've got solid improvements in other markets as well. So I think we feel good about our pricing plans, and that's something we will continue to look at over time.  And I also note that I think vet clinics are showing an ability to pass on pricing as well, and that's reflected in their growth numbers. Operator : Our next question is from Jon Block from Stifel. Jonathan Block : Maybe just to start, we also picked up capacity constraints in our checks recently for this quarter. But we actually also had a similar amount, roughly a similar amount of vets start to talk about the demand equation.  And so a pretty direct question here. But for the revised guidance, Jay or Brian, what are your thoughts there? What are you embedding? Is the new guidance all about the capacity constraints, you give those weekend metrics? Or did you also embed some wiggle room or earmark some stuff for the consumer? And what might be occurring or what might still need to play out, call it, into the back part of the year? Brian McKeon : So we haven't explicitly projected changes in the macro environment in our outlook. What I would say is that we are capturing more recent dynamics, including some of the dynamics that have been going on in regions like Europe, which as we indicated, may have some macro impacts. And they signal, we're anticipating that the growth in the second quarter will be at the lower end of our full year organic growth range of 7.5% to 10%. So I think we are -- we're trying to capture what we believe includes the capacity dynamics, but what macro impacts may be going on into our outlook, and that's also reflected in the full year range that I shared earlier.  So I think it's not something, again, we forecast specifically, Jon, but I think as Jay pointed out, this has been a business that's always been resilient. If anything, over time, the factors that are supporting our demand, whether it be strengthening of the pet owner bond or just improvements in our own capacity as a company to influence growth and support the industry have only grown. So we think that reinforces we'll have -- we'll be relatively well positioned to changes. And we think we're capturing kind of the more recent trends appropriately in the guidance range that we've shared. Jonathan Block : Got it. Okay, fair enough. And then maybe just a follow-up. And I think you sort of hit on this here and there, but let me try to drill down on a little bit or get an answer. The CAG Dx frequency, you guys give a ton of helpful information. But the CAG Dx frequency or the percent of clinical visits, including diagnostics, that was roughly -- it looks like a 0.5% contributor to revenue growth per practice, call it, pre-COVID. Then it went to 3% in 1Q '21, and then it looks like back to 0.5% in 1Q '22.  Why that move? Why that step down? And then maybe some color, is that a reflection of curb side stepping down as we're normalized and there's no longer the drop-off of the pet and maybe less friction on what the veterinarian wants to test for. Is that why we're seeing that return to normalization? Is that the anticipation going forward? Jonathan Mazelsky : Yes. Jon, it's Jay. So keep in mind, that's from -- that 0.5%, which is more of the pre-pandemic historical norm is from a much higher base. So we're building off that 3% base that we saw in Q1 of 2021. And so we both look at -- to the extent that clinical visits include diagnostics, we want to be able to continue to grow that, and we have seen nice growth in this year of that higher base, as well as then when they do use it, are they using more from a volume and dollar standpoint. And that's 8%, which includes some price effect there. So we think that is very healthy in terms of how veterinarians see the use of diagnostics as an enabler to the broader medical services envelope. Brian McKeon : And we're hearing anecdotally that pet owners are more invested and interested in what's going on. So as testing is done, they're interested in expanding the scope of services for those owners that are bringing their pets in. So I think the metrics that we're showing here, building off the higher base are reinforcing them. Jonathan Mazelsky : Yes. Just specifically around your comment relative to curb side, drop off and pick up. We see practices even though we've, I think, transitioned from the pandemic to the endemic business, continue that in -- I mean it's in the minority of cases probably 15-plus -- they like that from the standpoint of supporting the productivity of the practice, a lot of pet owners like that.  I think practices have adopted some level of concierge service around that type of thing. So I don't think that, that's going to go away. It will probably continue to remain a smaller part of that whole. Certainly, it's a step down from sort of the peak of the pandemic, but it's still there to some extent. Operator : And our next question is from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : Maybe the first one on just the margin outlook. Brian, I think if I'm moving -- or looking at the moving pieces correctly, it seems like the core kind of constant currency margin is maybe down 30 basis points relative to what you initially expected. I mean, is that just a function of the lower CAG Dx growth expectation and the deleverage there?  And I guess, kind of as we think into next year and what might come back, I mean if you see a return to normalized CAG Dx growth in '23, do you see -- do you get back any of that, the lower margin, I guess, that you might realize this year, does that come back next year? And then I just wanted to clarify, do we sort of get the -- or do we lap the kind of R&D expense in 2023 and so you kind of get that impact back next year? Brian McKeon : Right. On the last point, yes, we view that as a discrete investment that will not occur in 2023. We're not projecting that. So that will be a favorable year-on-year, and we try to provide that specific impact, so you can calibrate for that.  I think your interpretation is right, Nate, that the -- we originally had an outlook this year, clearing away currency and the discrete R&D impact of a 50 to 100 basis point improvement. As you know, that's our long-term goal. We've been doing relatively better than that over time.  It did factor in. We do have inflationary impacts that we're working through this year and some returning costs, things like travel. And we had advanced expansions of our sales organizations internationally in the second half of last year and into early this year. And so it started with a level of growth in costs that we were working to cover through our growth as we always do, while delivering good profit performance. So the 3% calibration in the growth rate is moderating that.  I think that's an appropriate kind of flow through as we pull back a bit on the expected growth. And I think your question is, does that come back? It's not that it is going away, it's can we grow off of that and produce good margin expansion over time? And we believe, absolutely we can. We're committed to our long-term goals and believe we have a really good business model to be able to support that. Nathan Rich : Okay, great. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up, and I know this has kind of been touched on throughout the call. But what are you seeing the industry do to adapt these capacity challenges? And from your standpoint, is it more a staffing issue? Just, maybe some -- hire kind of out of offices during Omicron. Is it issues with getting kind of vet tax? Or is it more of a clinic or kind of vet capacity issue that might take a little bit longer to play out and solve? I'd just be curious, Jay and Brian, to get some additional thoughts that you have around that. Jonathan Mazelsky : Nathan, I think it's a bit of all of the above. From the standpoint of -- so there's clearly a much higher level of activity that they're adapting to and we've talked about the staff shortages. And I think there are some staff out, just related COVID even though it's not resulting in hospitalizations. Normally when people get COVID, they have to spend some time at home.  But there's a number of, I think, proactive things that practices are doing, including investing in technology. We see just a very significant appetite for software and the productivity that the software can deliver, both from the standpoint of staff productivity as well as really being able to enable standard of care. And our solutions, whether it's the ezyVet solution or clinical decision support because that's part VetConnect PLUS is an important part of that.  Also instrumentation and the growth that we're seeing in premium instrumentation, it's really -- it's been very significant, 31% increase in growth in placements, 14% increase in our premium installed base. I think that's reflective of practice owners and veterinarians recognizing that they need to have the latest technology.  In other cases, I think practices are looking at staffing mix and staffing formulas and recognizing that they can increase the number of vet techs and in some cases, non-licensed vet techs, at higher ratios than they have right now, and that can generate higher revenues, they had higher pet owner client support relative to their current baselines. So really looking at a broad range of practices to be able to increase capacity. Operator : Our next question is from Balaji Prasad from Barclays. Balaji Prasad : Thanks, for squeezing me in. So it's kind of an extension of the previous question versus what the veterinary industry can do. I'm curious to see what these challenges mean in terms of capacity constraints for you in terms of the opportunity that it opens up in workflow solutions addressing anything else, both near term and longer term in helping your customers.  And secondly, I just wanted to clarify again on the R&D cost front. Will this mean that your EBIT margin expansion should be back on track from 2023 onwards? Jonathan Mazelsky : Yes. So I'll talk about this, the opportunity. In addition to what I mentioned from a software in a clinic standpoint, our reference laboratory solutions, testing solutions platform really serve as an extension of the practice. So insofar as practices maybe get strained or they want to send out testing and even our medical services.  So we have a very large group of pathologists and boarded some radiologists and internal medicine specialists, they can do that. So we think that, that is a net positive in terms of being able to support the practices and continues to open up opportunity to that effect. Brian McKeon : And on the R&D question, the $80 million investment that we highlighted that will come through our second quarter results, we view as discrete and nonrecurring. And we are maintaining our long-term goals for operating margin expansion. Jonathan Mazelsky : Okay. And with that, I'd like to thank everybody on the phone for their participation this morning and to the IDEXX employees listening. I'd like to say thank you for your continued devotion to our purpose and enduring focus on delivering today. Your unwavering support and engagement enable us to continuously execute at a very high level and support our customers despite unpredictable and evolving dynamics in our sector and around the world. We're thankful for your excellent efforts and look forward to continuing our strong momentum through the rest of '22. And so with that, we'll conclude the call, and thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

Participating in the call this morning are Jay Mazelsky, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian McKeon, Chief Financial Officer; and John Ravis, Vice President, Investor Relations. IDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements. Listeners are reminded that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the forward-looking statements notice in our press release issued this morning as well as in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website, idexx.com. During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. In reviewing our second quarter 2022 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2021, unless otherwise noted. To allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit their questions to one, with one follow-up as necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we will take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, I'll take you through our Q2 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2022. In terms of highlights, continued high levels of IDEXX execution drove solid organic revenue growth in Q2 compared to strong prior year results. Overall, IDEXX revenues increased 6.5% organically, supported by 7% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. Key execution metrics were excellent, reflected an 18% gains in premium instrument placements, continued strong double-digit growth in veterinary software and service revenues and a nearly 1,100 basis point U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth premium to same-store clinical visit levels. For the first half of 2022, overall organic growth was 7.2%, slightly below our expectations for first half growth at the low end of our 7.5% to 10% full year guidance range. These results reflect relatively increased headwinds from lower year-on-year US clinical visit levels, increased macroeconomic impacts in international regions. Profit results were in line with our expectations, supported by sustained high gross margins. EPS was $1.56 per share in the quarter, including $0.72 of impact from discrete R&D investments and $0.06 of net year-on-year impact from the stronger US dollar. As planned, EPS results reflected high operating expense growth, including the impact of $80 million in discrete R&D investments in the quarter and carryover effects from prior commercial investments. As we look forward to the second half of 2022, we're targeting continued solid organic revenue growth, building on the significant expansion of IDEXX's business through the pandemic. We've updated our full year overall organic growth outlook to 5.5% to 8% for 2022, reflecting 6.5% to 9% full year organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. The midpoint of this updated range reflects an outlook for continued solid organic gains in the second half, aided by strong IDEXX execution trends and benefits from incremental price increases. As we'll discuss, vet practices continue to work through capacity constraints and the lapping of high 2021 demand levels supported by the significant growth in new pets during the pandemic. Given these factors in a challenging global economic climate, our midpoint organic growth outlook incorporates expectations for continued pressure on clinical visit levels in the second half of 2022. At the low end of our updated growth range, we've also incorporated an additional 2.5% organic growth risk estimate in the second half related to higher potential macroeconomic impacts on demand. Our EPS outlook of $7.77 to $8.05 reflects our updated organic revenue growth estimates and new estimates for foreign exchange effects based on the continued strengthening of the US dollar. It also reflects expectations for sustained strong full year operating margins flat to 50 basis points below prior year levels, adjusting for foreign exchange effects and $80 million in discrete R&D costs in 2022. We'll walk through the details of our updated P&L outlook later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our second quarter results. Second quarter organic revenue growth of 6.5% was supported by 7% organic gains in our CAG business and 9% organic growth in our water business. These gains were moderated by a 5% organic decline in the LPD revenues,, driven primarily by year-on-year impacts related to reduced African swine fever testing in China. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues increased 7% organically in Q2, compared to strong prior year levels, reflecting 8% gains in the US and 5% growth in international regions. Q2 CAG gains were also supported by 8% organic growth in CAG instrument revenues and 14% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues in addition to benefits from the ezyVet acquisition. In terms of US CAG sector demand drivers, sustained healthy trends supporting increased utilization of diagnostics were moderated by relatively increased year-on-year pressure on clinical visit growth. In Q2, same-store clinical visits were an estimated 3.1% below strong prior year levels. This compares to an updated estimate of 1.4% declines in Q1 and 2.5% to 3% increases in the second half of 2021. Our analysis points to two primary factors driving the recent change in US clinical visit growth trends, reduction in vet clinic capacity from peak pandemic levels and the continued lapping of the significant step-up in demand for pet health care during the pandemic, including benefits from the 10% increase in the pet population in 2020 and 2021. Historically, US clinical visits per practice have grown at approximately 2% to 3% annually, supported by steady vet practice capacity expansion. Between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, US average clinical visits per practice jumped nearly 13%, and these higher absolute visit levels sustained through 2021. Extraordinary efforts by vets and their staff during the pandemic supported the significant increase in demand for clinical services, including diagnostics. In 2022, US clinical visit capacity pulled back from these high levels, impacted by staffing challenges reflected in a 2% contraction in average clinical visit levels in the first half of 2022. This has brought implied vet clinic capacity metrics more in line with longer term expansion trends, while still being below the strong demand in the sector implied by the pet population expansion. We see these specific dynamics is improving over time. However, given the recent pullback in clinic capacity, which continues to be affected by near-term staffing challenges and the lapping of strong underlying demand levels throughout 2021, we believe it's appropriate to plan for continued year-on-year pressure on US clinic visit growth in the second half of this year. Offsetting these near-term growth headwinds is the continued expansion of diagnostics revenue per visit at the clinic level, supported by IDEXX innovation and engagement. While year-on-year clinical visits declined 3% on a same-store basis in Q2, diagnostics revenue per visit expanded nearly 9%, consistent with strong Q1 trends. IDEXX' US CAG Diagnostics organic recurring revenue growth of 7.6% in Q2, continues to outpace solid sector growth trends reflected in the 1,070 basis point premium to clinical visit gains. Jay will talk more about how we're driving sustained strong performance on this front in his comments. Globally, IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue gains across our modalities in the second quarter. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 8% organically, reflecting solid gains across US and international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 15% year-on-year growth in our global premium instrument installed base, reflecting double-digit increases across our catalyst, premium hematology and SediVue platforms. CAG premium instrument placements increased 18% in Q2, reflecting 8% gains in the US and 25% growth internationally, as clinics showed continued confidence in investing towards support of increasing demand for diagnostics globally. The quality of instrument placements continues to be excellent, reflected in 9% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements. ProCyte One momentum continues to build, supported by our global expansion efforts reflected in a 64% year-on-year increase in premium hematology placements in the quarter. Rapid assay revenues expanded solidly in Q2 compared to higher prior year demand levels. Global rapid assay revenues increased 6% organically supported by solid volume gains in the US and benefits from net price increases. Global Lab revenues increased 6%, organically in Q2 as high single-digit growth in the US was moderated by flat organic revenue growth in international regions, reflecting pressure on same-store clinic visit growth in Europe, including increased macroeconomic impacts. Reference Lab, new business momentum and customer retention remains strong globally. We achieved continued solid net price gains in the quarter globally with an average 4% growth benefit to US and worldwide CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues in the first half. Our updated outlook includes benefits from additional US CAG price increases implemented in August ,reflecting product and service enhancements and inflationary impacts. We estimate incremental price changes will provide an additional 1.5% to 2% and growth benefit to worldwide CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues in the second half of 2022. In other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 14% organically and 27% on a reported basis, including benefits from the ezyVet acquisition. Results were supported by double-digit organic gains in recurring software and digital imaging revenues and continued strong momentum in cloud-based software placements. Water revenues increased 9% organically in Q2, reflecting strong performance across regions, including benefits from net price improvements. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenue decreased 5% organically in Q2. Tough comparisons to high prior year revenue levels for African swine fever and core swine testing in China offset moderate overall organic revenue gains in other areas of our LPD business. We've now worked through these comparison impacts and are targeting positive growth in LPD in the second half of this year. Turning to the P&L. Q2 profit results were supported by solid gross profit gains. Gross profit increased 5% in the quarter as reported and 7% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 59.7% in line with high prior year levels on a comparable basis. Benefits from net price gains, lab productivity initiatives and improvement in software service gross margins helped to offset inflationary effects and impacts from lower LPD revenues. Operating expenses increased 46% year-on-year as reported in the second quarter and 48% on a comparable basis, including a 35% OpEx growth impact related to $80 million in discrete R&D investments. Operating expense increases reflect carryover impacts from investments advanced in recent quarters related to our expanded global commercial capability. We're planning for moderated operating expense growth in the second half particularly in the fourth quarter as we gain leverage from these investments and lap more favorable year-on-year comparisons. EPS was $1.56 per share, a decrease of 30% on a comparable basis including a 32% growth impact related to the discrete R&D investment. EPS results included tax benefits of $3 million or $0.03 per share related to share-based compensation, which was down $0.04 per share from high prior year levels. Foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $6 million and EPS by $0.06 per share in Q2, net of $6 million in hedge gains. Free cash flow was $36 million in the second quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 66%. For the full year, we continue to estimate free cash flow conversion of 65% to 70%. This outlook reflects approximately 5% of free cash flow conversion impact from the discrete R&D investments, modestly higher inventory levels to sustain high levels of product availability and higher deferred tax assets. We're maintaining our full year outlook for capital spending of $180 million, including approximately $50 million for our new manufacturing warehouse expansion project. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.4 times gross and 1.3 times net of cash. We allocated $340 million of capital to repurchase 809,000 [ph] shares in Q2. We intend to continue to support our share repurchase program and leverage our strong balance sheet as appropriate on this round. Our financial outlook assumes capital allocation to share repurchases aligned with the consistent net leverage ratio, supporting a projected 2% full year reduction in share count. Turning to our 2022 full year P&L outlook. We're lowering our full year organic revenue growth range by 2% to reflect first half performance, recent care sector trends and to incorporate potential additional impacts from macroeconomic factors at the lower end of our guidance range. We're also adjusting our reported revenue growth outlook for the recent strengthening of the US dollar and updating our EPS outlook to incorporate current expectations for foreign exchange impacts and projected changes in interest rates. Our updated full year revenue growth range of $3.305 billion to $3.385 billion, reflects an $80 million to $85 million reduction compared to earlier estimates. This includes a $20 million adjustment related to the recent strengthening of the US dollar. We now project foreign exchange will reduce year-on-year revenue growth by 3% to 3.5% for the full year with approximately 4.5% of year-on-year headwinds expected in Q3. As noted, we've updated the full year organic revenue growth outlook to 5.5% to 8%. This reflects a full year CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth outlook of 6.5% to 9%. Our updated CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue outlook implies second half organic gains of 5% to 10%. The midpoint of our outlook for H2 reflects CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth of 7.5% or 8% normalized for equivalent days effects, which we estimate will reduce Q3 revenue growth by approximately 1%. Supporting this outlook are benefits from price increases were advancing in the second half of 2022, which we estimate will provide 1.5% to 2% of additional benefit to worldwide H2 CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth building on first half gains of approximately 4%. Net of this incremental price benefit, the midpoint growth outlook for the second half of 2022 is consistent with the global sector growth trends exiting Q2 and reflects expectations for sustained high IDEXX CAG growth premiums supported by continued strong IDEXX commercial execution. The lower end of our second half growth outlook factors in an additional 2.5% organic growth risk estimate related to higher potential macroeconomic impacts on demand. A 5% second half growth rate for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues would align with the low end of growth impact seen in the last recessionary period. The higher end of our growth outlook for the second half targets improved 10% CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth supported by strong IDEXX execution and price increase benefits but will require an improvement in recent clinical visit growth trends. At our updated revenue growth rates, we're now planning for full year operating margins of 26.4% to 26.9%, an adjustment of approximately 50 basis points from our last outlook. This reflects a projected 210 to 260 basis point decrease on a reported basis compared to strong 2021 performance, including approximately 230 basis points of margin impact related to discrete R&D investments. Adjusted for the discrete R&D investments, and approximately 20 basis points of year-on-year net margin benefit from foreign exchange hedges, the high end of this outlook reflects updated goals for relatively flat operating margin gains in 2022 compared to strong prior year levels. The full year operating margin outlook is supported the goals to deliver solid comparable operating margin gains in H2. We're targeting flat to modest comparable operating margin increases in Q3 and higher levels of improvement in Q4 as we benefit from higher net price realization, cost management efforts and the lapping of prior year stepped up investment levels. Our updated EPS outlook is $7.77 to $8.05 per share, including the $0.72 impact from the discrete R&D investments. This represents a decrease of $0.32 per share at midpoint, including $0.05 of impact from higher projected interest rates and $0.03 of additional headwind related to FX. For the full year at our midpoint outlook, we estimate foreign exchange will reduce full year operating profits by $23 million and EPS by $0.21 per share. This is net of an estimated $26 million or $0.23 per share benefit from projected 2022 hedge gains. We provided details on our updated estimates in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Jay Mazelsky : Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX delivered another quarter of solid growth, supported by excellent execution by our global IDEXX teams. Demand for pet health care remains high, building on the step function and sector growth of pets and patient visits during the pandemic. IDEXX is a diagnostics and software partner of choice of veterinary clinicians. This was reflected in record second quarter premium instrument placements, continued high growth in cloud-based PIMS placements in a sustained IDEXX CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth premium to clinical visit growth. Our products support veterinarians by creating an integrated clinic-wide solution that helps them expand capacity and grow their businesses, while providing diagnostic insights to support high levels of pet health care. The solid results that IDEXX delivered in the quarter despite some headwinds from near-term clinical visit growth and international macro factors reinforce our confidence in the durability and long-term growth potential of our business, aligned with increasing care standards for companion animals. Today, I'll discuss our performance and progress in the context of current sector trends in advancing key innovation and commercial initiatives that position us for continued solid growth and financial performance. Let me start by providing some updated context on trends in the companion animal sector. CAG sector trends continue to reflect strong global demand for veterinary services, building on a significant step-up in the number of pets and patient visits observed during the pandemic. US diagnostics revenue per practice grew 6% during the second quarter, against a very strong prior year base, as veterinarians use diagnostics to deliver best care standards, while benefiting from profitable clinical services growth. IDEXX grew US CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue nearly 8%, two points faster, validating the value we bring with differentiated solutions and an excellent customer experience. Specifically, diagnostics remains one of the faster growing areas of the veterinary clinic continuing to outpace both total practice revenue growth and clinical revenue growth on a same-store basis. US diagnostics revenue growth per practice of 6% in the quarter, as noted was once again driven by positive contribution from both diagnostic frequency and utilization. Diagnostics frequency and the utilization gains were both above pre-pandemic trends even at a much higher base. As highlighted in the earnings snapshot, critical use of diagnostics per visit expanded by revenue nearly 9% in the quarter, offsetting headwinds from lower clinical visits. We continue to make progress on initiatives that drive future diagnostics recurring revenue. We saw increased adoption of our US preventive care program where we provide a turnkey diagnostic solution to wellness care, with approximately 225 new enrollments, the largest quarter of enrollment since late 2020. We're also seeing continued momentum across global regions related to the adoption of IDEXX platforms, reflected in 25% growth in international premium instrument placements, including the successful expansion of our ProCyte One platform. These strong areas of progress have been moderated by year-on-year pressure on clinical visit trends. This reflects a combination of impacts from pullback and capacity levels following a period of significant demand expansion, including the step-up in visits related to the 10% expansion of the pet population during the pandemic. In the US, for example, clinics were open around 50% of weekend days in Q2, compared to an average of almost 60% pre-pandemic. We're also seeing some impacts from macroeconomic pressures, particularly in Europe. We think it's prudent to plan on continued year-on-year growth impacts on these fronts in the second half of 2022. Recent research we performed in the US and Germany, shows that a majority of veterinarians indicate staff capacity is a major or moderate issue, while also indicating they see continued higher demand for appointments. As Brian indicated, we are well-positioned with clinics in working through these dynamics over time to address what is likely underserved demand for pet health care in a significantly expanded global pet population. As we work through these near-term headwinds, we're targeting solid organic growth overall in the second half, building momentum that will keep us on track towards our long-term growth goals. Let's now discuss our ongoing progress in key areas of our growth strategy. A key factor in enabling IDEXX to drive strong utilization of diagnostics within the sector, IDEXX\u2019s decade-long focus on building and supporting a world-class commercial team to execute our high-touch model. These capabilities, along with significant new product introductions over the last several years, help our customers grow faster and continue to support strong commercial results. This is reflected in record instrument and software placements, strong EVI games, sustained solid net new business gains in very high customer retention levels. These results demonstrate the market development benefits appearing commercial capabilities with highly relevant innovative products. Our sales professionals have shown an ability to maintain and leverage the deep relationships with customers to support these performance levels despite challenges related to staff capacity, US account manager in-person visits are now over 70% approaching desired end state goals. International access was also excellent at close to 70%, where international growth is a strategic priority, and we're applying the successful US playbook to drive strong placements and new business gains. The second quarter represented continued progress against the strategy with solid year-over-year growth in customer adoption across modalities in Europe. Meanwhile, onboarding and integration of the six country-level commercial expansions have been completed and have gone extremely well. We look forward to ongoing future benefits from these expansions as we work through macro-driven headwinds in regions like Europe, which are constraining near-term organic gains. The international opportunity to drive diagnostics utilization is tremendous, and largely underpenetrated as shared in last year's Investor Day, our advancing global commercial capability and product innovations that fit the requirements of these regions are positioning us to realize significant opportunities over long horizons. Putting the right products and enhance of our capable sales professionals drives continued growth in instrument placements with the resulting highly profitable future consumable streams. Customers on a global basis have never been hungrier for technology that supports care, workflow optimization, excellent clinical performance and friction for use. A key piece of our in-house analyzer portfolio is ProCyte One, the innovative customer-friendly hematology analyzer, which launched last year and has already surpassed an installed base of over 5,000 units. Reception and adoption of ProCyte One has been exceptional, particularly in international regions where many veterinarians were trained to run hematology diagnostics first when doing a basic workup on a patient. We had excellent growth in ProCyte One placements across regions for the second quarter and continued high levels of customer satisfaction and retention, supporting the expansion of our global premium hematology installed base aligned to the approximately 4,000 placements annually as shared in last year's Investor Day. This progress is integral in addressing the estimated opportunity for 200,000 worldwide premium instrument placements. In addition to these targeted investments in enhanced commercial capabilities, technology and product innovation is another key pillar of IDEXX's growth strategy as we endeavor to add value to our product and service offerings. In Q2, we announced three upcoming laboratory tests and service launches. We have a shared mission with our customers to deliver a higher standard of pet health care. And these new products and services support that care delivery to timely and highly accurate diagnostic insights. These innovations also enable our customers to do so in an efficient way by using the IDEXX reference lab as an extension of the veterinarian clinic, which is a key benefit given the current capacity constraints within our sector. These innovations include; number one, expanding Fecal Dx antigen testing to include the detection of fleet taper, the most common type of taper to infect dogs and cats. With this addition, IDEXX's Fecal Dx antigen test detects up to five times more common and prevalent parasites that fecal flotation alone and provides customers with earlier diagnostic insights. This will drive even greater progress towards the goal we shared at Investor Day in 2018 of an incremental $120 million in fecal antigen revenues by 2023. Number two, the addition of FGF-23, a kidney disease management biomarker that will provide clinicians, along with the use of SDMA, not only earlier diagnostic signs of chronic kidney disease but will deliver more confident recommendations for targeted therapy during earlier stages of chronic kidney disease. And number three, a new service of PCR direct testing, which reference US reference lab customers with crucial, timely access to next APCR results, enabled by a new PCR laboratory at our Louisville reference site. The addition of these tests and services support our customers in delivering improved pet health care in ways in which an IDEXX partnership adds long-term increasing value for our customers. In addition to the development of highly relevant, accurately testing products, IDEXX's innovation focus is also on our broad portfolio of software services, including multiple cloud-native PIMs and a variety of tools to manage clinic workflow like Vet Radar, VetConnect PLUS, payment processing solutions and Web PACS. When combined, these products could create a powerful connected ecosystem within the veterinary clinic, which not only improves access to and communication of diagnostic insights but also provides efficiency benefits around the clinic and at each step of the patient visit process. The rapid uptake of IDEXX cloud-based solutions is a reflection of this. Customers understand that modern software tools reduce manual work and increased capacity for clinic staff to focus on higher order patient center tasks. This higher standard of care is further supported by clinical decision support on VetConnect PLUS, which leverages machine learning to offer suggested next steps aligned with care protocols. A great example of this is our enhanced 4Dx Plus introduction, where we not only improved upon our gold standard in a plasma assay, but added a vector-borne disease, clinical decision support module and made significant enhancements to workflow by doubling product shelf life and room temperature storage. We are also seeing incremental follow-up tests for customers engaging with clinical decision support, and we'll share with you at the upcoming Investor Day promising early results. Customers clearly appreciate these benefits as we saw another quarter of record PIMS global placements, supported by continued strong demand for cloud-based offerings. ezyVet in particular, continues to experience strong growth since joining the IDEXX software family. The second quarter placements consistent with the prior quarter and 28% higher than the previous year. These cloud-based solutions enable customers to shift their focus for maintaining on-premise hardware to providing excellent patient care while also benefiting IDEXX through growth of a highly profitable recurring revenue stream in the future. We continue to be very pleased with the advancement of our long-term strategy to integrate diagnostics and software that help IDEXX customers grow faster. Underpinning our growing commercial and technology capabilities is a commitment to providing world-class level of service to our customers, which is integral to earning our customers' business every day, especially given the high levels of demand within the sector. Strong execution against this commitment takes many forms, from consistently high product availability rates to reliable turnaround times at our reference labs. The high service level IDEXX delivered in the second quarter, including greater than 99% product availability demonstrates the benefit of our long-term focus on building supply chain capabilities and highly-scaled manufacturing centers. Our recently communicated US mid-year price increase reflects higher cost to run the business including investments in our supply chain to ensure excellent levels of product continuity and future network resiliency. Given this, IDEXX is well positioned to manage through supply chain and inflationary dynamics, while building on our strong long-term financial performance. This concludes our review. IDEXX's execution levels remain strong and aligned towards our significant and enduring long-term growth potential. We're well positioned to deliver solid growth and financial results as we advance our mission to create a better future for animals, people in our planet. I'm thankful there are more than 10,000 colleagues for their ongoing dedication to our efforts. They are integral in delivering strong financial performance for the company and creating long-term value, while also supporting the advancement of animal care globally. To those listening in on the call, I'd like to extend the heartfelt thanks in making a meaningful difference in the world. Before we open the line for Q&A, I'd like to remind you that my senior management team and I will provide more information on the IDEXX strategy and long-term potential at our upcoming Investor Day. After two years of holding the event virtually, we look forward to hosting the event at our global headquarters in Westbrook, Maine on Thursday, August 11, from 8 :00 to noon. We're also live streaming and recording the event via idexx.com for those who cannot make it in person. Participating will be members of my senior management team, including Dr. Tina Hunt, Executive Vice President and GM for Point of Care Diagnostics and Worldwide Operations; Julie Godon, Vice President and GM for Global Rapid Assay; Mike Lane, Executive Vice President and GM for Reference Laboratories and Information Technology; Michael Schreck, Senior Vice President and GM of Veterinary Software and Services; Jim Polewaczyk, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Brian McKeon, Executive Vice President and CFO. We're also excited to host a live customer conversation led by George Fennell, Senior Vice President and GM of Americas CAG Customer Facing Organization to discuss recent the trends at the clinic level and how IDEXX has supported their business during these pandemic times. The event will last approximately four hours and we'll conclude with a Q&A session and an investor lunch with the extended management team. So with that, we'll end the prepared section of the call and open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : [indiscernible]? Operator : You're addressing from the mic. We cannot hear you. Michael Ryskin : Is that better? Hello? Operator : Here we go. Thank you. Michael Ryskin : Okay. Great. Thanks. Sorry about that. I want to ask on the pricing side of things first, just because we've got a lot of questions on that. Am I understanding correctly that the incremental price you're taking is that you called out in August, the 1.5% to 2%. That's on top of the 4% you took in the first half. And then just sort of how much price do you think you can take until you start seeing a little bit of a pushback. Is this some price you're pulling forward from 2023 in a sense? Just wondering the dynamics there, especially as you talk about weak macro and just uncertain conditions elsewhere? Brian McKeon : Thanks for the question, Mike. Just on the first part, that's correct. So we had approximately a 4% increase in the US and worldwide in the first half and the 1.5% to 2%, we anticipate it will be an incremental worldwide benefits, so that would imply 5.5% to 6% for the second half. I'll let Jay talk to the customer dimension. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. So qualitatively, as Brian indicated, the price increase was really, I think, a reflection of higher costs of running the business. And to your question around pet owner pushback, we don't think that, that's been a driver to date. In fact, pet owners have traditionally prioritized pet health care spend relative to other things. It's a small percentage of total consumable consumer expenditures. So it's a relatively small piece. And we know the human pet owner demand has been strong and growing, and we don't expect that to change. Michael Ryskin : And can I ask a follow-up on the vet visit growth you talked about. Obviously, we're all tracking a lot of the same indicators, and we're seeing how 2Q came in relative to the first quarter. You talked about all the gains in terms of capacity for vet visits in 2020 and 2021. After -- first of all, what's your assumption for vet visit for the rest of the year? If I'm backing into the numbers correctly, you're assuming gradual improvement from 2Q but still sort of like negative for the second half of the year. I want to make sure that's correct? And then at the end of this year, are we normalized then for the gains we made in 2021, or is there more headwinds in 2023? Is there -- are we back to a normal level and then can grow next year off of this in terms of vet visits, or is there still some more digesting of this capacity next year? Thanks. Brian McKeon : So Mike, why don't I walk you through kind of how we're thinking about the outlook analytically and can try to link that back to the underlying sector trends. But just as a grounding, in Q2, the clinical visits year-on-year were down 3%. The revenue per clinical visit was very strong. It was up 8.5%, and that's very positive indicator we think we can build on. But I think the clinical visit levels, as you pointed out, were down relatively to Q1. And we're, I would say, modestly softer than that at the end of the quarter. So as we looked at the midpoint for the second half, if you take the 7.5% midpoint on CAG Dx recurring, there's a days headwind of 1% in Q3. So if we normalize for that, that's 8%. And then if you back off the 1.5% to 2% incremental pricing, it comes up to 6% to 6.5%. So we're basically forecasting that the underlying trends in the sector coming out of Q2 are similar in the second half and that we get incremental benefit from pricing. And the underlying assumptions there are that we're still working through the pullback in capacity that occurred with Fed plans earlier this year. As I mentioned in my comments, there was a big step up from Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, 13%, that's sustained throughout 2021. And then we saw about a 2% pullback in the average visit level in the first half of the year. So that is something that given just ongoing staffing challenges, we think we're still going to be working through that this year. And we're still working through the very strong demand compares to the step-up last year, including the benefits from the pet population expansion. So -- to the latter part of your question, we do think we'll be working through those headwinds through this year, and those should improve, those specific factors should improve as we head into 2023, but we're trying to be realistic on kind of just the near-term trends and the headwinds given the dynamics that we continue to see through Q2, and we think that's prudently reflected in our outlook. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. The other thing I would add to that, Mike, is if you take a look at the net expansion in the number of pets visits in the pandemic. I mean there's -- I think there's some evidence that there's a potential underserved demand given this 10% growth. If you take a look at just extrapolate out the 2% to 3% clinical visit trend. We saw pre-pandemic and add in the number of pets, the clinical visits should be higher just based on pet population. So I think as profession works through some of the capacity constraints that we've talked about, I think the -- we'll see a recovery from there. Operator : We have our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Hi, great. Thanks so much. I was just trying to get a little bit of clarification on the guidance change as returning dissects, I guess this vet visit growth dynamic versus some of the softening demand you referenced in Europe. So can you just maybe quantify how much of the, I guess, 200 basis point or so change in organic guidance is from those two factors? And maybe just on elaborating on the macroeconomic side, where are you seeing the greatest impacts here? Is this kind of broadly across Europe, or are you seeing specific markets that are seeing greater pressures than elsewhere? Thanks so much. Brian McKeon : Yes, Chris, thanks for your question. The adjustment that we made is principally to reflect the more recent trends we're seeing both in the US and in Europe, principally around the visit trends. I think our execution levels have remained quite strong. We feel good about that. I think the underlying revenue per visit utilization dynamics, as you can see in the metrics are holding up well. And we think we can build on that. But the adjustment is principally to reflect the more recent trends, which were more aligned with the lower end of the outlook. Going back to our earlier guidance, we had talked about the lower end reflecting that some of the pressures continue, and that's what we've -- on visits, and that's what we've seen through the second quarter, and we think we're adjusting for that appropriately. I think we're reflecting in the full range that there's some opportunity for improvement in the second half. I think that to Jay's point, I think there's underlying demand that we believe is out there. And that the clinics can adapt and improve the capacity dynamics, I think that could be a positive factor. And of course, we're trying to highlight that there's some potential for additional macro risk that's more difficult to calibrate, but I think we're cognizant that, that could be a factor as well. So on balance, I think we think we're appropriately adjusting the outlook and reflecting the more recent trends. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. Let me just maybe directly address your question around geographic balance. So we've done a number of different surveys, both in the US and Germany is our largest country in Europe. And what we're seeing is the majority of veterinarians indicate that stack capacity is a major or moderate issue. Not to say the macro effects, especially in Europe, we're seeing some impact from that primarily more so on the reference labs than in-clinic testing. And not surprising when you consider some of the factors that our European sector and regions are dealing with in terms of inflation and energy and the Ukraine-Russian war is much closer to them. Operator : Our next question is from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. Another question on the macro. If I heard you correctly here, I guess, you mentioned that the lower end of the guidance embeds a growth expectation similar to what you experienced during the prior economic downturns here. But what the difference across your business now versus, for instance, 2008, 2009 that would make you I guess, more or less insulated from a more challenging economic backdrop here. And as I think about what was going on during that time, for instance, the Catalyst Dx launch, those initiatives may be leaving you differently positioned than maybe you would going into a tougher economic backdrop, particularly here in the US? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Good morning. Erin, thanks for the question. Yeah, I think we're in a much stronger position than we were back in 2008, 2009 on a couple of, I think, very important dimensions. Our sales channel, we worked through distributors over a decade ago. And now we have a direct presence in 99% plus from a revenue standpoint. So we have those direct relationships with customers, our portfolio from an innovation standpoint is much more robust across the board, both reference labs, in-clinic software, for example. So I think we offer veterinarians a lot more tools and technology to help manage their practices. I think if anything, that had on our pet bond has grown and is stronger than it was a decade ago. And I think the industry itself, the profession itself is more sophisticated in managing through cycles. I think they're they have adopted a number of, I think, business practices, whether it's individual practices or the corporately owned practices in terms of managing care. So I think we're overall in a much stronger position than we were. Erin Wright : Okay, great. Thanks. And then can you give us an update on innovation, and I'm sure we'll hear about this at the Investor Day. But how do you think about the recent discrete R&D investments that you made as well as the innovation that you called out in your prepared remarks here? And when will these efforts generate material contributions for you? And will this ultimately help bridge the gap between the macro capacity headwinds that you could see and continue to see in your historical long-term growth rates? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. So from an innovation standpoint, I think we've never been more productive. If you look out over the last couple of years and the type of innovations really across the board from instrumentation, testing, services, software. So if you take a look at the instrumentation piece, ProCyte One has just been an incredible success our customers, I think, have responded exceptionally well to it. They love the fact that it's very easy to use. The performance is very high, and it's priced from an economic standpoint, in the sweet spot of the marketplace. So we've seen really dramatic uptake in our international regions, which is not surprising. A lot of those countries or regions are hematology first marketplaces. And the nice thing about hematology is it's hard to do. It's really hard to do well, and there's a multiplier impact. Typically, we sell with chemistry increasingly with SediVue, as part of in-clinic suites. And then on the software front, I think we're all familiar with the challenges that practices are facing from a workflow and staff productivity and client communication standpoint. So I think practices, which have traditionally relied on on-premise software solutions are looking at contemporary cloud-based solutions as a way to address some of those challenges, and we've seen really rapid uptake in our cloud-based PIMS portfolio, whether it's ezyVet or deal or Anima [ph] in some of our country and regions internationally. From a testing standpoint, we continue to -- as I mentioned in my remarks for reference labs, we've had a number of important introductions over the last couple of months and especially in fecal antigen with flea tapeworms expanding the portfolio for that. It's a fast-growing, I think very important franchise that we have, takes five times -- is up to five times as much compared to flotation or O&P. So it's an important part of the overall reference labs because customers, when they use preventive care panels, it fecals a piece of it, but an important piece of it. So a lot of the I think testing is either anchored or driven by the need for fecal. So overall, we're very excited. We're excited by the in-licensing agreements that we struck and we'll continue to provide updates on that over time, including at Investor Day. So look forward to being able to talk more about that. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. Jon Block : Thanks, guys. Good morning. Both questions might be centered around price in some way. But when I think about the Dx recurring growth price, for 2022, it looks like it's shaking out around 300 bps. So in other words, the 8% CAG, the ex-recurring midpoint guidance, less roughly 500 basis points of full year price, Brian, if I've got that correct. And historically, you've been closer to 1,000 bps, give or take. You've been growing CAG Dx recurring around 12%. And price was closer to 200 to 300 bps. So maybe some color on that compression of, call it, growth ex-price. Is there anything to call out other than comps, such as less incremental contribution from innovation or maybe what you're even seeing from a market share perspective for that rate of compression? Brian McKeon : Jon, I am trying to follow your math, but I think that we're not signaling a fundamental compression in the underlying kind of growth in excess of kind of visit levels, excluding kind of price changes. I think we've got a benefit this year. We're roughly 1,100 basis point premium in the US in the first half with 4% pricing that would imply kind of closer to the higher end of that 900 to 1,000 basis point range that we saw pre-pandemic. And our outlook for the year underlying it, we're not specifically forecasting clinical visit growth, but it's more of the trends that we saw coming out of Q2 would imply consistently high levels, and we're not trying to signal compression on that front. So I think we're -- that's something that we need to continue to execute well against. I think that can be impacted by consumer factors at the margin. So I don't want to say that those are things that we're not considering, but I think our midpoint outlook signals that we think we can continue to deliver well on that front and get some additional benefit from some pricing and that will support our solid full year numbers and second half numbers. Jon Block : Okay. And maybe just to clarify, Brian, and it might be the same answer, then we can move on. But I'm not talking about, I guess, maybe -- I'm not talking about the premium to underlying clinical visits. I'm just looking at your CAG Dx recurring midpoints around 8% growth, you've got a 500 basis point contribution from price. So CAG Dx ex-price is around 300 basis points. And previously, it had been 900 basis points or 1,000, right? Your CAG Dx is growing 12%, your price was 200 to 300 basis points. So why if we normalize for the contribution from price and we throw that out, the growth just looks like a fraction this year versus prior years. And I'm guessing some of that's attributable to the comps is sort of where I'm going with it. But are there other components to it where you're getting less of an incremental contribution from innovation or less market share gains. That's where I was going with it just to clarify. And again, it might be the same answer we can move on, but hopefully, that was a better question, if you would. Brian McKeon : Yeah. And Jon, it's principally the swing in the clinical visit growth. I mean, we're growing 3% and declining 3% in Q3. So that's 600 basis points. I mean, I think our underlying execution and delivery has been quite good. And -- but -- and the swing in that is, as we mentioned, two factors. It's the pullback in the clinic capacity after a significant period of expansion and retroactive clinics couldn't sustain. And I think we believe can adapt to that over time. And I think that we've got -- we are lapping some of the step-up in the -- the big step-up in demand we saw in the pandemic, including the benefits from the patient expansion. So I think for 2022, that's kind of the key factor that we've been working through. That's the key adjustment in our full year outlook this year. We, obviously, had to make some changes. And this is the change in trend from the second half of 2021, but that's change in the visit level is the clinical visit growth levels is the key difference in terms of where we. Jon Block : That's helpful. I've got -- yeah, I've got that swinging 400 bps plus two to minus two and ex-price compressing 600 to 700 bps, but it gets me a lot closer, and I could follow up offline. So that's why I was asking about market share innovation. Maybe just to shift gears and the second question is still in and around price. I'm just curious, Brian, is it uniform across all your CAG modalities in terms of consumables, lab, rapids. And more importantly, are your competitors following on price for both the point of care and reference lab? And if they're not, what does that say, if anything, about your ability to take the same rate of price increase, the same magnitude into 2023? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. Jon, this was across consumables and reference not capital, and it was a -- primarily a US driven change. Jon Block : Sorry, Jay. Point of -- I didn't ask capital. Point of care in the reference labs across all your modalities of CAG Dx recurring and have your competitors followed suit the best of your knowledge? And if not, what does it say about your ability to take price in? Jay Mazelsky : We don't have any insight in terms of what competitors or competitive landscape is up to. Brian McKeon : It is reflective of the overall inflationary environment. So I think that that's a broader factor that I think everyone in the industry is dealing with. Jon Block : Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : We have our next question from Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James. Elliot Wilbur : Thanks. Good morning. I understand the granularity on ex US visit trends is a little bit more difficult to attain. But just wondering if you could comment in general, whether or not seeing the same level of deceleration in clinic visit trends ex-US versus US? Any perspective on that? And then more specifically on the performance or relative performance US versus ex US in the reference lab business, differential in growth rate is this purely just a function of difference in clinic visit trends, or are there other factors that continue to lead to the substantial over performance in the US versus international such as price and utilization? Thanks. Brian McKeon : Yes, to your point, to your question, visibility internationally. So we don't have the same size PIMS installed base across the different regions. So we don't have that type of pinpoint accuracy we do in North America. I would say that we're seeing similar trends based on other data. I think it's a reflection of some of the same capacity, challenges in the practices because we know during the pandemic, we saw the same pet boom in countries like the UK, Germany, Australia, what have you. I think the overall factor we see internationally, specifically in Europe is we do see some of the macro impacts that does impact reference labs more so than point-of-care, not surprisingly, there's not as big a wellness or preventive care business internationally, but there -- it's probably 20% or so of the visits, and that's primarily a reference lab modality. So we do see some headwinds connected to that. Operator : We have our last question from Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Ryan Daniels : Yes, thanks for taking the question, guys. I want to take a little bit of a different approach and get any insights you have on what type of IT investments you can make in the near or intermediate term to help your customers increase capacity. So I'm thinking things like digital intake platforms or self-service billing, et cetera. Is that a high priority for you? And do you think that's something that can actually help with throughput for your customers and alleviate some of this pressure? Jay Mazelsky : Good morning, Ryan. We see pretty much across the board, whether it's independent practices or corporate practices, an incredible hunger for those type of IT tools, not just systems, but PIM systems, which provide the pinner-engagement modules, which allow them for \u2013 yes, if you take a step back, about 15%, what practice owners tell us, about 15% of their staff time is focused on just that patient intake piece and administration of the patient. And a lot of that can be automated. A lot of that could be done virtually like it's done in other industries. So the ability to use and deploy these software tools for client communications, for workflow optimization and every step of the patient visit is a high priority for these practices. And I mean -- and we're seeing that in our software business, where we've seen very rapid growth. And I think historically, practices have been somewhat hesitant to move away from PIM systems because the data and they've been trained on it and they have all the reports on it, but they're willing to make that switch now because they see the benefits of what a modern software suite can bring. So I think that's a -- that's only going to get stronger over time as work to address some of the capacity challenges. Brian McKeon : Okay. And with that, I'd like to thank everybody on the phone for their participation this morning and to IDEXX employees listening, I'd like to just say thank you for your continued devotion to our purpose on wavering, engagement, enable us to continuously execute at a very high level and support our customers despite the unpredictable and evolving dynamics in our sector and around the world. Thankful for your excellent effort and look forward to continuing our strong momentum through the rest of 2022. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

To allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit their questions to one, with one follow-up as necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we will take your additional questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. In terms of highlights, IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue and profit growth in Q3, building on strong prior results. Overall, IDEXX revenues increased 8% organically supported by 9% organic growth and CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Key execution metrics remain strong. This is reflected in record Q3 premium instrument placements, double digit growth in veterinary software and digital imaging revenues and 10% organic growth and U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Operating profits and EPS increased 12% and 13% respectively, on a comparable basis reflecting solid gross margin gains and controlled operating expense growth. Outstanding execution in the quarter has us on track to deliver a strong full year financial performance aligned with our updated guidance range In terms of our full year operational outlook, we've incorporated our Q3 organic growth results and maintained a similar midpoint estimate for EPS performance, supported by strong second half comparable operating profit gains. We've also adjusted our reported revenue and EPS outlook to reflect updated estimates for foreign exchange impacts. We'll walk through the details of a full year outlook later my comments. Let's begin with a review of our third quarter results. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 8% was supported by solid organic gains across our major business segments, including 8% organic growth in our CAG business, 12% organic growth in water and 7% organic growth and LPD revenue. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue increased 9% organically in Q3 compared to strong prior levels, reflecting 10% gains in the U.S. and 6% growth in international regions net of a 1% equivalent day growth headwind. We achieved double digit organic growth benefits from key execution drivers, including expansion of our premium instrument base, consistent new business gains sustained high customer retention levels, and solid expansion of diagnostic revenues per clinical visit, including benefits from higher net price realization. These gains helped IDEXX to deliver continued solid CAG recurring revenue growth, offsetting near term headwinds related to year-on-year declines in clinic visit levels globally, including effects from a pullback in clinic capacity this year, and macro impacts in international markets. Overall, organic revenue gains are also supported by 15% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues. CAG instrument revenue was down modestly compared to high prior levels, as strong placement gains were moderated by mix effects. In terms of CAG sector demand drivers continued healthy trend support and solid increases in diagnostic revenues at U.S. clinics. Diagnostic revenue increased 7% on the same store basis in the U.S. in Q3, to approximately 9.5% on a per visit basis, reflecting continued solid gains in diagnostic frequency and utilization, including benefits from higher net price realization at the practice level.  Clinical visit levels in Q3 were down 2.4%, a slight improvement from Q2 trends as we continue to work through impacts from reductions in debt clinic capacity from peak levels and the lapping of the significant step up and demand for pet healthcare during the pandemic. We anticipate year-on-year visit growth headwinds will continue in the fourth quarter, which is factored into our outlook IDEXX's U.S. CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth of 9.6% in Q3, which included a 1% equivalent day's growth headwind, continues to outpace sector growth trends. The strong performance was supported by a 1,300 basis point normalized growth benefited from IDEXX execution drivers. This included consistent growth benefits from IDEXX utilization and innovation gains and customer additions and an estimated 6% net price benefit in the U.S. supported by our second half price initiatives. Globally, IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue growth across our modalities in Q3. IDEXX VetLab consumables revenues increased 9% organically reflecting solid gains across U.S. and international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 14% year on year growth in our global premium instrument installed base, reflecting double digit increases across our catalyst premium hematology and set of new platforms. We placed 4,737 CAG premium instrument placements in Q3, an increase of 10% year-on-year building on the record placement levels achieved in the third quarter of 2021. The quality of instrument placements continues to be excellent reflecting 30% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements, compared to strong prior levels. ProCyte One momentum also continues to build globally supporting a 26% year on year increase in premium hematology placements in the quarter. Global rapid asset revenues expanded 7% organically in Q3 compared to high prior demand levels, supported by benefits from that price increases. Global Lab revenues increased 8% organically in Q3 as double digit growth in the U.S. was moderated by modest organic revenue growth in international regions, reflecting pressure on same store clinic visit growth in Europe, including macroeconomic impacts. We continue to achieve solid new business momentum and sustained high customer retention levels across our major modalities, supporting sustained solid volume growth. CAG recurring revenue growth, including net price benefits in the range of 5% to 6% to worldwide CAG diagnose recurring revenues in the quarters reflecting product and service enhancements and coverage of inflationary impacts.  In other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 15% organically. Results were supported by double-digit organic gains in recurring software and digital imaging revenues and continued strong momentum in cloud-based software placements. Water revenues increased 12% organically in Q3, reflecting strong performance across our major regions, including benefits from solid volume gains and net price improvement. We completed the acquisition of Tecta-PDS in the quarter, an automated microbiology testing platform which complements our existing water offering and expands our capabilities in this highly attractive business segment. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue increased 7% organically in Q3. Results benefited from growth in the herd health screening and improved results in China, where we work through comparisons to high prior year revenue levels for African swine fever core swine testing. Turning to the P&L. Q3 profit results were supported by solid gross profit gains. Gross profit increased 7% in the quarter as reported and 10% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 60.2% up 120 basis points on a comparable basis. Benefits from net price gains, lab productivity initiatives, improvement in software service gross margins and business mix offset inflationary cost effects. Operating expenses increased 6% year-on-year as reported in the third quarter and 9% on a comparable basis. As planned, operating expense growth was more in-line with revenue gains as we prioritize investments and gained leverage from our prior commercial expansions. EPS was $2.15 per share, an increase of 13% on a comparable basis. Q3 EPS results did not include tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which were down $0.05 per share from high prior year levels. Foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $8 million and EPS by $0.08 per share in Q3 net of $9 million in hedge gains. Free cash flow was $151 million in the third quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion rate was 67%. For the full year, we've updated our estimate of free cash flow conversion to 60% to 65% to incorporate expectations for continued higher inventory levels aligned with sustaining high product availability.  The full year outlook reflects approximately 20% of free cash flow conversion impact this year from discrete R&D investments, higher inventory levels, higher deferred tax assets driven by increased R&D tax credits and an investment in the major facility expansion. We've updated our full year outlook for capital spending to approximately $165 million, including $40 million to $50 million in 2022 spending for our new manufacturing and warehouse project. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.4 times gross and 1.3 times net of cash. We increased our financing flexibility with the recently completed credit facility amendment, which provides for a $250 million term loan on attractive terms with proceeds applied to reducing our revolving credit balance. In Q3, we allocated $167 million of capital to repurchase 453,000 shares. Capital allocation to share repurchases supports our projected 2% full year reduction in share count this year. Turning to our 2022 full year P&L outlook. We're narrowing the organic revenue growth range to incorporate our solid Q3 performance and a consistent outlook for Q4 organic revenue growth aligned with the midpoint of our prior second half guidance. We're also maintaining our full year outlook for comparable operating margins, which sustained strong prior year levels, adjusting for the impact of the discrete $80 million R&D investment recorded in Q2. We're updating our reported revenue and EPS outlook to reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which we estimate will reduce 2022 revenue by $10 million and EPS by $0.04 per share compared to our last outlook. We're also factoring in a $0.01 per share adjustment for projected changes in interest rates. Overall, our updated full year revenue growth range of $3.325 billion to $3.365 billion is consistent at midpoint with earlier estimates as FX impacts offset improvements to our operational outlook. We now project FX will reduce year-on-year revenue growth by 4% for the full year with approximately 6% of year-on-year headwinds expected in Q4. Our updated full year organic revenue growth outlook is now 6.5% to 7.5%, reflecting a full year CAG Diagnostics organic recurring revenue growth outlook of 7.5% to 8.5%. Our updated CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue outlook implies fourth quarter organic gains of 5% to 10%, aligned with earlier estimates, which factors in a 2.5% organic growth risk estimate at the low end of the range for potential macroeconomic impacts on demand. We've updated our estimated full year operating margins to 26.3% to 26.8%, reflecting consistent operational outlook at midpoint and an estimated 10 basis points in year-on-year net margin impact from updated foreign exchange estimates. This outlook reflects a projected 230 to 280 basis point decrease on a comparable basis compared to strong 2021 performance, including approximately 230 basis points of operating margin impact related to the discrete R&D investments. Our updated EPS outlook is $7.74 a share to $7.98 per share, including the $0.72 impact from the discrete R&D investments. This represents a decrease of approximately 5% per share at midpoint, reflecting updated estimates for FX and interest rate impacts. For the full year, we estimate foreign exchange will reduce full year operating profits by approximately $28 million and EPS by $0.25 per share. This is net of an estimated $29 million or $0.26 per share benefit from projected 2022 hedge gains. Our outlook factors in no EPS impact from stock-based compensation tax benefits in the second half. We provided details on our updated outlook in the tables in our press release and earnings snapshot. Looking forward, we're advancing our planning processes for 2023. We're targeting sustained strong execution that supported delivery of solid organic revenue and comparable profit growth, building on substantial financial gains IDEXX achieved through the pandemic. Given the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar this year, in 2023, we estimate that foreign exchange will reduce reported revenue growth by approximately 3%, reported operating margins by approximately 70 basis points and EPS by approximately $0.45 per share at the rates assumed in our press release with current hedge positions. We'll provide updates on these estimates as we share our 2023 guidance on the year-end conference call.  That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Jay Mazelsky : Thank you, Brian, and good morning. I'm pleased to share that IDEXX delivered strong results in the third quarter, as teams across the company continued excellent execution to advance our strategic priorities. Demand for Companion Animal health care remains high, building on stepped-up levels there in the pandemic supported by a continued focus on service within veterinary clinics. Veterinarians are looking for partners to support their growth while they provide high levels of care in an efficient manner.  These professionals continue to turn to IDEXX for the support in the third quarter. This was reflected in yet another quarter of record placements of premium capital instruments, strong momentum in PIMS placements its continued desire for cloud-native products, consistent new business gains and sustained high customer retention levels. These continued trends demonstrate that veterinarians appreciate IDEXX's integrated ecosystem, and the layers of innovation would support and improve each step of clinic workflows. The result was expansion across IDEXX execution growth drivers, including relatively higher net price realization, which drove IDEXX CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth to significantly outpace clinical visit growth. This supported a solid same-store diagnostics revenue growth in the U.S. despite moderating impacts from reductions in clinic capacity levels this year. This morning, I'll highlight how IDEXX continued to advance our key strategic initiatives in the quarter while delivering strong financial results. I'll begin with a review of recent trends in the companion animal sector. Third quarter CAG sector trends were supported by solid global demand for veterinary services, building on a significant step-up in pet ownership and patient visits during the pandemic. U.S. same-store diagnostics revenues grew 7% per practice during the third quarter, a sequential increase from the prior quarter and well above total same-store practice revenue growth of 4% in the quarter. Services remain a key focus for veterinarians. And within services, diagnostics is a key component in providing valuable health care insights, supporting practice economics and driving revenue growth. Consistent with trends through this year, diagnostics revenue growth at the practice level continues to be driven by increases in both the frequency and utilization of diagnostics, resulting in 9.5% growth in diagnostics revenue per visit for the quarter, building on the strong gains seen through the pandemic. IDEXX grew overall U.S. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue at approximately 10% normalized despite recent clinic visit growth headwinds as we benefit from decades of focus and investment, which brings differentiated value to our customers. As Brian noted, IDEXX execution drivers contributed approximately 1,300 basis points to U.S. growth in Q3 on a normalized basis. This reflects benefits from continued expansion of our premium instrument installed base, adoption of IDEXX innovations, consistent business gains, record retention levels and increased price realization. On a multiyear basis, critical visit growth was healthy in the quarter with solid growth in both wellness and non-wellness visits. three-year CAGR wellness visit growth, in particular, was in line with historic trends of 2% to 3%, demonstrating that U.S. pet owners are continuing to prioritize pet health care. This trend continues to be supported by IDEXX's turnkey Preventive Care program, which included approximately 200 new U.S. enrollments in the quarter. This is the second quarter of year-over-year increased enrollments, showing that customers continue to appreciate the simple yet comprehensive testing and pet owner communication tools included in this program. This program is just one example of how we are engaging with our customers to support them through near-term challenges related to managing clinic capacity in meeting growing demand for health care services. We are building on our strong customer relationships to drive continued solid organic growth in our CAG business. With that, let's now turn to discuss IDEXX's strong progress against our key strategic growth initiatives. As mentioned, excellent execution across the IDEXX organization supported strong performance during a dynamic third quarter with commercial teams delivering the day while also building the foundation for long-term growth across regions. Record quarterly placements of premium instruments supported another quarter of double-digit growth in our worldwide premium instrument installed base.  Global premium instrument placements grew 10% in the quarter. and placements in new and competitive accounts grew even faster at 13%, supporting strong EVI gains across regions. These results, combined with continued sustained new business gains and 98% Catalyst customer retention rates, will support future recurring revenue growth aligned with the long-term financial framework shared at our recent Investor Day. Sustained high levels of commercial performance were aided in part by continued improvement in the rate of in-person visits for account managers, up to 75% in the U.S. and nearly 70% in Europe. IDEXX sales representatives are welcome in the clinic as trusted advisers to their customers, adding value by helping customers provide high standards of medical care, drive strong practice economics and improve practice efficiency. These results are also supported by our world-class innovative products like ProCyte One and customer-friendly marketing programs that help support the adoption of IDEXX Innovations. ProCyte One provides customers with an efficient lower-cost hematology platform at the point of care and is especially sought after in international regions where veterinarians have been trained to do hematology testing first when doing a basic workup on a patient. This platform is integral to our strategy to address the approximately 230,000 long-term global instrument placement opportunity that Dr. Tina Hunt shared at Investor Day, and third quarter results continue to be very encouraging. ProCyte One was a key driver of 26% growth in premium hematology placements in the quarter with international regions representing approximately 75% of ProCyte One placements and more than 60% of its installed base. Attach rates for ProCyte One are consistently high. Over 95% of ProCyte One customers overall and more than 80% of competitive customers also utilize our chemistry platform, demonstrating the excellent placement quality and strong multiplier benefit of this platform. These results are further supported by benefits from investments we have made to expand our global commercial organization, where we are seeing positive reach to revenue trends and deeper customer relationships. Customer survey work in Germany and France demonstrates that customers have had an overwhelmingly positive experience during the first year of the new commercial ecosystem.  Over 90% of customers in Germany, for example, indicate that their commercial experience is the same or better than a year ago with the highest satisfaction rates and practices to receive continuous commercial engagement. This feedback highlights the benefit of our high-touch commercial model, where diagnostic subject matter experts partner with practice centers and staff to drive practice patient care and business objectives. Our commercial and operational teams in the Asia-Pacific region are also driving successful execution against our strategic plans. Asia-Pacific premium instrument placements are at a record high and were delivered while hiring and onboarding new sales professionals in Japan and opening a new reference lab in Brisbane, Australia during the quarter. Concurrent seamless execution of our commercial investments across multiple regions is not easy to do and to do so while also delivering against our business goals. This demonstrates the value of the investments we've made in these teams, which will continue to benefit us as we work to address the significant long-term addressable opportunity outside the U.S. In addition to these excellent commercial results, we also delivered multiple new technologies to our customers during the quarter. Since VMX in January, we have announced eight new product service and software solution enhancements across IDEXX modalities, each of which add value to the relationship that customers have with IDEXX while demonstrating our commitment to a technology for life strategy. Five out of eight of these projects were launched in the third quarter. These are number one, expanding the comprehensiveness of our fecal antigen reference lab test by adding a flea tapeworm assay, which now detects up to 5 times more than traditional methods. Number two, providing faster access to PCR results for North American customers by opening a next day PCR lab in Louisville.  Number three, improved veterinary insight into the treatment of feline chronic kidney disease by adding an improved disease marker, FGF23, to our reference lab menu. Number four, improving the efficiency, convenience and sustainability of the Catalyst SDMA test by reformulating the test to include onboard reagents. And number five, delivering enhanced accuracy and longer room temperature storage in our best-in-class 4Dx Plus Test.  The rollout of these new products and services was enthusiastically received by our customers and highlighted the IDEXX team's ability to deliver high-quality new products, which will help increase standards of animal health care and develop our sector while also providing very high customer service levels. Another strategic area of innovation is IDEXX's software and diagnostic imaging businesses, which include a full suite of software product offerings to create a connected ecosystem within the clinic that supports each step clinic workflow through the patient appointment, the practice information management system and its easily updatable customer-friendly front-end interface is the center of this solution. Record third quarter PIMS placements highlight strong customer interest the whole product solution at IDEXX offers. Furthermore, the shift to cloud-based products that we highlighted at Investor Day continued in the quarter as over 90% of placements were cloud-based subscriptions, reflecting 50% growth in cloud-based placements compared to the prior year and demonstrating the value that last year's ezyVet acquisition continues to bring to the business. Strong results across this business in the quarter were not limited to PIMS products, diagnostic imaging systems placements, Web PACS subscriptions, PIMS application adoption like payment processing and VetConnect PLUS with clinical decision support, engaged with all advanced at healthy levels in the quarter. We know veterinarians are looking for ways to obtain, understand and communicate diagnostics insights in a digital and streamlined way, and our software portfolio is well positioned to provide them with these solutions. The benefits of these products and solutions to IDEXX and our customers are compelling. They have highly favorable economics given the recurring nature of the revenue stream and high incremental gross margins. They also drive customer engagement, which supports a high levels of retention since they improve our customers' productivity and overall experience. IDEXX's innovation agenda also extends beyond our Companion Animal business. We recently took the opportunity to advance our water business by acquiring Tecta Pathogen Detection System, with an automated microbiology detection platform that uses patented technology to automate the incubation, reading and results notification for E. Coli and total coliform testing and drinking water supplies. This application provides an automated data-enabled instrument in EPA-approved coliform testing solution that complements our core water solutions by providing value for customers operating under rushed conditions. We're excited to be able to invest in the attractive area of water testing and leverage our commercial resources to scale this new technology. This innovation agenda demonstrates a relentless focus on providing our customers with world-class products that increase in value over time. Products not only provide them with important insights but also help increase workflow efficiency and effectiveness.  In addition to these top-notch products, our customer focus is supported by extremely high service levels to ensure customers have a wonderful experience with IDEXX, allowing us to earn their business every day. Our frontline supply chain and customer service teams continue to deliver high levels of service, reflected in another quarter of approximately 99% product availability despite ongoing challenges in the external environment. This strong performance leverages years of investment in our supply chain and customer support resources as we continue to deliver on the operational needs of our customers. That concludes our review. I'm proud to report another quarter of strong results as IDEXX remains well positioned to deliver solid growth and financial results over the long run while also delivering on our mission to create a better future for animals, people in our planet. Our performance reflects the commitment and talent of our IDEXX team.  On behalf of the management team, I'd like to thank our more than 10,000 colleagues for the passion and engagement they bring to our purpose and strategy every day. You're making a meaningful difference to the health and well-being at pets, people and buy stock around the world. So now we'll end the prepared section of the call and open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the question. I was just trying to get a little bit more color on how you're thinking about vet visit growth dynamics as we look out to 2023. I don't know if it's premature to get a view there. But maybe just, qualitatively, can you just elaborate on what you think needs to happen for vet visit growth to start growing again and I guess just where we are in that process as we're trying to get -- hands around kind of the trajectory of the business as we look out to next year? Thank you. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, sure. Good morning, Chris. We expect we'll work through the impacts of the pullback in capacity this year in 2023. The overall clinic visit growth, as you indicated in the outlook, it still remains fairly dynamic. There's a lot of external factors like macro impacts, the labor supply dynamics that we've talked about and even potential impacts from further COVID outbreak. So we'll be monitoring those macro impacts as a pet owner behavior and really factor that into our outlook.  What I would point out is that our focus is on those things that we can control from an execution standpoint, both innovations and commercial engagement with our commercial teams. And we continue to do extremely well in being able to support customers with technology, whether it's PIMS systems, software, which help their productivity and support their efficiency. Clinic instrument placements -- in-clinic instrument placements were at record levels. I think that reflects at a basic level that there is a very positive outlook on the industry, and their willingness to invest, it really supports growth. We think that, from an overall dynamic standpoint, Europe is a little bit different. But in the U.S., capacity constraints are the primary factor affecting clinical visits versus end customer demand. In Europe, we're seeing some impacts from just the back row factors, and we'll see how that plays out and whether that continues going forward. Chris Schott : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin of Bank of America Global Research. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Bhuvan [ph] on for Mike. Thanks for taking questions. It looks like you -- as you mentioned, the oU.S. results were a bit softer this quarter. I was wondering if you could just go a little deeper into what you're seeing internationally and your expectations for how trends will look there going forward versus the U.S. Brian McKeon : Thanks for your question. In international markets, we're seeing similar dynamics in terms of IDEXX execution. So the we highlighted in our comments that we think we got a 1,300 basis point benefit from the combination of things like new business gains, expansion of our premium instrument installed base, price utilization. And we actually think our numbers are roughly in a similar zone in international markets. I think what we're seeing more in international markets is some pressure on the clinical visit growth levels. You can see that in our lab growth, which was up modestly in the quarter despite these new business gains and solid price gains.  So it's -- I think international market has been relatively more impacted by the macro dynamics, particularly in regions like Europe. And we've been seeing that really going back to Q4 of last year. So that's been a relatively more meaningful headwind, but the progress that we're making and the very strong instrument placement gains and continued high retention levels, excellent level -- excellent engagement with our customers is allowing us to deliver solid, continued growth. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. Just to add to that, the fit of our in-clinic instruments now with ProCyte One is outstanding for these international markets. We saw ProCyte One growth 26%, as I indicated in my comments. And so from a footprint, price, performance, connectivity, ease-of-use standpoint, it really fits us international markets very well. The international customers, it depends based on country or region, but they tend to test hematology first. So it's a really important solution for these customers and has a big multiplier impact because very often when we sell ProCyte One, we also sell it with a chemistry analyzer and, in some cases, even a SediVue. So we feel very positive about solutions and our ability to help customers achieve their objectives. Certainly, there's a macro factors that we've talked about in the past, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict in the energy prices, and we'll just continue to monitor that and see how that plays out over time. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Much appreciated. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks for taking my question s. So on pricing, where do we stand now in terms of net price realization for the year? What's embedded in guidance? And what's that relative to what you were disclosing last quarter? And then are there further price increases, I guess, embedded for the remainder of the year? And then how should we think about your ability to take incremental price in 2023? And are you seeing any pushback there from customers? Thanks. Brian McKeon : Thanks for your question, Erin. Our price realization is very much in line with what we shared at Investor Day. So we had roughly 4% price realization coming out of the second quarter. We're advantaging some additional price increases in the second half. As I mentioned, globally, we were in the 5% to 6% range. In Q3, it was at the higher end of that for the U.S., and that's very much in line with the 5.5% to 6% year-on-year benefit that was implied in our -- for the second half, and that equates to 5% for the full year.  So as we head into 2023, we will have carryover benefits from the pricing that we've achieved this year, including the second half initiatives. Our plan is to have a normally timed price increase. So we'll have an additional increase at the beginning of the year, and we'll share more details on that as we roll that out, but that will incorporate the conditions that we're seeing in terms of the value that we're adding and also inflationary impacts in the business. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, I would just add to that, that from a customer perspective, what customers are most interested in and the message we keep hearing back from them, is they want to make sure that from a product testing continuity standpoint, supply chain, how we support them that all those pieces are in place. And they realize that, given the current environment, it's a little bit more expensive to run the business, and they want us to invest in being able to support them. And we see that reflected in very high customer retention rates really globally across the world. We think that's an important input or input into the growth formula of the company. So that's an area we're going to continue to invest in. And as Brian indicated, we think our pricing approach on balance, very reasonable, given the current environment. Erin Wright : Okay. Thanks. And then on 2023, the FX dynamics here are understandable given the environment that we're in. But how are you thinking about CAG recurring organic growth in 2023, just given the price realization that you are seeing and the ability to kind of assume a more potentially stable vet clinic growth as you kind of lap some of the labor dynamics assuming that those don't get forced but don't get better either? I guess, is high single-digit CAG recurring growth the right way to think about 2023? Or what are some of those dynamics as we think about the headwinds and tailwinds into 2023? Thanks. Brian McKeon : I think that we'll share more on that, obviously, as we get further along here. You're pointing out some positive factors that I think will be helpful for us heading into next year. I think the price realization is higher than we've achieved historically. We think it's appropriate in the current environment, and that will be a positive dynamic. And as Jay mentioned, we do think we'll work through some of the headwinds related to the capacity pullback that we saw this year. I think it's early for us to talk about the trajectory into next year, just given the macro backdrops. We'll gain more insight here and focus on what we can do, which is to execute well, and we think that will position us for continued solid growth, and we'll share more of those details as we complete our plans and give you an update on the year-end call. Jay Mazelsky : I think what's -- just to add to Brian's comments, what's been very gratifying is the resonance and, I think, interest amongst our customers of our solutions. I talked about software. But our customers pretty much across the board are feeling pressures. There may be capacity pressures or and or staff pressures within their practices and trying to run a business, delivering excellent medical care but also sensitive to the economics and making sure they have a healthy business.  And they're looking to software solutions. So we see this with our PIMs solutions, cloud-based PIMS solutions and their enthusiasm around really upgrading software within their practices that help support workflow optimization, staff productivity, client communications, all the things that they've been looking for. So I think we have the right solutions at the right time given the market circumstances. We're seeing that in clinic pretty much across the board, across all the solutions. And even at our Reference Lab, had really nice mouth, especially in the U.S. As we look -- we've expanded our menu. We've improved our service offerings in the case of PCR at Louisville, which is next day, if customers would like that. And they're using that as an extension of their own practice. So we're optimistic that, for those things that we can control, we'll do a good job and that customers are highly enthusiastic about these solutions. Erin Wright : Okay, great. Thank you, Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Jon Block of Stifel. Please go ahead. Jon Block : Thanks, guys. Good morning. I'll start with clinical visits. They were down 2.4% year-over-year, but it looks like wellness performed a bit better than Emergent and that just seems at odds with just capacity issues in the U.S. which would -- I'm thinking would be more acute on the wellness side of the equation. So can you guys just talk about what you're seeing out there and why this is weighing more on and why we're not seeing sort of the capacity issues hit emergent more, right? Why is the wellness performing better?  And then just maybe your thoughts, is this just also a return to work dynamic, right, people going back to work maybe noticing less things about their dog or cat, and that's just crimping the emergent volume a bit around the edges? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. Jon, on balance, I mean, on balance, there is some variability within any given quarter. But if you look at over a two-three year CAGR rate there, it's pretty -- it's what you would -- might expect. So I don't think there's anything specifically related to capacity. The capacity speaks to the length in getting an appointment. And with existing pet owners, most veterinarians aren't turning those folks away whether it's a wellness visit or a sick visit. So you wouldn't necessarily expect to see any dynamic related that piece of it. We know that people are going back to work, at least in a hybrid fashion. We haven't been able to pull out anything specifically related to return to work, whether it's two or three days a year. What we do see is capacity pullback, especially on weekends, has gone down somewhat over the year, and we think that just reflects practices or maybe short of staff and trying to balance their working environment better, better for their employees. But nothing specific that I think we can call out or point to. Jon Block : Okay. I guess I could just follow up with you offline for more color there. Just to move on, I think I have some of these numbers correct, but you mentioned the 4,700 and change premium instruments. I think that was up 10% year-over-year, but the vet instrument revenue was down 5% organic, if I've got that correct. So a lot of those premium instruments are the relatively new ProCyte One, which I think would have a solid ASP. Can you just talk about the discrepancy between, call it, the premium placement instruments, the growth, I think, again, up 10%, the organic instruments down 5% and then what that delta means? Are you getting just a little bit more aggressive in terms of some of the selling programs, maybe that's an IDEXX 360 and the trade-off there sort of in return for longer-term commitments from some of those customers? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, Jon, it's primarily related to both geographic mix. We're selling more internationally and then product mix more ProCyte Ones, which have a lower AUP than the ProCyte Dx. So the ProCyte One grew 26%. It's a lower AUP. The international mix was higher. And so that -- I think that accounts for the 5% drop in revenue on a very, very strong placement rate. Jon Block : That accounts for the 1,500 basis point delta between up 10% and down 5%, no selling programs have evolved? Brian McKeon : There are impacts from selling programs as well. I think we feel very good about the expansion of 360. We've seen very high attach rates of replacing ProCyte Ones. We're replacing Catalysts, and that's really the multiplier benefit that we've had to highlight and that gets folded into the 360-type agreement. So that's part of the dynamic as well. But largely, it's the factors that Jay was highlighting. The bulk of our growth is in international markets, and that's a meaningful driver of some of the relative revenue changes.  And -- but on balance, the overall growth in our base is very strong. Our EVI metrics were up at high levels. Consumable gains are strong. The instrument base expansion is a big driver of our execution growth benefit. So we feel really good about the instrument performance. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. One driver, we focus on from just the quality of instrument replacements is new and competitive Catalyst because that drives an outsized portion of the consumables revenue and the clinic business, and that was up 13%. And so that's a reflection of just, I think, the focus of our commercial organization and the importance of chemistry consumables to the business. Jon Block : Good color. Thanks, guys. Jay Mazelsky : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Rich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. I wanted to follow up on the price realization. I guess, how are you thinking about customer sensitivity to price increases in this market? I guess given the 1,300 basis point normalized spread that you referenced, it doesn't appear to have had an impact on volumes. But could you maybe just elaborate on any potential impacts on demand that you might see as we move forward? Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. Thanks, Nate. And good morning. Our customers, I think, see this -- see our pricing as reasonable given the current environment. They know it's more expensive for them to run their businesses. I think they see -- continue to see really good end customer demand within the clinics. And their focus is really on they want to make sure they get the support from a product continuity, testing results on time, the engagement that we provide with the customer technical support organization. So their primary focus is on that. Pricing -- the flip side of pricing is the value that we deliver, and we continue to deliver extremely high value. We've had eight product introductions or enhancements this year, just five in Q3 alone, really across the business in software, reference labs and our clinic businesses. And so that helps them from both the standpoint of delivering better patient care but also productivity and efficiency within the practice, and I appreciate that. And from the standpoint of their own -- they have the ability from an end customer pet owner pricing standpoint to increase prices. They've done that. I think diagnostics is a small piece of their overall cost envelope, but it drives the important health care services envelope for their practice. So they see this as a really core enabler to what they do. Nathan Rich : Thanks. And for my follow-up, I wanted to ask on the 4Q CAG Dx guidance. Brian, I think you had said 5% to 10%. Could you maybe just talk about what factors would put you at the high end versus low end of that range? And the midpoint is about 100 basis below what you did this quarter. I was a little surprised just given -- I know you faced a tougher compare, but I'd assume there's maybe some incremental price realization. So could you maybe just talk about your expectations for 4Q in a little bit more detail? Brian McKeon : Yeah. Thanks, Nate. We thought it was appropriate to maintain a similar outlook to what we had shared for the second half. I think we're very pleased with our third quarter execution and performance. I think on the clinic visit growth trend side, I think that, that was a relatively favorable factor in Q3, but we're not -- that as kind of a longer-term trend. We think the trends that we've seen kind of in the last few months are appropriate kind of to plan off of, and our pricing execution is in line with our plans. So we thought the -- we really focus on the midpoint of the range. We think that's still an appropriate place to be. The lower end of the range is really reflective of potential macro risk that we think is appropriate to build in. And of course, the higher end would be if we can continue to execute well and see some improvement in the underlying visit trends. But I think the -- we think, on balance, it's a consistent outlook, and we think that's appropriate in the current environment. Nathan Rich : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Westerberg of Piper. Please go ahead. David Westenberg : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. So I want to talk about the percent of your platform that might be using learned staff versus unlearned staff and is there a means of kind of using your sales force to accelerate training of these kind of programs while we're in a supply or veterinarian supply constraint environment and vet techs? And then just as kind of a follow-up to that, can you help us reconcile the constraints in labor with kind of easing them into new platforms?  So if we are in an environment where they can't really fully capture all the clientele, do they have capacity to, say, try new cornerstone or try new platforms? And that's all the questions I have. Thank you. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. Good morning. We have a multifaceted strategy to really support the efficiency. Within practices, I mentioned the portfolio piece, including software. And to answer a part of your question directly, practices are taking the time to implement new PIMS systems, specifically ezyVet. They see a really good return on that -- and they're enthusiastic about moving to the cloud-based systems and, in some cases, modifying or optimizing workflow if it helps them. Specifically around the questions around training, we have a number of different platforms to be able to support the training needs and knowledge needs, practices. Some of it is clinical, some of it is business and workflow optimization, both online and in person. We have a very significantly sized field service representative organization as well as professional service vets for more peer-to-peer that's both in person into our internal medicine group over the phone. We've seen nice growth in engagement and calls into IDEXX to help support them. So there's lots of, I think, avenues open to customers for training and practice efficiency support. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Daniels of William Blair. Please go ahead. Ryan Daniels : Yeah, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Obviously, rightfully, a lot of airtime on the CAG business, but I'm hoping you could go into a bit of color on the Water and LPG in particular, kind of what the growth outlook is there if we continue to see macro headwinds, both in the U.S. How recurring is that versus somewhat sensitive to the consumer overall macro environment? Thanks. Brian McKeon : Thanks for your question, Ryan. Let me start with the Water business. The Water business is probably our highest recurring revenue business in terms of our customer relationships. It's very much embedded with the ongoing workflow for water safety testing, and we feel very good about the momentum in that business, as we reported 12% organic growth in the quarter.  And so I think the backdrop there is it's a strong global growth, good growth across regions. We have solid net price realization as well. And we highlighted an acquisition this quarter, which complements our product offering. And so we feel very good about the momentum in that business, building off the progress that we've made recently. LPD, as we reported, had positive growth, 7% in the quarter. We were -- have worked through the tough compares that we've been facing in recent quarters in China. And actually, we're up against really an easy compare last year in China. It was probably our toughest quarter in the year. So we've worked through that, and we saw a positive benefit from health screen as a driver. And overall, kind of modest growth, mode growth in our testing areas. I think it is an area that we're paying attention to in terms of macro backdrop. But I think we've worked through the tougher compares here and feel that we're positioned for positive growth moving forward. Ryan Daniels : Okay. Perfect. And then my follow-up, a little bit different. Just the Preventive Care program obviously continues to roll out nicely. Can you remind us the status of that oU.S.? And given the investments you've made oU.S., is there a potential to push that more and try to make that even more recurring in the face of a potentially weak oU.S. macro environment? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. Thanks, Brian. We definitely are expanding Preventive Care beyond the U.S. We see a select number of markets and especially corporate accounts outside the U.S. very interested in preventive care. It's a little bit earlier stages from the standpoint of interest and adoption in some of our international country regions. But the same -- I think that's the same level of interest. It just may not be as much knowledge in terms of -- from a workflow standpoint and customer education work. That still needs to be done.  So we're making -- I think we're making progress. I would just say it's more embryonic and we think represents a solid long-term opportunity. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Elliot Wilbur : Thanks, good morning. I want to go back to the subject matter of clinical visit trends and thinking about the sequential improvement down 3.1% in the second quarter, improving to down 2.4% in 3Q. Just wondering if you could comment on the cadence of improvement over the course of the quarter, whether or not the full quarter rate is indicative of the actual exit rate. And then as a follow-up, and thinking about the trend in clinic visit trends, despite the continued declines over the last couple of quarters, it's been offset by relatively favorable diagnostic frequency per visit metric, which has been up 100 basis points the last two quarters, and I think that compares to positive 50 basis points in 1Q and longer-term average of 50 basis points.  I'm wondering if you think that, that relatively higher Dx frequency per visit metric is sustainable if, in fact, we see clinic visit trends revert to positive trends in early 2023, just sort of getting into the idea that maybe the decline in putting visit trends is more related to sort of the loss of pet owners who have perhaps a little bit more or less propensity to spend. So maybe a little bit lower quality customer has sort of been lost and that is reflected in kind of that more favorable Dx frequency number. Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. Good morning, Elliot. There are a couple of different, I think, questions you're getting at. So we saw, as you indicated, a negative 2.4% clinical visit decline in the quarter. And this was a modest sequential improvement compared to Q2. But we don't really see this as a fundamental change in the trend. We continue to expect near term impacts from reductions in capacity. And obviously, the macro environment remains dynamic. We are pleased, as we've talked about, the overall diagnostics revenue per practice visit. That's both a function of adoption as well as utilization. Those two pieces, I think, are performing extremely well through the first three quarters of this year relative to historical rates. And that's, I think, the reflection -- again, getting back to the execution drivers in the business, really driving commercial engagement and innovations, the type of things that I think customers want and that supports medical services within the practice and things that are important to really delivering exceptional patient care. And so with that, that will conclude the Q&A portion of the call. I'd like to thank everybody on the phone for their participation this morning. I know we have lots of IDEXX employees listening, and I'd like to say thank you for your continued commitment to our purpose and your focus and execution against our strategy. Your continued engagement in the midst of what we all know is dynamic external factors, I think, helped deliver another excellent quarter and excellent execution. So I'm thankful for all your work, and look forward to finishing 2022 on a strong note.  And so with that, we'll conclude the call. And again, thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. In reviewing our fourth quarter 2022 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2021, unless otherwise noted. To allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit their questions to one, with one follow-up as necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue and if time permits, we will take your additional questions. Today's prepared remarks will be posted to IDEXX.com. Investors after the earnings conference call concludes. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results and to provide an overview of our financial outlook for 2023. IDEXX had a strong finish to 2022, reflected in our fourth quarter performance. Revenues increased 7% organically, driven by 8% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues and continued strong growth in our software and water businesses. Operating profits increased 14% as reported and 17% on a comparable basis, benefiting from solid gross margin gains and OpEx leverage. Combined, these factors enabled delivery of $2.05 in EPS, up 14% on a comparable basis. IDEXX execution drivers supported delivery of full year financial results at the high end of our updated guidance range. This performance is reflected in a 1,200 basis point U.S. CAG recurring revenue growth premium to U.S. clinical visits in the second half of 2022, driven by a solid volume growth premium and higher levels of price realization. We sustained record high customer retention levels and solid new business gains globally and achieved a record level of annual CAG premium instrument placements, which drove a 13% year-on-year expansion of our global premium instrument base. Effective P&L management supported sustained full year comparable operating margins adjusted for discrete R&D costs aligned with our updated 2022 goals. These performance trends position us well as we enter 2023, and advance our growth strategy. This year, we're targeting a return to 10% organic revenue growth at the high end of our initial guidance range. This outlook is supported by continued strong IDEXX execution and net price benefits captured in our goals for double-digit CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains across our U.S. and international regions. We're also targeting solid comparable operating margin gains, building on the higher profit levels we achieved through the pandemic. We'll walk through the details of our financial guidance later in my comments. We'll highlight the building blocks of our growth outlook and discuss how we're factoring in expectations for overall sector trends and potential macro impacts into our planning. We'll also review estimates for effects from FX and interest rate changes on our reported results in 2023. Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 7% was supported by solid organic gains across our major business segments, including 8% organic growth in our CAG business, 10% organic growth in water and 6% organic growth in LPD revenues. PAG diagnostic recurring revenues increased 8% organically in Q4 compared to 13% prior year growth levels reflecting 9% gains in the U.S. and 6% growth in international regions. On a two- and three-year basis, Q4 results were in line with strong Q3 performance. We achieved continued double-digit organic revenue growth benefits from key execution drivers, including expansion of our premium instrument base, solid new business gains, sustained high customer retention levels and expansion of diagnostics revenue per visit, including benefits from higher price realization. Overall organic revenue gains were also supported by 17% growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues. CAG instrument revenue was down modestly, reflecting placement mix and comparisons to high prior year placement levels. In terms of CAG sector demand drivers, we estimate same-store diagnostics revenue in U.S. veterinary practices increased 7% in Q4. These gains continue to be supported by expansion of diagnostic test frequency and utilization. Reflected in a nearly 10% increase in diagnostics revenue per clinical visit that included diagnostics. Clinical visit levels declined 2.8% in the quarter with consistent growth trends across wellness and non-wellness categories. As we continue to work through impacts from reductions in vet clinic capacity from peak levels and lapped a significant step-up in demand we saw in 2021 and including benefits from new patient growth. IDEXX's U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth of 9% in Q4 continues to outpace sector growth trends. IDEXX' U.S. performance was supported by a 1,200 basis point growth benefit from IDEXX execution drivers, including approximately 7% net price gains and continued solid growth contributions from customer additions and leverage of IDEXX innovation. IDEXX achieved solid organic gains across our testing modalities in the fourth quarter. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 9% organically, reflecting solid gains across U.S. and international regions compared to strong prior year growth levels. Consumable gains were supported by a 13% increase in our global premium installed base in 2022, reflecting double-digit gains across our catalyst, premium hematology and SediVue platforms. We placed 5,065 premium instruments in Q4, down modestly from high prior year levels. The quality of placements continues to be excellent, reflected in 3% global gains in new and competitive Catalyst placements, including 7% gains in the U.S. We also saw a 5% growth in new and competitive premium hematology placements globally leveraging strong customer interest in ProCyte One. Rapid Assay revenue grew 9% organically, supported by benefits from net price increases and solid volume gains in the U.S. Global Lab revenues expanded 8% organically, reflecting high single-digit gains in the U.S., which were impacted to a degree by holiday week weather impacts and improved organic growth in international regions. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue results were supported by a relatively higher levels of net price realization, including benefits from our second half price initiatives. We estimate net price changes contributed approximately 7% to worldwide CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q4, reflecting product and service enhancements and coverage of inflationary impacts. As we'll discuss, we've incorporated an expectation for a 7% to 8% global net price growth benefit for the full year in 2023 and building and effects from annual list price changes, which were communicated recently to our customers. In other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 17% organically in Q4. Results were supported by continued strong growth in recurring revenues and ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. For the full year 2022, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues reached $251 million up 15% organically and 22% as reported. This includes benefits from the ezyVet acquisition, which continues to track above our acquisition model projections. Turning to our other business segments. Water revenues increased 10% organically in Q4 and for the full year 2022, reflecting strong performance across our major regions, including benefits from net price improvement and volume gains. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues increased 6% organically in Q4. Results benefited from growth in herd health screening, shipment timing and improved performance in China where we work through comparisons to high prior year levels for African swine fever and core wine testing. Turning to the P&L. We achieved strong operating profit and comparable operating margin gains in the fourth quarter. Operating profits increased 14% as reported and 17% on a comparable basis, driven by gross profit gains and OpEx leverage. Gross profit increased 6% as reported and 10% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 58.5%, up 110 basis points on a comparable basis. Net price gains, higher software service gross margins, lab productivity gains and comparisons to higher prior year investment levels and business mix all contributed positively, offsetting inflationary cost effects. Operating expenses were flat as reported and up 4% on a comparable basis in the quarter. We benefited from investment prioritization and leverage from our prior commercial expansions as well as favorable comparisons to higher prior year OpEx levels related to incentive compensation accruals, the ezyVet acquisition and specific R&D investments. For the full year 2022, operating margins were 26.7%, supported by strong second half gains. On a comparable basis, full year operating margins declined 240 basis points, driven by 230 basis points of impact from discrete R&D investments. Q4 EPS was $2.05 per share, up 14% on a comparable basis. Fourth quarter EPS results reflected $0.05 in tax benefits from share-based compensation activity and $0.07 in headwind from foreign exchange changes net of $9 million in Q4 hedge gains. Full year EPS was $8.03, a decline of 1% on a comparable basis, net of approximately 9% of EPS growth impact from discrete R&D investments. For the full year stock-based compensation activity provided $13 million or $0.15 per share in tax benefit, lowering our effective tax rate by 150 basis points. Foreign exchange reduced Q4 and full year revenue growth by approximately 4% and 3%, respectively. For the full year, foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $25 million and EPS by $0.22 per share net of foreign exchange hedge gains of $26 million. Foreign exchange trends have improved significantly since our last call update, resulting in relatively lower projected financial impacts in 2023, which we've captured in our outlook. Free cash flow was $394 million for 2022 or approximately 58% of net income, net of $149 million in capital spending. This performance reflects 25% to 30% of free cash flow conversion impact this year from discrete R&D investments, higher inventory levels aligned with sustaining product availability, higher deferred R&D tax credits and investments in a major facility expansion. Free cash flow conversion came in modestly below our guidance outlook of 60% to 65%, reflecting higher than forecast year-end working capital levels, including impacts from timing. We're targeting improvement in inventory levels in 2023, which is reflected in our outlook for 80% to 90% and free cash flow conversion this year. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended 2022 with leverage ratios of 1.3x gross and 1.2x net of cash. Our 2023 interest expense outlook incorporates current forward interest rates and expectations for a modestly lower net leverage ratio this year. We allocated $68 million to repurchase 199,000 shares in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2022, we allocated $811 million to repurchase approximately 2 million shares. Effects from share repurchase support our projected 1% to 1.5% reduction in diluted shares outstanding for the full year 2023. Turning to our 2023 full year outlook, we're providing initial guidance for reported revenues of $3.590 billion to $3.690 billion. On an organic basis, which reflects a range of 7% to 10% growth overall and 8.5% to 11% growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Our 10% overall organic growth high-end outlook is aligned with our long-term goals and reflects targets for 11.5% CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains in the U.S. and 10% growth in international regions. These targets incorporate a continued high-growth premium from IDEXX execution drivers, including growth benefits from our expanded global premium instrument installed base, new customer gains and increases in testing utilization supported by IDEXX innovation. Our high-end outlook also incorporates expectations for a relative flattening of clinical visit growth trends in the U.S. as we work through 2023. As noted, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains will be supported by an estimated 7% to 8% full year growth benefit from net price realization with expectations for 8% to 9% global net price gains in H1 and 6% to 7% net price benefit in H2. In addition to benefits from solid CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth, our overall growth outlook reflects goals for continued strong growth in our veterinary software and water businesses. We expect these gains will be moderated by flat to modest organic growth at LPD revenues in 2023 and reflecting current macro trends and approximately $10 million of impact from lower human COVID testing revenues. The low end of our overall organic growth outlook of 7% incorporates potential risks to our targeted growth goals, including effects from macroeconomic conditions. Terms of reported revenue, we now estimate foreign exchange will reduce full year revenue growth by approximately 0.5% at the rates assumed in our press release. FX revenue growth headwinds are projected to be approximately 3% in Q1 with relative improvement in the second half of the year. In terms of sensitivities to changes to the FX rates assumed in our press release, we projected a 1% change in the value of the U.S. dollar would impact full year reported revenue by approximately $12 million and operating income by approximately $3 million to $4 million, net of currently established hedge positions. Our reported operating margin outlook for the full year 2023 is 29.0% to 29.6%. At the high end, this reflects an outlook for approximately 340 basis points in comparable annual operating margin expansion, including approximately 230 basis points of benefit from lapping discrete R&D investments in 2022. We're planning for constrained gross margin gains on a comparable basis in 2023 as benefits from pricing and lab productivity initiatives helped to offset product and labor inflationary cost impacts including effects on steps we've taken to ensure high levels of supply chain and service continuity. We estimate foreign exchange will reduce full year reported operating margins by approximately 50 basis points driven by the lapping of the $26 million in 2022 hedge gains. Our 2023 EPS outlook is $9.27 per share to $9.75 per share, an increase of 16% to 21% as reported and 19% to 26% on a comparable basis, including approximately 10% of the EPS growth benefit from the lapping of discrete R&D investments. We estimate that foreign exchange will reduce full year EPS by approximately $0.23 per share at the rates assumed in our press release, with the bulk of this impact in the first half. We also expect the impacts in 2023 from higher interest expense of approximately $0.11 per share compared to 2022. Our EPS outlook factors in a 1% increase in our overall effective tax rate to 22% in 2023 reflecting lower projected benefits from share-based compensation activity. Our free cash flow outlook is for net income to free cash flow conversion ratio of 80% to 90%. This reflects estimated capital spending of approximately $180 million or approximately 5% of revenues including approximately $35 million of spending or about 5% of free cash flow conversion impact related to the completion of our major facility expansion. Overall, we're well positioned to deliver strong financial performance in 2023. In terms of our operational outlook for Q1, we're planning for overall organic revenue growth closer to the midpoint of our full year guidance range as we continue to work through some effects from relatively higher prior year clinic capacity comparisons and macro impacts on demand in international regions. In terms of our profit outlook, we're planning for a 50 to 100 basis point year-on-year improvement in reported operating margins in Q1. This includes benefits from a customer contract resolution payment of $16 million received in Q1 that will be recorded as an offset to operating expense as well as expectations for foreign exchange impacts and relatively higher OpEx growth in the first quarter related to specific factors such as the return of in-person sales meetings this year. That concludes our financial review. I will now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Jay Mazelsky : Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX delivered excellent results in the fourth quarter, reflecting sustained high levels of execution of our growth strategy. Demand for veterinary services remained strong, resulting in increased diagnostic frequency and utilization per clinical visit, building on accelerated gains achieved through the pandemic. To address this strong demand, Veterinarians look to IDEXX as their preferred partner in diagnostics and software, which supported high levels of care and helped drive our solid growth results for the fourth quarter and full year. For Q4 in the full year 2022, we achieved 8% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues supported by double-digit contribution and growth from IDEXX execution drivers. This strong performance is reflected in record full year placements for both CAG diagnostics premium instruments and software practice information management systems, continued solid contribution from new business gains, sustained high customer retention rates and net price realization aligned with our expectations. These execution growth drivers helped to offset impacts from adjustments in vet clinic capacity following a period of extraordinary growth during the pandemic as well as macro impacts, which globally pressured clinical visit levels in 2022. IDEXX's ability to deliver solid organic growth with underlying strong performance in operational metrics demonstrates the attractiveness and durability of our business as well as the outstanding work by teams across our organization to deliver results every day. Our decade-long strategic focus on diagnostic sector development, including building strong commercial engagement and innovating to expand adoption of technologies that integrate diagnostics and information management position us to build on this momentum. This morning, I'll highlight how IDEXX advanced our commercial and innovation priorities in 2022 while delivering strong financial results. I'll also discuss our areas of focus for 2023 that build on this progress. Let's start with an update on our commercial execution. High levels of execution by IDEXX commercial teams who are trusted adviser to our customers continue to drive revenue gains above sector growth levels. These teams delivered fourth quarter global premium instrument placement levels that were the second highest for any quarter in company history, supporting 13% growth in our global premium instrument installed base and contributing to record annual premium instrument placements for the full year 2022. IDEXX is highly accurate and easy to use in-clinic platforms allow clinicians to gain the deeper diagnostic insights necessary to delivering high levels of pet health care. These platforms are highly integrated into practice workflow, giving customers the tools necessary to meet higher levels of demand for pet health care services. The strong placement performance throughout 2022 highlights how IDEXX has been able to support veterinarians during this past year, capacity constraints in a highly effective way. Not only was the magnitude of placements impressive, but they were also at very high quality. This is reflected in strong growth for Catalyst and premium hematology placements at new and competitive accounts globally. These gains demonstrate strong clinical interest in IDEXX's products and a compelling value proposition that our multimodality strategy and customer-friendly marketing programs provide to veterinarians. New and competitive placements helped drive U.S. revenue contribution from new business in the fourth quarter above historic levels, which is an encouraging signal for future growth as this new business will drive future recurring revenue flow-through supported by very high customer retention models. Customer retention rates remained at or above 97% across our major modalities throughout 2022. And another trend that highlights the strong capabilities of our commercial organization and the value that an IDEXX relationship brings to our customers. International premium placement growth was strong as well while also reflecting high-quality placements in new and competitive accounts, which supported solid net customer gains across modalities. This is a result of our global commercial teams increased leverage of our successful BDC model, which encourages a laser focus on engaging with veterinarians, educating them on the value of diagnostics in the way IDEXX can support their needs and ultimately building a loyal installed base, a key driver of our international growth opportunity. Installed base growth was supported by double-digit Catalyst placement growth in European countries where we have completed expansions since 2021. Commercial expansion is a key component of our international strategy, along with an optimized reference lab network and software tools like VetConnect PLUS. These results highlight our progress executing against that strategy. Moving forward, we look forward to building on these initiatives to address the two-thirds of our global TAM represented by international regions. The clinical and economic benefits of growing our installed base of premium instruments on CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue are notable. Let's take an example of Catalyst, our chemistry analyzer and our Catalyst SDMA slide or SDMA in combination with total T4. In 2022, customers ran and paid for over 5 million SDMA slides on a global basis and well over 40,000 clinics supported by VetConnect PLUS and IDEXX DecisionIQ. These are customers who have decided that SDMA and early biomarker for kidney impairment is a clinically important parameter in a wide variety of use cases. It's a great example of IDEXX brings not just highly differentiated innovations to our customers, but then invest in creating awareness, education, adoption and ultimately, continued utilization as part of our sector development strategy. Next, an update on our software strategy and our progress in delivering an integrated solution of information management with our reference lab and point-of-care diagnostics platforms. IDEXX software and diagnostic imaging businesses continued to deliver high placement and recurring revenue growth. This business includes an end-to-end stack of software products that create a seamless connected ecosystem across the whole tech clinic, which in turn enables deeper diagnostic insights, supports pet owner communications creates workflow efficiencies and help support greater diagnostics usage and revenue growth. Customers have never had a greater need for these solutions, as capacity constraints in some instances have limited their ability to support patient demand. This is evidenced by record PIMS placements and high-teens growth in Web PACS subscribers in 2022, which helped drive a continued shift towards recurring revenue for this business. On a full year basis, software and diagnostic imaging revenues reached over $250 million, up 15% organically. As we expand our software business, our recurring revenues are growing even faster, supporting strong gains in profit contribution and also reinforcing the value of software as a stand-alone business. PIMS placements continue to be driven by customer adoption of cloud-based solutions. As we highlighted at Investor Day this past year, the cloud is gaining momentum rapidly in the veterinary software space. We are in the midst of a significant shift towards these type of products and IDEXX's software portfolio is very well positioned to address this trend towards efficient, easy-to-use cloud-based solutions. Cloud-based PIMS comprise approximately 90% of placements in 2022, delivering a durable revenue stream and significant benefits to CAG gross margins over the -- given the SaaS-based model for these products. We are on track for cloud-based PIMS to represent over 50% of our global footprint this year and expect this shift to accelerate over the rest of this decade. These results were achieved while our software team was tasked with delivering the rapid integration of the ezyVet solution into our business, a multiyear priority that is tracking well and driving revenue and profit delivery ahead of the expectations established during the acquisition process. This progress is a great example of how IDEXX consistently delivers high levels of return on invested capital by deploying resources in the right place at the right time and delivering seamless execution and integration. This not only benefits our financial performance but also drives the sector forward and puts world-class products and enhance of our customers. Our software business will continue to provide attractive, highly synergistic investment opportunities. The early success of our cloud-first strategy, anchored by ezyVet positions IDEXX well over the coming years as software and cloud data products increased in relevance and importance to veterinary clinics. In addition to this excellent software performance, strong commercial results were also supported by IDEXX's relentless focus on innovation as a key driver of diagnostics adoption and utilization. 2022 is an exciting year of innovation for IDEXX in multiple ways, starting with continued strong adoption of our ProCyte One premium hematology analyzer, which launched in 2021. The ProCyte One offers customers very high clinical performance in an efficient, lower cost and smaller footprint platform. It is critical to our efforts to address the approximately 240,000 worldwide premium instrument placement opportunity given its relevance submitting hematology first international countries and its high attach rates catalyst. Worldwide placements grew 16% for ProCyte One in the fourth quarter, elevating the installed base of this new piece of technology to more than 8,000 units. This is very strong progress against our target for 20,000 incremental premium hematology placements by 2026, and we look forward to building on this momentum to achieve our long-term goals. In terms of more recent innovation launches, we were excited to announce multiple expansions to our preventive care solutions recently at VMX. These program extensions will provide veterinarians with deeper insights and allow them to detect issues sooner and include the launch of IDEXX Nu.Q Canine Cancer Screen now available at our U.S. Reference hub network, which expands our growing oncology platform by adding a more accessible way for veterinarians to screen for a disease that impacts nearly 6 million dogs annually in the U.S. And secondly, the rollout of IDEXX Preventive Care Simple Start, formerly preventive care challenge, an improved wellness program designed for the capacity-constrained practice, which includes staff training and tools for custom diagnostic profile development and client communications. At VMX, we also shared an expansion to the menu for IDEXX DecisionIQ, formerly clinical decision support which now includes endocrine features in addition to the vector-borne disease and chronic kidney disease conditions we rolled out earlier in 2022. This software service applies intelligent insights, to patient-specific data and delivers next step considerations in VetConnect PLUs. Valuable insights would support veterinarians to swiftly and confidently move through a case. Innovation does not stop at the point of launching a new product. However, integrating new technology into practice workflows and protocols and supporting customers with our medical consulting group is an important step in driving adoption and utilization of our diagnostic solutions. We have recently seen good traction in this area with some of our products and services, which were launched in 2022. Our approved 4Dx Plus in fecal, DX antigen test with detection of flea tapeworms are now included with the Preventive Care Simple Start program we announced at VMX. Another example is FGF23. And a biomarker that helps determine dietary phosphate restriction in cats with kidney disease that is offered through our reference labs has now been integrated into updated International Renal Interest Society Guidelines. These product rollouts are critical to our long-term efforts to develop the companion animal diagnostics and information management sector. They help drive the consistent positive contribution to sector diagnostics revenue growth for both diagnostics frequency and utilization that we saw in 2022 and continued adoption of new technologies to help build off these higher levels in 2023. The relentless focus on innovation demonstrates IDEXX's commitment to developing our sector and highlights our customer-first approach, which aims to address the most pressing needs of veterinarians. In this context, diagnostics has become an integral way for veterinarians to enable the provision of medical services and to grow their practices, reflecting same-store clinical diagnostics revenue growth of 7% that is outpacing total practice and clinical revenue gains and becoming a larger contribution to practice profitability. Our customers are hungry for solutions that help them deliver a higher standard of care and help support workflow, client communications and staff productivity. An additional key element necessary to provide this enablement is product and service continuity and turnaround time. For these reasons, it is of great importance that IDEXX gives our customers confidence and reinsurance that the products and services they need, will be available when and where they need them. Our supply chain teams ensured this continuity by delivering 99% product availability and on-time delivery levels again in the fourth quarter. A standard we achieved in each quarter of 2022. This performance gives us a pride to confidently say that if and when our customers ever need our help, where they help them. And in turn, our customers reward us with high retention levels and world-class NPS scores for our products and services. This customer-first mindset is fundamental to our strategy and we look forward to bringing it to our work on a daily basis in 2023. That concludes our prepared remarks. Before we transition to Q&A, I would like to recognize our nearly 11,000 IDEXX colleagues for their ongoing passion and high levels of performance, which supported solid growth in 2022 in a very dynamic external environment. Their work helps us work towards providing a better future for animals, people, our planet today, while also addressing the significant sector development opportunity ahead of us. It's an honor to report the results of this excellent execution against our strategic priorities, and it's exciting to share how IDEXX remains well positioned to deliver solid growth and financial results into the future. So on behalf of the management team, I'll say thank you to our colleagues for the enthusiasm and engagement you bring to our work every day. You are at the core of our progress we've made against our purpose to enhance the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock. With that, we'll now open the line for Q& A Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] At this time I'll take your first question from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : I guess, starting with the U.S., how are you thinking about the cadence of U.S. clinical visit growth this year? It sounds like 1Q will be similar to what you saw in the fourth quarter. And then Brian, I think you said the high end of guidance reflects a flattening of visits for the year. So could you maybe just talk about your expectation for how the year plays out? And do you envision a return to positive clinical visit growth by the back half of the year in the high end of your guidance? Brian McKeon : Thanks for your question, Nate. We are expecting that we'll still be working through some of the compares in the U.S. to the pullback in capacity that kind of happened through the first half of last year. And so you're correct. I think that's something we're acknowledging in the Q1 outlook. We'll still be working through that as well as some of the macro impacts internationally. We -- the guidance that we provided, as you pointed out, the higher end does for the U.S. assume that we see a flattening of the trend and that's meant to imply in the back half of the year. And so that would assume a relative level of improvement, but is not projecting growth. I think Jay can talk a bit more to that, but I think that that's an appropriate assumption we feel with the changes that we've been working through. Jay Mazelsky : Good morning, Nate. Yes. I would just qualitatively add that what we see from a market standpoint and customer standpoint, is the -- they made good progress in working through some of the capacity constraints they're not all working at the same pace. We've seen a bolus of practices who have adjusted care workflows, added staff particularly licensed veterinarians per overall veterinarian. So, the mix is more towards staff, and they've been able to increase productivity in that sense. So, I think just as we forecasted, it's taken time but I think the profession is making the progress. They're investing in technology. We've seen that with the purchase and inflation of our in-clinic laboratory software solutions particularly cloud-based software solutions is something that veterinarians are looking to as a way of supporting staff productivity, client communications, just overall workflow optimization within the practice. Nathan Rich : Okay, great. And maybe just to follow up on that. Obviously, you've talked about a higher level of net price realization expected for 2023. Could you maybe just talk about what the reactions from customers have been to the price increases that you took in 2022? And does the outlook kind of assume any impact on the level of utilization or volumes that you expect? And could you maybe also just comment on is the price realization kind of brought across the different product lines in CAG? Jay Mazelsky : Yes. So let me take the back end of your question first. It is. So this is a global approach that we've taken, and we think pricing is appropriate within the current context. I'll say from a qualitative standpoint, we see demand holding up well relative to both the back impacts in the economy as well as the different pricing scenarios we've articulated. Keep in mind that from a customer standpoint, they're highly appreciative and they value the overall IDEXX value proposition, goods and services and they recognize that on a sustained basis, we've invested and we'll continue to invest in innovation, but also the customer experience, which is critically important to them so that they can focus on providing care and don't have to worry about diagnostic service levels and just overall product continuity. The other thing that I would say is they also recognize that we have taken a technology for life type approach. If you take a look at our catalyst, our chemistry analyzer over the last decade, there have been nine parameter extensions or upgrades so that a customer who purchased. Our catalysts, chemistry analyzer today or 10 years ago would have the exact same features and functionality. And we think that's highly differentiated, not just in our industry, but really in the industry. Brian McKeon : Just reinforce to that our goals at the higher end, which is what we're shooting for as a company, we reflect sustaining the solid volume growth premium that we've been able to achieve. So, independent of the pricing benefit, how much we've been able to drive volume growth above clinical visit growth, and it reflects sustaining that strong level of performance. Operator : We'll hear next from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Just following up on the pricing one. Can you just talk at least directionally about longer-term pricing dynamics, not looking for specific numbers? But should we think about more normalized price increases as we look out to 2024 and beyond, and this is kind of like a unique window with what's happening with inflation and everything else? Or is this a -- it could be ongoing kind of trend with larger price increases? And then just a follow-up after that. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. Chris, we're not projecting beyond this year, so this is guidance for 2023. We recognize just as a pricing philosophy. We want to maintain a good balance between the value we deliver, the price of our testing services. Keep in mind also that veterinary practices that the diagnostics is a core neighbor medical services within the practice. It's a large profit center for them. They typically mark it up. But having said that, we want to make sure we don't get in front of where the value is. And we're taking a very long-term approach to developing the overall sector. So and you've seen that historically. And the way we've reported it, I think the difference in 2022 and 2023 as inflation and the macroeconomic cost impacts of running the business. Chris Schott : Great and then just -- can you just elaborate a little bit more on your outlook for Europe? I guess how much of a macro headwind that you're seeing in these markets? And maybe just talk a little bit about how you see those headwinds playing out as we move through 2023? Brian McKeon : Yes. So, our goal is -- we came out of the second half of the year with about 6% CAG diagnostic recurring growth. Our goal is at the higher end for next year or 10%. And so, that's obviously an improvement. This year it's tougher to calibrate. We don't have the same clinic level data granularity, but I think the same-store sales headwinds in places like Europe are probably in the mid-single-digit range. So, it's softer than the U.S. and so consistent with what we're doing in our U.S. business, we're targeting sustained execution driver leverage. So, getting -- growing faster than the same store sales at the clinic visit growth levels, and we are building in some expectation for less of a headwind but still some headwinds. And I think that's appropriate just given the macro backdrop that our international markets are still working through, but we are targeting double-digit growth. We've got the pricing benefits that Jay highlighted to help support that and still feel very optimistic about the long-term potential in our international regions. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. Let me pick up on that of the long-term potential. We see two-thirds of the future TAM outside our U.S. geography. And so that's something that we've invested in. Over time, we've had seven expansions, commercial expansions over the last few years. Currently, there's some macro headwinds as Brian described them, but I think the opportunity is very significant over time and we're approaching it in a similar way that we've approached our sector development in the U.S., which is through innovation, through engagement with our commercial model as partners and really helping create awareness and education and ultimately, adoption. So, we're very optimistic over the longer term. We think also, I would just highlight the role that ProCyte One has played in our international geography. It's a very compelling solution. Our customers, it fits from a performance profile, cost standpoint. Many of these markets are hematology first markets, and we're seeing very nice uptake, and we expect, as we've laid out at Investor Day, that 20,000 premium hematology placements over the planning horizon. Operator : We'll hear next from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Erin Wright : Great. Does your guidance for 2023 assume any sort of contribution from the two new platforms that you plan to launch here, hopefully, in the near future? And how should we think about those? Are they more of a 2024 event? And how should we also just be thinking about the timing of magnitude in terms of the contribution from the innovation pipeline? Jay Mazelsky : Yes. No, we haven't provided any specifics on the two new point-of-care platforms. And as we get closer to launch, we'll talk about this. Brian McKeon : Yes. They're not in the there's nothing related to those platforms in the guidance. Erin Wright : Okay. So -- and then. Brian McKeon : Other than the cost to support continuing. Erin Wright : Okay, great. And on the cost side, I guess, 7% to 8% price realization obviously tracking above historical. And I think Brian, you talked about some of this in your prepared remarks, but what are some of those key factors that we should be kind of aware of that are limiting the full drop through from a pricing perspective to the bottom line? Brian McKeon : The inflationary costs are real. On the product cost front, took a number of steps this year to ensure that we have high product availability and it's been a challenging kind of environment to manage the supply chain dynamics. Our operational team has done a fantastic job on that front, but we did make choices to ensure we've got supply, and that's going to be flowing through in our product costs for a period of time, and there are higher labor costs as well. I think we're the price increases that we advanced, I think reflected in our margin outlook where appropriate, given some of the dynamics that we're working through. And we're able to improve gross margins through initiatives like productivity activity and our initiatives in our lab operations and just continued focus on growing our recurring revenues at a strong rate. But the -- on the gross margin front, that's the primary impact. And I think we're always trying to be balanced with our base of overall investment and that's allowing us to deliver solid margin improvement overall at the higher end of our guidance range. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. I would also add, just on the commercial front, we're back to more of a normal type operational cadence. We attended the VMX and VMX was the biggest show in its history. We've had sales summits from a customer visit standpoint, our field organization is -- the majority of visits are now in person. So it's much more of a pre- pandemic type operational cadence. Operator : Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Ryskin : Great. Brian, I think in your earlier comments, you talked a little bit about the IDEXX premium, the bridge between the underlying vet visit volume and price and then your actual revenue growth. I think you said that the high end of the guide assumes a similar premium to what you've seen previously. Is there a lower premium at the lower end of the guide? Can you talk us through sort of what your expectations are for that between the 7% and the 10%, sort of what are you thinking in terms of the IDEXX growth premium? Brian McKeon : Right. Thanks for the question, Mike. So, just starting with the high end, let me use the U.S. So if we've got an 11.5% growth goal with 7% to 8% pricing, that's approximately implied about 4% volume growth and with some level of headwind from visits as we work through the first half of the year. That gets us to go to the volume growth premium that we've been delivering and kind of consistent with pre-pandemic trends. So that's how we're thinking about it. We have a range which we think is appropriate to calibrate for risks to that outlook, primarily macroeconomic impacts and, you know, so I think that's not linked to one specific factor, but I think it's something that we think is prudent, is the way we plan the business to make sure that we have financial plans where we can deliver solid profit gains, if things don't all go the way that we anticipate. And so again, it's not linked to one specific factor, but it builds in potential macro headwinds or if things don't recover the way that we're targeting in terms of the clinical visit trends. Michael Ryskin : Okay. And then for the follow-up, we're seeing last year in 2022 and this year, some very specific product launches coming from HESKA and ABAXIS and others in the space. So, I'm wondering if you could touch on the competitive landscape just a little bit kind of tied into that previous question as well. Any changes you're seeing there? Any come conversations with customers, how that might factor into your pricing strategy? Jay Mazelsky : Yes. We've said for a long time, the diagnostics market is a very attractive market. There's a lot of competitive intensity. Nothing has changed on that front. We believe that through the customer lens that our overall solution portfolio is highly differentiated the combination of our in-clinic laboratory reference laboratory software, the connectivity of it all really helped support the practice mission. We see that if you take a look at our new and competitive placements, which we provided both for Catalyst and now for premium hematology, we're doing extremely well. We're growing our software in Web PACS and Diagnostic Imaging businesses very well. We feel very good about our focus on the customers and helping them to achieve their goals and we think it's reflected in the results. Operator : Mr. Block you have anything further or Mr. Ryskin, my apologies. Michael Ryskin : No, that's it. Thank you. Operator : We will move next to Jon Block with Stifel. Jon Block : Great. First one, Brian, maybe just a clarification. I thought you said a $16 million customer contract resolution. Was that in the first quarter of '23? I'm not sure I heard you properly. And if so, is that in the GAAP 2023 EPS guide, I'm landing at $0.15-ish to the bottom line. Maybe you can comment on that. And then last, just bolt-on. Is that an offset to OpEx, if I'm right on all these assumptions, not a rev line item, and I'll start with that clarification, please? Brian McKeon : I think you had got all that right. It is a Q1 2023 factor that we highlighted in our Q1 outlook and it is recorded as an -- it's an other income item for us which is recorded as an offset to G&A, and that's correct. Jon Block : I got it all right. I don't know if I should push it. But the 9% to 16% comparable earnings growth that you sort of have in the release once you back out the 10%, is it in that one as well? The 9% to 16% also benefits from the $0.15? Brian McKeon : Perfect. And then just maybe to follow on Mike's question, I'm just sort of coming at it a little differently. For2023 clinical visits, it sounds like you're landing around down 1% to 2% for the full year, I don't know, around there. So vals are down, 1% to 2%, and price is up 7% to 8%, and just to be clear on price -- it's 7% to 8%, right. The press release read a little funny saying like 7% to 8% was the case if you were at the high end of your range. I'm guessing prices price, maybe you guys can clarify that. Jonathan Mazelsky : Yes. That is correct. Jon Block : Okay. So price is right. So yes, there was a confusion incoming on that. So if vals are down 1% to 2% and price is up 7% to 8% if I take your 10% CAG Dx recurring you land at what we're calling 400 to 500 bps of non-price non-visit growth, which seems like an ongoing deceleration throughout sort of '22, certainly the back half of '22. And I know there's moving parts with U.S. and international, Brian, but sometimes we don't get such great granularity too. Just your thoughts on that 400 to 500 bps non-priced on visit growth the deceleration comments, and broadly speaking, is that sort of how we should view the business in the near term until maybe innovation kicks back in? Brian McKeon : Thanks, John. I was trying to follow your analytics. We focus those discussions on our U.S. numbers, just to be clear because that's where we actually have the reporting. So, the 11.5% overall growth if you use the midpoint of the pricing guide. And I do want to clarify the expected pricing benefit is something that we feel very good about across our performance range. So that is -- we were focusing on kind of the analytics around our high end to help people understand that. But going back to the high end of 11.5% CAG U.S. recurring diagnostic revenue growth, netting out the price benefit, use the midpoint that would be about 4% volume benefit. And we didn't explicitly highlight the clinical visit trend, but it bridges back to that that 5% to 6% kind of volume growth premium that we saw in the second half. That's about what we've seen pre-pandemic. And so, we're looking -- that's what we're shooting for. And all indications our execution is holding up really well. If you look at the performance of trips and just how we've consistently done, so looking to build on that momentum. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. I would just add to that, if you take a look at the execution metrics around customer retention, new customer acquisition, Brian highlighted price realization, which we think is appropriate given the current context. Overall, commercial execution has been excellent, and we anticipate being able to continue to execute well in the current year. Operator : Ryan Daniels from William Blair. Your line is open. Chris Schott : Jay, maybe a big picture one for you. I'm curious if you look back over the last year or so with the capacity constraints your practice clients are facing. Have you noticed any material changes and maybe either based on your data or conversations with your customer-facing team, in regards to how they're using diagnostics. So changing the point of care to reference lab versus on-site or maybe running larger panels, so they don't have to do reruns, just anything like that from a macro trend basis that you're seeing? Jay Mazelsky : Ryan. So, we have not -- we continue to see that customers would use one modality and diagnostics tend to use more of the other modality and vice versa. It's testing begets testing. We've seen a continuation of that trend. We've also seen wellness versus non-wellness testing hold up well. We think that that's really a function of pet owner demand. Pet owners want to be able to get the great care, whether for health, happiness, even longevity of their pet. So, they're filling into the practices and for wellness and preventive care visits. So, we continue to see that as an important aspect of developing the overall sector. We do see practices I think, to a greater extent than in previous times. I appreciate the role of their staff, retaining their staff, investing in education of their staff. I think they've gotten smarter around the use of technology in the importance of technology. We've seen that in software and the move to cloud-based PIM systems, but also the applications that that integrate and extend the capability of their PIM systems. So, we think that overall, even given the overall macro impacts that we've described, pet owner and consumer demand has held up relatively well. Michael Ryskin : Okay. And then maybe digging a little bit deeper into some of the clinical decision support, you spent more time, I think, than in the past talking about the cloud and kind of data analytics and using that data. So, can you dive a little bit more into DecisionIQ and how broad that goes in regards to informing point-of-care clinical decisions and how widely used that is from the practitioners that are using it to do next step diagnostics? Jay Mazelsky : I'd be glad to. Yes, DecisionIQ is what formerly known as clinical decision support as part of our VetConnect PLUS application. Keep in mind, just let me paint the broader context here is that the general practitioner is incredibly busy. They're responsible for this wide range of clinical and medical services and having DecisionIQ, which can support the decision-making, which can suggest the possible things that they may not have considered. And even I think to your question or point, suggest next step test, we think, is an important tool in the hands of veterinarians. We have tens of thousands of practices on a global basis, which are now using VetConnect PLUS and therefore DecisionIQ as part of their daily practice, the ability to support vector-borne disease and now endocrine is that menu will continue to be extended over time. So, it's becoming increasingly valuable in the hands of veterinarians and something that we think over time will just grow in value. But thank you for that question. That's a wrap. We're out of time. I'd like to thank everyone, and that concludes the Q&A portion of the call. I appreciate your participation this morning. So in summary, we see a significant decade-long opportunity to increase the standard of care for companion animal health care and remain committed to our consistent strategic approach to address this opportunity. Sustain high levels of performance by IDEXX teams enabled us to build on the decades-long investments in innovation, infrastructure and commercial capabilities to deliver solid growth and strong financial returns in 2022 and positions us well for 2023. And now we'll conclude the call. Thank you.",

Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the forward-looking statements noticed in our press release issued this morning, as well as in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website, idexx.com. During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures, not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. In reviewing our first quarter 2023 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth, and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2022, unless otherwise noted. [Operator Instructions]. Today's prepared remarks will be posted to the Investor Relations section of idexx.com after the earnings call concludes. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Good morning and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. IDEXX had a solid start to 2023. In terms of highlights for the quarter, overall revenues increased 10% organically, supported by nearly 12% organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains were driven by nearly 14% organic growth in the U.S. supported by solid volume gains and benefits from the higher net price realization. Key execution metrics remained strong globally reflected in record first quarter premium instrument placements, continued solid new business gains and sustained high growth in recurring veterinary software revenues. Operating profits and EPS increased 18% on a comparable basis reflecting solid organic revenue growth, better than expected gross margin gains and benefits from a $16 million customer contract resolution payment. These strong results reflect the durability and resiliency of the IDEXX business model and benefits from our ongoing focus on execution. We've incorporated our Q1 results in positive adjustments to our full-year financial outlook which we'll discuss later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our first quarter results. First quarter organic revenue growth of 10% was driven by 11% CAG gains and solid 8% growth in Water. Overall organic revenue gains were moderated by 2% declines in our LPD business and approximately $4 million of revenue headwind related to lower human COVID testing revenues, a business area that we winded down completely in Q1. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue increased 12% organically reflecting 14% gains in the U.S. and 8% growth in international regions. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth was supported by global net price gains in the 8% to 9% range, consistent with our expectations. Overall organic revenue gains were also supported by 14% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues. CAG instrument revenues were down 7% organically, reflecting comparisons to high prior year levels, program pricing effects and global mix. IDEXX CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth remained solidly above sector growth levels. In the U.S., we achieved a 1,350 basis point growth premium compared to relatively flat same-store U.S. clinical visit growth levels in Q1. These results reflected benefits from execution drivers including higher net price realization. Solid U.S. volume growth was supported by new business gains, high customer retention levels and continued increases in diagnostic frequency and utilization at the practice level. International CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue gains were also supported by strong IDEXX execution, reflected in higher net price realization, sustained new business gains and a double-digit expansion of our premium instrument installed base. Double-digit growth rate benefits from these drivers were moderated by impacts from challenging international macro conditions, which continued to pressure same-store volume growth trends in the quarter. Globally IDEXX achieved strong organic revenue growth across our modalities in Q1. IDEXX VetLab consumables revenues increased 12% organically with double-digit gains in the U.S. and international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 11% year-on-year growth on our global premium instrument installed base reflecting double-digit increases across our Catalyst, Premium Hematology and SediVue platforms. We placed 4,425 CAG premium instruments in Q1, an increase of 3% year-on-year compared to very strong prior year levels building on the record placement levels achieved in the fourth quarter of 2022. The quality of instrument placements continues to be excellent reflected 7% growth in new and competitive Catalyst placements. ProCyte One momentum also continues to be strong globally reflecting in a global installed base that more than doubled over the last year to 9,400 units. Global rapid assay revenues expanded 12% organically driven by strong growth in the U.S., reflecting solid volume gains and benefits from higher net price realization. Global lab revenues increased 11% organically reflecting strong gains in the U.S. and mid single-digit growth in international, with growth in key international regions moderated by macro-economic impacts, which have pressured same-store sales. In terms of other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 14% organically. Results were supported by continued high levels of organic growth in recurring software and digital imaging revenues, and ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. Water revenues increased 8% organically in Q1, reflecting solid gains in the U.S., Europe and Latin America, including benefits from net price improvement. The integration and performance of our recent Tecta-PDS acquisition has progressed well expanding our capabilities in Water safety testing. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue decreased 2% organically as solid gains in the U.S. and Europe were offset by comparisons to high prior year sales levels in herd health screening and reduced revenues from non-core food and safety products in certain regions. Turning to the P&L, Q1 profit results were supported by a 150 basis point improvement in reported operating margins reflecting 10% organic revenue growth, solid gross profit gains and benefits from a $16 million customer contract resolution payment. Gross profit increased 9% in the quarter as reported and 12% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 60.3% up 120 basis points on a comparable basis. Benefits from higher net price realization, lab productivity initiatives, improvement in software service gross margins and business mix offset inflationary cost effects. Later timing of lab staffing increases and select operational upsides also supported Q1 gross profit results. As expected, reported gross margin gains were moderated by a 50 basis point negative impact related to foreign exchange changes, including lapping of prior year hedge gains. Operating expenses increased 5% year-on-year as reported in the quarter and 7% on a comparable basis. This was net of a $16 million or 6% operating expense growth offset related to the customer contract resolution payment. As planned, we saw higher growth in sales & marketing and R&D expense in the quarter related to specific factors including the return of in-person sales meetings this year and advancement of key innovation initiatives. EPS was $2.55 per share in Q1, an increase of 12% as reported and 18% on a comparable basis. Foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $12 million and EPS by $0.11 per share in the quarter, including impacts from the lapping of prior year hedge gains. Free cash flow was $144 million in the first quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion ratio was 65%. For the full-year, we're maintaining our outlook for free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90%, including estimated capital spending of $180 million. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 1.1x gross and 1x net of cash down modestly from Q4 levels. Share repurchases over the last year supported a 1.9% reduction in diluted shares outstanding. We didn't allocate capital to share repurchases in the first quarter, as we manage our balance sheet relatively more conservatively in the current interest rate environment. Turning to our 2023 P&L outlook, we're refining our full-year outlook to incorporate our solid Q1 operating results and updated estimates for foreign exchange impacts. We're updating our full-year guidance for reported revenues to $3,615 million to $3,700 million, this includes a $10 million positive adjustment for foreign exchange impacts, which we now estimate will provide a relatively modest full-year headwind to reported revenue growth. Our updated outlook for overall organic revenue growth is 7.5% to 10%. Our Q1 results tracked towards the high end of this range and we're maintaining consistent high-end targets for our performance this year, reflecting benefits from execution drivers and the potential for reduced clinical visit growth headwinds. As part of our financial management approach, we incorporated risk estimates to our targeted growth performance in the low end of our organic revenue growth range, including potential effects from macro-economic conditions. We raised the low end of our full-year organic revenue growth outlook by 0.5% in our updated guidance, incorporating our solid start to the year. We're maintaining our outlook for solid operating margin performance in 2023 with an expectation for reported operating margins in the range of 29% to 29.5% for the full-year. At the high-end, this reflects an outlook for approximately 340 basis points in comparable operating margin expansion. This includes approximately 280 basis points in combined benefit from the $16 million Q1 customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of $80 million of discrete R&D investment in the second quarter of 2022. We now estimate that foreign exchange will reduce reported operating margins by approximately 60 basis points this year slightly higher than earlier projections, which included impacts from the lapping of $26 million in 2022 hedge gains. Our updated EPS outlook is $9.33 to $9.75 per share, reflecting a $0.06 per share increase in our low-end estimate. We continue to estimate that foreign exchange impacts will decrease EPS by approximately $0.23 for the full-year with the bulk of this impact in the first half. In terms of our operational outlook for Q2, we're planning for overall organic revenue growth consistent with the midpoint to higher end of our full-year growth outlook range with approximately 1% of reported growth headwind from year-on-year FX changes. In terms of Q2 operating margins, we're planning for reported operating margins in the range of 29% to 29.5%. This reflects expectations for relatively consistent operating margin performance year-on-year adjusting for about 70 basis points in negative foreign exchange impacts and benefits from comparisons to prior year results, which included $80 million in discrete R&D investment. We've provided details on our updated outlook in the press release tables and earnings snapshot. Overall, we're applying a disciplined financial approach that advances our growth strategy and mitigates potential macro risks to ensure delivery of continued strong financial performance. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Jay Mazelsky : Thank you, Brian, and good morning. I'm pleased to share that IDEXX had a very strong start to 2023, driven by sustained execution of our growth strategy. Demand for Companion Animal medical services continues to grow, supported by IDEXX innovation and direct customer engagement. Veterinarians continue to focus on meeting these high levels of demand with the best possible medical care, with diagnostics as an essential component of this care equation. IDEXX remains a chosen, trusted partner to veterinarians who appreciate how our world-class products and connected ecosystem enable high standards of care, while resulting in growth of a significant profit center within their clinics. IDEXX's strong execution is reflected in double-digit total company organic revenue growth, supported by strong expansion of global CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Growth in this recurring revenue annuity was supported by solid contribution for new business gains, sustained high customer retention rates, and net price realization aligned with our expectations. Our commercial teams drove another record quarter for global premium instrument placements and excellent levels of cloud-based software placements. IDEXX products and services offer solutions to improve clinic productivity and support the significantly expanded and underserved demand we've seen for pet healthcare in recent years including net pet additions in the U.S. of 2% in 2022, twice the pre-pandemic trend line. These efforts supported strong IDEXX growth as we continue to work effectively through the near-term sector headwinds related to clinic, capacity constraints, and global macro conditions. Today I'll discuss how IDEXX's sustained execution against our strategy to drive the adoption and utilization of diagnostics help deliver continued strong financial results. First, I'll provide an update on our commercial execution, which through education and customer engagement drives relevant utilization of IDEXX's innovative solutions. IDEXX commercial teams delivered another record first quarter global premium instrument placements to start 2023, building on very strong prior year results. Our commercial teams demonstrated a continued ability to advance placement, quantity and quality. This is reflected in strong growth in Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts globally driving solid EVI achievement. These commercial results are highly encouraging as we address the significant opportunity for an estimated 220,000 worldwide premium instrument placements and give us confidence that we have the right strategic playbook in place. IDEXX professionals provide world-class, software-enabled products that are in high demand, and supported by a wide menu of customer-friendly marketing programs that enable adoption of new technology. These results also reflect continued strong clinical interest in using IDEXX's products and services, to not only meet the increased demand for pet healthcare, but to deliver the best possible level of care. Our commercial execution is supported by the multiplier benefits that flow from IDEXX innovations as evidenced by the success of our newest hematology analyzer, ProCyte One. ProCyte One provides customers with an attractive in-clinic hematology solution, its small footprint, easy pay-per-run model, and lower cost come without sacrificing CBC performance. IDEXX premium placements have benefited from strong ProCyte One adoption to date thanks to sustained high attach rates with Catalyst, as defined by ProCyte One placements either with a Catalyst or at an existing Catalyst customer. The result is a multiplier benefit, supported by clinics who choose to outfit their in-clinic suite with IDEXX products. As a result, we are nearly halfway to the incremental 20,000 premium hematology placement objective we shared at Investor Day following ProCyte One's launch, while the strong attach rates should also help IDEXX penetrate the long-term worldwide placement opportunity. Key to developing this long-term opportunity will be increasing customer engagement in international regions. We're leveraging our successful VDC model to build strong relationships with international customers, as evidenced by sustained strong new business gains and a 19% increase in Catalyst placements. This strong performance is allowing us to deliver solid CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth in international regions, despite continued macro headwinds, which are pressured same-store clinical visit levels. Customer engagement remains excellent as evidenced by high reach to revenue levels in the first quarter, including benefits from our expanded commercial sales force in targeted regions. The flywheel is beginning to turn in these countries, where we've seen excellent gains from new business, strong interest in engaging with customer marketing programs, and solid overall volume growth. Commercial expansion is an important early step in our international strategy, supporting recent efforts to optimize our reference lab network, roll out highly relevant products like ProCyte One, and drive further adoption of software tools like VetConnect PLUS, our cloud-based diagnostic portal. Software innovation continues to be a key driver of our growth strategy globally. IDEXX software solutions are a key enabler of diagnostics utilization, creating a connected ecosystem that helps improve diagnostics workflow, while providing deeper clinical insights and supporting pet-owner communication. It's an attractive standalone business as well. Strong PIMS placements in the first quarter were supported by continued preference for cloud-native products, with IDEXX well-positioned to address this trend. Placements of cloud-based products maintained the strong velocity we saw coming out of 2022 and represented greater than 90% of total placements supported by continued high interest in our ezyVet and Neo solutions, which are seamlessly integrated into our product offering. This provides customers with options when it comes to picking the best, most relevant PIMS solution for their clinic size and workflow complexity. Our strong first quarter placement performance supported double-digit recurring revenue growth with an attractive gross margin profile and we're on track to achieve this year a PIMS footprint that is over 50% cloud-based. This milestone is especially important in the current veterinary clinic environment, where productivity is a priority in addressing the sustained high levels of demand seen through the pandemic. By embracing IDEXX's cloud-based ecosystem, customers gain the advantage of an easy-to-use software stack that touches every area of the veterinary clinic. And the benefit of these tools is enduring for our customers, evidenced by strong engagement metrics across applications -- including increasing rates of our Web PACS user base that are power users as well as sustained rates of VetConnect PLUS users who use the software as part of their daily routine. Adoption and continued use of these products allows veterinarians and their staffs to spend more time focusing on the care they deliver to their patients rather than on costly, time-intensive administrative activities. Our software strategy is to increase cloud-adoption and build increased business and clinical functionality into IDEXX software solutions. Another use case of our innovation agenda is our 4Dx Plus Test, the gold standard test for canine vector-borne disease testing. The current 4Dx Plus Test is our fourth version on a multiplexed canine vector-borne disease diagnostics over the past 20 plus years with improved sensitivity of Anaplasma and 2x increase in the ability to store the product at room temperature. This is a true testament to our Technology for Life strategy and supported 12% global organic rapid assay recurring revenue growth and solid customer gains in the first quarter. A full vector-borne screen using 4Dx Plus is recommended over a Heartworm-only test given significant increases in incidence and prevalence of vector-borne diseases over the past 10 plus years. And yet, in 2022 less than one in every five dogs received this comprehensive level of testing. 4Dx Plus enables veterinarians to deliver this higher standard of care, with follow-up testing and care protocol guidance provided through DecisionIQ, which aim to drive better health outcomes, while encouraging increased diagnostic testing. Furthermore, our entire rapid assay franchise is supported by the SNAP Pro analyzer. The analyzer not only simplifies the workflow when running a SNAP test, but also ensures the diagnostic results flow seamlessly to VetConnect PLUS and ultimately result in charge capture and invoicing at the point of sale. This is a clear case of how our products, integral components of our connected software ecosystem, improve in value over time, while delivering a multiplier benefit to our customers and drive IDEXX CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue. The sustained execution against our commercial and innovation agendas is made possible by an unrelenting focus on our customers and ensuring they have world-class experience with IDEXX. This takes multiple forms, all focused to ensure our customers and the resources they need to provide the best possible levels of medical care. Continued 99% plus product availability and reliable, fast reference lab service turnaround times provide them with important business continuity and are the result of our investment in manufacturing and supply chain logistics teams, facilities, and relationships. Additionally, the support of the high-touch, highly knowledgeable sales teams that we have built out over the decades ensures they have the products and services that are right for their busy clinics. Our customers realize the benefits of the IDEXX partnership every day, and in turn reward us with their business and their enduring loyalty, as measured by another quarter of consistent, high customer retention rates. Providing our customers with reliable, consistent support is even more essential right now given the dynamic backdrop of our sector. High demand for animal medical services combined with sustained labor supply constraints continue to create productivity and growth challenges at the clinic level. Taking our customer support efforts a step further, we recently published an empirically based study, which examines the drivers of productivity within a practice and helps customers to understand their productivity strengths and areas for opportunities. Through this rigorous effort we found three key drivers of practice productivity. Number one workflow, which includes staffing models like optimized technician to veterinarian mix, and staff and patient friendly physical layout of the practice. Number two technology or digitizing each step of the patient workflow to remove high effort administrative routines. Number three the role of culture including clarity of roles and responsibilities, investments in training and staff effectiveness, and aligned incentives to drive teamwork and achievement of practice goals. As a result of this initiative, we believe there is still a great opportunity for clinics to improve productivity measures and we look forward to educating and supporting our customers in these efforts. Opportunities to do so could result in 30% or more incremental visit capacity, even for practices that are in the top cohort of productivity. We are integrating elements of these efforts into our strategy and commercial approach this year. With that, I'll now conclude the prepared remarks portion of the call by thanking our nearly 11,000 IDEXX colleagues for the commitment and passion they bring to our purpose-driven work every day. Your efforts not only help provide a better future for animals, people, and our planet, but you also supported IDEXX in starting 2023 on a strong financial note. We have an attractive sector and a strong track record, and the opportunity ahead of us, which is significant is to work with our customers to elevate companion animal healthcare standards through increased diagnostics utilization. The tireless work of the IDEXX team has positioned us well to deliver solid growth and financial results into the future. So, on behalf of the management team, thank you for your continued focus on enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people, and livestock. Now, let's open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. To ask a question, we'll take our first question from Nathan Rich. Nathan Rich : Thanks for the question. Jay Mazelsky : Hi, Nate. Nathan Rich : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. I had two on the updated guidance. Brian, on top-line, I think you've talked about targeting the high-end of the CAG Dx recurring revenue range at 11%. First quarter came in a bit better than expected. I guess any change in how you're thinking about getting to that for the full-year? And any change in assumptions on either kind of the U.S. or international outlooks based on what you've seen through the first quarter? Brian McKeon : Thanks for your question. We have a similar outlook at the high-end. I think we feel very good about the start to the year, particularly in the U.S. And so I think the drivers of that, we highlighted pricing being a positive driver for us this year and the execution is consistent with what we had expected. And I think the executional drivers that help to deliver solid volume growth in the U.S., we're very encouraged by. And looking to build on that. I think internationally, we also saw excellent execution drivers I mentioned, we had double-digit growth benefit from things like new business gains, including benefits from strong instrument placements, higher pricing. We are seeing continued headwinds from macro factors in international markets. So the growth was somewhat below our higher end target so on balance, we feel a good start to the year. I still think that's a good full-year goal for the company and looking forward to continuing to execute well to deliver against it. Nathan Rich : Okay. And then I wanted to ask a follow-up on the operating margin guidance. I think you mentioned kind of unchanged outside of the FX impact. Gross margin, I think you said came in better than expected, but was offset I guess by higher OpEx. Could you maybe just talk about how that plays out over the balance of the year? Especially sales and marketing, I think was up meaningfully as a percent of revenue in the first quarter. Just what drove that increase? And how should we think about the run rate for the full-year? Brian McKeon : Yes, let me try to break that down. We had an expectation for the first quarter for an improvement in reported operating margins of 50 to 100 basis points. We came in at 150. So that was better than expected. That was principally on the gross margin line. We saw some benefit in the quarter from kind of later than time planned staffing in areas like our labs and some specific operational factors more Q1 related. So I think we feel good about the overall performance and do think that the high-end goals that we have are still appropriate. As we highlighted coming into the year, we knew that we had some costs coming back here, just more interface with our customers, more travel I think we're anticipating that to continue. We're trying to support our employees in a higher inflation environment as well. And we do have investments that we're advancing in areas like R&D. I know we've highlighted in the past a couple of new platforms that we're advancing that we're investing behind. So those are all captured in our outlook. I think on balance, our performance is very much in line with what we're targeting again, a good start to the year. And we think the full-year goal is on an -- if we adjust out the R&D lapping and the customer contract resolution payment for a solid 60 basis point comparable improvement and right in line with what we were hoping to achieve this year, and we look forward to working to deliver on that. Nathan Rich : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : Great, thanks very much. Just two questions for me. The first was just any comments on the Mars Heska proposed acquisition and the impact that could have on the competitive landscape. And then my second one was just a question on price. Just trying to get my hands around just feedback you're getting on the moves you've made. And are you seeing any impact at all on demand from these changes? We think about whether it's wellness visits or less acute conditions. I know that's kind of -- seems to be kind of a topic that's top of mind for investors. So I just love to have any just directional comments of what you're hearing on price would be appreciated. Thank you. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. Good morning, Chris. This is Jay. So let me take your second question first, and then I'll address the acquisition. Overall, we think pricing to our customers is appropriate within the current environment. From an overall demand standpoint, we see that holding up well relative to the macro conditions, as we've described it in the different pricing scenarios. From just a pet owner perspective, we think they've demonstrated and willingness. We see this both from experience as well as just the survey work that they continue to prioritize health care for their pets. And keep in mind that diagnostics is a relatively small piece of the overall patient spend on their pets. Specifically to your point around wellness versus non-wellness, we've seen the two pretty much move in lockstep over the last five quarters. Or so of course, if the macro -- when we see sort of the macro deterioration from an environmental standpoint during the pandemic, there was some divergence. But generally, at least over the last year plus, they've moved in lockstep. And just an interesting, I think proof point of that, if you take a look at the 4Dx diagnostics testing, it's been highly durable. That's primarily a wellness test and we think indicative of the good end customer demand and pull-through. From the standpoint of the Mars Heska acquisition, just as a matter of policy, we don't comment on specific customer relationships, except to say that no single customer comprises more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. Our customer base is very large and diversified. I think as you know and we maintain and have excellent relationships and a great long-term track record with our corporate customers. They, I think very much appreciate the broad solution portfolio both on the diagnostics as well as software side where we can support their objectives to grow and deliver great care. And it probably just as importantly, footprint-wise to be where there. I think the acquisition itself reflects what we've said all along the attractiveness of the animal health sector and more specifically, diagnostics that we think \u2013 long-term, that it can help support the overall market or sector development of diagnostics. Christopher Schott : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Jon Block from Stifel. Jonathan Block : Yes, hi. It's Jon from Stifel. Is it -- can you guys hear me okay? Jay Mazelsky : Yes, we can. Jonathan Block : Sorry, the operator jumped in, I guess, is the -- sorry about that. First question, Brian, it was a good quarter. The CAG Dx revenue of $11.6 million was above the high end of your prior 8.5% to 11%. And I think you expected on the last call 1Q '23 to be more at the midpoint of the annual guide, and you came in above the high end. So maybe just talk to us on what drove the upside. I believe price was in line with your prior thoughts. So do you chalk it up more to U.S. than international? That would be my knee-jerk reaction. But would love to hear from you. And then if it is in the U.S., is it more specific to call it, IDEXX drivers? Or did you see some upside, call it, industry visits relative to where your head was at three months ago? Brian McKeon : Yes, thanks for the question, Jon. We did have a really good start to the year in the U.S. I think our pricing, as you pointed out was globally in line with what we had planned. So we feel good about the execution there. I would say the U.S. clinical visits were overall for the quarter a little better than we anticipated. They were flat, as I mentioned, and we thought we'd still be working through some compares on that front. I think we got some benefit really early in the quarter, I think with some positive growth that helped there. And the -- our own volume execution, the difference between how much growth is coming from our volume relative to clinical visits was a solid 5%, that's kind of pre-pandemic level. So we -- that was in line with kind of where we're hoping to achieve. So on balance, U.S. combined came through quite well. I think international was in line, I would say with what we were guiding towards. We had very good execution as noted and continue to see some macro headwinds that we're working through. So on balance, I think we feel good about the start to the year, as I shared earlier. And we have some goals at the higher end that would help us deliver 10% overall organic growth, which is our goal and we think we're working well towards that. And we're acknowledging that we're in an environment where there is some macro risk, and we think it's proven to have a range of estimates there and continue to monitor those trends as we work through the year. But I think on balance, we feel good about the start. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. And I would just build on that to say that I would build on Brian's comments and just emphasize the excellent commercial drivers that we've talked about certainly pricing, as Brian mentioned, new customer acquisition has been strong, both U.S. and internationally. Customer retention rates continue to remain strong. I think the customer interest and appetite for technology, we see that in premium instrument placements as well as software. And I think that's really reflective of the -- some of the capacity challenges that they see. So overall, I think from an execution standpoint, a very strong quarter. Jonathan Block : Perfect. That was helpful, guys. Thanks for that. And then I might have a couple of parts to it. But before just below the line for the guide -- is it essentially a wash like there's some less interest expense, but there's less share repo. You had some wording around the hedges and the way that flows through the change. So just broadly speaking below the line, is it a wash when we think about your current '23 EPS versus where it was back in February. And then the second part of that question is, guys even if you keep it at a high level, can you just talk about what needs to be done for the two new point-of-care systems? And are those initiatives running in parallel, just when we think about timing there? Thanks for your help. Brian McKeon : Yes, just to clarify on the profit guide, our operating margin outlook is consistent. We have a slightly higher headwind from FX. And so on a comparable basis, the high end is the same and the low end is up, I think slightly. We obviously have some positive flow-through from raising the low end of the revenue. So that's the EPS adjustment. And you're correct. We had lower interest expense projected to offset by relatively lower projected reductions in shares outstanding. So that was a net flat effect. Jay Mazelsky : And I would just say from a product development standpoint, I'm not going to be specific, obviously, but we are running parallel programs. We continue to invest in software assays, instruments. We spend a lot of money on innovation. We think there's great opportunities across the portfolio and we'll continue to provide updates as we get closer. Jonathan Block : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Ryskin from Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : Great, thanks for taking the question guys. Jay, Brian, I want to start on OUS specifically. Could you just clarify -- I think you said 8% OUS. Was that CAG recurring or CAG total? And then just in general, did that come in line with expectations? Anything specific you can call out on OUS results? I think you just commented on the macro environment, but anyone that you can point to either by region or by sort of the factors that are driving that? Brian McKeon : Yes, let me clarify the numbers. I'll let Jay talk to the regional dynamics. It was 8% -- 7.6% CAG Dx recurring. And Mike, I would say that's pretty much in line with the outlook that we shared for the quarter. I think the execution drivers were very -- were strong, in line. We had 17% growth in instrument placements, double-digit benefit from things that weren't related to same-store sales dynamics. And we continue to see the kind of pressure that we've seen on macro -- for macro trends on the same-store side. But we've been building that into our outlook, and I think that was in line with what we were anticipating and kind of consistent with our full-year view as well. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. I mean just to support that, we've seen relatively speaking, more macro impacts outside the U.S. As I had mentioned previously, our execution drivers internationally have been excellent. We've done seven commercial expansions. And when you take a look at those targeted expansions, we're doing well. We think we're bringing more focus. And from a frequency and visit standpoint, the type of successful model that we've implemented in the U.S. From an instrument and business-focused standpoint, we've seen excellent results in premium instrument placements to pick 19% on the Catalyst side, really strong, the quality has been really strong from both competitive and new placements. And so we're optimistic. And I think the regions are working or other countries within the regions are working through their specific challenges. But we're optimistic that the long-term demand is there. Michael Ryskin : Okay. Great, thanks. And then for the follow-up, going back to the organic growth guide for the year and some of your assumptions on vet visit growth. I think previously, you'd said that on the high end of the guide, you're baking in a relative flattening of clinical vet visit growth trends as you work through the year. And as you said, you kind of saw them in the first quarter already. So what do you need to see from vet visit sort of quite a chance to say, okay, we're here already, things have definitely improved ready to revise upward? Is that just a matter of seeing these trends continue for another quarter or so? Or is there something that you saw in between the numbers that give you pause? Brian McKeon : Maybe I can provide a little color there. On the U.S. side, where we're more explicit on how we're thinking about the visit trends, as I mentioned the overall, it was -- clinical visits were relatively flat in the quarter. I think we are encouraged that it appears that we're working through the headwinds that were related to capacity staffing. So that seems to be normalizing. I would point out it was stronger earlier in Q1 than how we exited the quarter. So the visits were down a bit in March, and that continued into early April. So I think this is an ongoing dynamic in terms of just the macro backdrop and the ongoing adaptation of clinics to adding staff and kind of getting back to their normal growth rates. But I think we're feeling good about kind of working through some of those headwinds that we highlighted. And an area that we'll continue to monitor and we're actively trying to help clinics through productivity improvement, get back to the positive growth rates that they've been able to support in the past. Jay Mazelsky : Yes, to Brian's point, the practices from our perspective, speaking now to the U.S. have largely stabilized. We've seen stabilization of ours, for example. I think there's been a really strong appetite and enthusiasm for technology, specifically with a focus on productivity and supporting capacity. Certainly, we've seen heightened interest in software as a way of supporting staff productivity, workflow optimization, removing the sort of high administrative unrewarded tasks. Keep in mind, if you take a look at 2022, there was a 2% net addition in pets in the U.S. That's twice the level pre-pandemic. So I think there's a lot of underserved demand out there, and practices are working through, how they serve that demand. So good progress. I think the other thing is finding the time study, we think identify some things that practices are doing and could do, and there's been a lot of receptivity and enthusiasm for that work and how they can find a couple of minutes here, a couple of minutes there that cumulatively make a big difference. Michael Ryskin : Got it, really helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ryan Daniels from William Blair. Jack Senft : Yes, hey guys, this is Jack Senft on for Ryan Daniels. Thanks for taking my question. I have two just pretty quick ones. First, can you remind us on the ProCyte One placement goals, replacements goal. I believe the 20,000 goal is for 2026, correct? So I believe in your prepared remarks, you said that you're already over that -- you're already over 50% to that target. So just curious if you can touch on the good performance in these placements that seems to be almost ahead of schedule. And then two, do you expect the adoption to slow down? Or is there a good amount of upside potential to that 20,000 target? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. So let me address the -- so we had said that we have 9,400 ProCyte One placements, which is nearly half of the goal itself. And I think what we're seeing is a really nice fit with the platform itself from both performance and cost and footprint standpoint. So there's been a lot of, I think customer adoption based on the fact that it fits their practice needs. Keep in mind, internationally which is where we think the larger part of the marketplace is, in many countries, it's hematology first. They do sort of a general body systems diagnostic and then, in some cases, include chemistry or may include chemistry with it. So it does hematology first marketplace. They see this as a key addition to their in-clinic diagnostics suite. And we've done well with that. Brian McKeon : Yes, I'd just highlight the multiplier benefits to the ProCyte One launch. If you look at the growth in the overall installed base, we had double-digit growth across Catalyst, premium hematology and SediVue. So it's -- and we had a very strong quarter for Catalyst and SediVue placements, building on the lapping of the launch last year that was very successful for ProCyte One. So I think the benefit of having additions to a platform isn't just related to the platform itself but the overall business growth. Jack Senft : Perfect. Understood. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up. Over the past few quarters, the narrative of cloud within the animal health industry seems to have accelerated. And just given the financial hardships that practices currently face, can you just talk about the pricing differences between average cloud-based solutions versus like on-prem or hardware solutions? And then for new practices starting up, are they typically going just right into the cloud? Or I guess like what is the opportunity here? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. So new practices are generally going right into the cloud. So they're trying to buy and use contemporary technology. Cloud-based systems are obviously priced as SaaS services. So there's a monthly annuity. There's still upfront costs in terms of data migration and onboarding and training and those things associated with getting a practice. I think the big difference from a cost standpoint at least is in the life cycle of the solution itself. The practice system had to worry about replacing servers every three, four, five years and paying for ongoing maintenance. The other big benefit is they get software updates pushed to them on a pretty frequent basis without having to necessarily send somebody out to the site and take the system offline, whether it's a couple of hours or more. So there's a lot of -- I think there's a lot of cost benefits over the life cycle of the solution as well as feature functionality improvements that they get. And therefore, that's driving, I think at least in the veterinary industry a newfound appreciation for updating the more modern or contemporary software solutions. Operator : Our next question comes from Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley. Erin Wright : Sorry, hopefully, you can hear me now. So... Brian McKeon : Hey Erin, we missed the beginning of -- yes sorry, we missed the beginning. Erin Wright : No worries. No worries. So can you talk a little bit about the pet oncology diagnostics opportunity? Why does it make sense for you to partner in this category versus buy? And do you think that this could be a more meaningful driver for you longer term or more limited? Just curious how you're thinking about that at this juncture? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. Thank you, Erin. We think it's a very significant opportunity, just based on the number of pets that develop cancer. So it's the biggest cause of death, mortality of within the pet population. So if you take a look at the U.S., there's six million dogs a year that get cancer, 3x mortality rate of the next sort of greatest cause of death. The diagnosis and staging and treatment protocols today are very fragmented. They tend to be late by the time it's very clinically obvious and then you have to pick the sample and send it out to the pathology lab. And at that point, cancer may be Stage 3, Stage 4 difficult to treat. The other piece is that there aren't a lot of oncology specialists. If you take a look at North America, it's 350 to 400. So most of the camps are diagnosing, and treatment is happening through the general practitioner who aren't specialists. They have a lot of other responsibilities. And so being able to provide diagnostics as a testing regime for them, we think is a really attractive opportunity, we both partner and have internal development efforts. Keep in mind that from a cancer standpoint, just our pathology submissions on a global basis, over 1.3 million a year. So this isn't a new area for us. This is something that we're well versed in and provide a service across the globe for us. So this is just really expanding or enhancing so that we move earlier into being able to support our customers to diagnose cancer while it's still -- you have better chances at being able to treat it. Erin Wright : Great. And on -- I know you commented a little bit on the Heska Mars deal. But do you anticipate more opportunities in terms of corporate relationships coming up outside of, obviously, Mars? And with a couple of their relationships on the Heska side coming up for bid within the next year, is that meaningful at all? What's the competitive response? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yes, I mean we have -- generally, we have relationships with both corporate accounts across some of our different testing modalities or product lines. We do think there are some customers who may be sensitive continuing with our competitors. It still comes down. It's a very competitive market. It still comes down to -- we're going to have to compete customer to customer. And we think that the broadest possible solution to support their growth objectives is what, at the end of the day, wins. And we'll continue to focus on that. Erin Wright : Thanks. Operator : And our last question comes from David Westenberg from Piper Sandler. David Westenberg : Hi, thank you for taking the question here. Sorry, if it went over my head in terms of the FX here. I think on the change in guide, it was from 500 -- or 50 basis points on revenue to 200 -- to 20 basis points on revenue. but then on EPS, it went up. Sorry, I might be a little thickheaded here. Can you explain what's happening on the top line? I think of you as an exporter. So I'm just a little bit confused there. I know you've given commentary, but maybe I'm a little slower than others. And then I'll just ask my second one upfront here. Can you talk about -- again, another one on the Mars Heska thing, but I want to go at a different angle. Your win rate against Antech has been pretty high. And at least my checks from -- with veterinarians tend to see that they kind of have -- don't like going against their competitor. So is there any chance you can have additional win rates in the inside lab here with kind of that angle and kind of how to think about that dynamic? Thank you very much. Brian McKeon : Yes. So David, just on your FX questions, you're correct on revenue. We think the full-year is relatively flat now versus what we thought was a 0.5 point headwind. That's the $10 million positive adjustment in revenue. It didn't flow through to EPS, just given mix of currencies and hedge positions. So it's -- we have a share of all the assumptions relative to rates, but we have a model that we go through looking at all those factors, and it didn't have a net impact just because we're largely hedged at this point, and just the mix of the impacts weren't as favorable. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. And then to answer the -- your second question, we don't think about it necessarily as migration of one modality to the other based on the competitive landscape. Customers use both clinic as well as reference labs. They choose partners based on a variety of your product and solution differentiation, cost, service, footprint, all those things. So we think there's still going to be the primary drivers of who corporate customers and independent customers choose, and I'll leave it at that. So with that, we'll conclude the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you for your participation this morning. And to summarize, I'll reiterate that IDEXX is committed to the significant multi-decade opportunity to increase the standard of care for Companion Animal health care. We look forward to executing our organic strategy to address this opportunity. IDEXX teams continued to perform at a high level building of the investments we made over the past decades to develop our sector. And we look forward to continuing strong progress against our strategy through 2023. And now we'll conclude the call. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable measures are provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. In reviewing our second quarter 2023 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth, and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2022, unless otherwise noted. [Operator Instructions]. Today's prepared remarks will be posted to the Investor Relations section of idexx.com after the earnings conference call concludes. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today I'll take you to our Q2 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2023. In terms of highlights, IDEXX achieves strong growth and financial performance in the second quarter aligned with our full-year performance goals. Overall revenues increased 10% organically supported by 12% organic growth and CAG diagnostic recurring revenues with double-digit gains in U.S. and international regions. Key execution metrics remain very strong globally, reflected in record second quarter premium instrument placements, continued solid new business gains, and sustained high growth in recurring veterinary software revenues. Operating profit results were ahead of our expectations, reflecting solid gross margin gains and operating expense leverage, both benefiting from strong CAG recurring revenue growth. For the first half of 2023, we achieved 10% overall organic revenue growth and nearly 12% growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. We also achieved better-than-targeted operating margin improvement. We've made positive refinements to our full-year operational outlook incorporating this performance, which we'll discuss later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our second quarter results. Second quarter organic revenue growth of 10% was driven by 11% CAG gains and 9% organic growth in our water business. Overall organic revenue growth was constrained by modest gains in our LPD business and approximately $3 million of headwind related to lower opti medical revenues reflecting the winddown of our human COVID testing business. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue increased 12% organically, reflecting 12% gains in the U.S. and 10% growth in international regions. CAG diagnostics recurring revenue growth in Q2 was supported by global net price gains at the higher end of our targeted 8% to 9% improvement range for the first half of 2023. Overall organic revenue growth was supported by 13% growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues. CAG instrument revenues were down 6% organically reflecting comparisons to high-priority levels, program pricing effects, and global mix. IDEXX CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth remained solidly above sector growth levels. In the U.S., we achieved a consistent, strong 1,370 basis point growth premium in Q2 compared to same-store U.S. clinical visit growth levels, which declined an estimated 1.3% in the quarter. These results reflect benefits from IDEXX execution drivers, including higher net price realization. Solid U.S. volume growth was supported by new business gains, high customer retention levels, and continued increases in diagnostic frequency and utilization at the practice level. International CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth improved organically to 10% in Q2, reflecting positive volume gains and benefits from higher net price realization. International results were also supported by strong IDEXX execution, reflected in sustained new business gains and record Q2 premium instrument placements, which supported a double digit expansion of our premium instrument install base. Double digit growth rate benefits from IDEXX execution offset impacts from challenging international macro conditions, which continued to pressure same-store volume growth trends in the quarter. Globally, Q2 results were supported by strong growth of IDEXX in-clinic CAG diagnostic revenues. IDEXX VETLAB consumer revenues increased 15% organically with double digit gains in U.S. and international regions. Consumer gains were supported by 11% year-on-year growth in our global premium instrument install base, reflecting strong gains across our catalysts, premium hematology, and set-of-you platforms. We placed 4,740 CAG premium instruments in Q2, an increase of 7% year-on-year compared to very strong prior year levels, which included benefits from our international launch of ProCyte One. Catalyst placements increased 15% globally, reflecting 8% gains in the U.S. and 19% placement growth in international regions. The quality of instrument placements continues to be excellent, demonstrated by 9% global growth in new and competitive catalyst placements, and solid gains in EVI metrics. ProCyte One momentum also continues to be strong globally, reflected in a global install base of approximately 10,800 instruments. Global rapid asset revenues expanded 12% organically in Q2, driven by strong growth in the U.S., reflecting solid volume gains and benefits from higher net price realization. Global Lab revenues increased 9% organically, reflecting double digit gains in the U.S. and mid-single-digit growth in international, with growth in international regions moderated by macroeconomic impacts, which pressure on same-store sales. In other areas of our CAG business, veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 13% organically. Results were supported by continued high levels of organic growth in recurring software and digital imaging revenues, and ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. Water revenue increased 9% organically in Q2, reflecting continued solid gains in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America, including benefits from net price improvement. The integration and performance of our recent Tecta-PDS acquisition continues to progress well, expanding our capabilities in water safety testing, and adding approximately 2% to reported water growth. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenue increased 1% organically, as strong gains in the U.S. were offset by impacts from lower herd health screening revenues related to reduced China import testing. Turning to the P&L, Q2 profit results were supported by solid gross profit gains. Gross profit increased 11% in the quarter, as reported, and 13% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 60.7% up 160 basis points on a comparable basis. These gains reflect benefits from higher net price realization, lab productivity and operational initiatives, improvement in software service gross margins, and business mix, which offset inflationary cost effects. As expected, reported gross margin gains were moderated by a 60 basis point negative impact related to forward exchange changes, including the lapping of prior year hedge gains. While forward exchange trends have improved, we're expecting approximately 70 to 80 basis points of negative impact in year-on-year reported gross margin comparisons in the second half of 2023, as we work through lapping of $18 million of prior year foreign exchange hedge gains. On a reported basis, operating expenses decreased 17% year-on-year, reflecting a 26% favorable growth rate impact from comparisons to prior year levels, which included $80 million in discrete R&D investment. Adjusting for this effect, operating expense growth was modestly below revenue growth in the quarter, supporting operating margin gains. EPS was $2.67 per share in Q2, an increase of 71% as reported. On a comparable basis, EPS increased 77%, including approximately 54% of growth rate benefit from lapping the 72% per share prior year impact from discrete R&D investments. Forward exchange reduced operating profits by $8 million, and EPS by $0.07 per share in the quarter, including impacts from lapping $6 million in prior year hedge gains. Impacts from 2023 foreign exchange hedges were limited in the quarter. Free cash flow was $173 million in the second quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion ratio was 75%. For the full year, we're maintaining our outlook for free cash flow conversion of 80% to 90%, including estimated capital spending of approximately $180 million. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 0.9 times gross and 0.7 times net of cash. Share repurchases over the last year supported a 1% reduction diluted shares outstanding. We did allocate capital share repurchases in the second quarter as we managed our balance sheet relatively more conservatively in the current interest rate environment. Turning to our 2023 P&L outlook, we're refining our full year outlook to incorporate our solid first half operating results and updated estimates for foreign exchange impacts. Our updated full year guidance for reported revenues is $3,660 million to $3,750 million, reflecting an 8.5% to 10% organic growth range. This outlook includes a $15 million favorable adjustment for foreign exchange changes, which we now estimate will have a relatively flat full year impact on reported revenue growth at the rate shown in our press release. In terms of our operational growth outlook, we're maintaining our performance goals aligned with the high end of our guidance range of 10% overall organic revenue growth, supported by 11% CAG diagnostic recurring revenue gains. This reflects expectations for consistent strong levels of IDEXX execution aligned with H1 trends. Our outlook incorporates approximately 1% of expected H2 headwinds for CAG diagnostic recurring revenues from equivalent days effects. Consistent with earlier guidance, our high end outlook for CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth reflects expectations for 6% to 7% net price gains and a relative flattening of U.S. same-store or clinical visit growth trends in H2. We've raised the low end of our full year organic revenue growth outlook by 1% to reflect our strong first half performance. We've also made positive adjustments to our outlook for operating margin performance in 2023. Our updated outlook is for reported operating margins in the range of 29.3% to 29.7% for the full year. At the high end, this reflects an outlook for approximately 360 basis points in comparable operating margin expansion. This includes approximately 280 basis points in combined benefit from the $16 million Q1 customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of $80 million of discreet R&D investment in the second quarter of 2022. Our operating margin outlook reflects expectations for moderated year-on-year comparable gross margin gains in the second half compared to strong prior year levels. We continue to project that foreign exchange will reduce operating margins by approximately 60 basis points this year, primarily related to impacts and lapping of $26 million in 2022 hedge gains. We estimate that foreign exchange impacts will decrease EPS by approximately $0.21 per share for the full year with approximately $0.02 per share of negative impact in the second half, including effects from hedge gain lapping. Our updated EPS outlook is $9.64 to $9.90 per share. This is an increase of $0.23 per share at midpoint, reflecting $0.17 in benefit from our raised operational outlook and $0.06 in combined benefit from refined interest expense and foreign exchange estimates. In terms of our operational outlook for Q3, we're planning for organic revenue growth at the lower end of our updated full year growth range, incorporating expected impacts from approximately 1% of equivalent day headwinds. We expect foreign exchange to provide approximately 1.5% in reported growth rate benefit in the quarter. We're planning for operating margins in the 28.5% to 29% range, reflecting expectations for relatively consistent comparable operating margin performance, adjusting for unfavorable foreign exchange margin impacts of approximately 50 basis points during the right hedge gain lapping. We've provided details in our updated full year outlook in the press release tables and earning snapshot. That concludes our financial review. I will now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Jay Mazelsky : Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX once again delivered strong results supported by outstanding execution in the second quarter. We advanced our strategy by engaging customers with integrated testing solutions that support their mission and address real-world clinical and practice problems. Demand for medical services remains high, and veterinary and [CAG diagnostics] as a core enabler to guide individualized best care. As a result, we saw strong diagnostic sector revenue growth, with continued gains in diagnostics testing frequency and utilization. IDEXX remains well positioned to further benefit from these trends, thanks to our decades-on focus on diagnostics and the software solutions that deliver key differentiated insights into the patient's health. IDEXX's strong results are reflected in double-digit, total company organic revenue growth, supported by expansion of CAG diagnostics-recurring revenues across regions. For the first time ever, U.S. revenues exceeded $1 billion in the first half of 2023. IDEXX execution drivers continue to fire in all cylinders, as reflected in our financial results, including growth in high-quality premium instrument placements, sustained high-customer retention levels, contribution from new business gains, and net price realization that remains aligned with our expectations. IDEXX commercial teams delivered yet another record quarter of global premium instrument placements, building off high prior year levels and supporting solid EVI gains for the quarter. IDEXX diagnostics and software solutions deliver key insights and productivity improvements to workflow transformation. These results demonstrate that greater number of clinicians are partnering with IDEXX, with the aim to deliver higher care standards and crucial efficiency gains. This support continues to be an important given persistent clinic productivity constraints in a dynamic macro backdrop. Today I'll discuss how IDEXX delivered continued strong performance through key strategic initiatives aimed at driving sector development. I'll start by providing an update on our global commercial execution. It's a key component in driving increased testing utilization of both existing customers as well as new to IDEXX accounts. They are [nearing] around the world seek testing solutions that provide them with key diagnostic insights necessary to choosing and delivering the right care path in an efficient and intuitive way. IDEXX commercial teams, as trusted advisors, seek to provide the most appropriate solution given a practice's objectives. It's a deep appetite for point-of-care solutions that deliver the right performance, ease of use, workflow integration, and economics. Therefore, it was gratifying to see a record second quarter of global premium instrument placements with record placements in both the U.S. and internationally. Second quarter premium placements reflected growth across regions and platforms, highlighting the values that clinicians across different geographies at various stages of practice maturity see in our highly innovative platforms and integrated ecosystem. An important dimension of this success is our menu of customer-friendly marketing programs to adopt IDEXX innovations. The result was continued solid gains in EVI and excellent contribution from new business gains, including a new key U.S. corporate account, very strong ongoing placement performance, and our solid relationships with accounts of all types reinforces our confidence in future flow-through of recurring revenues, and our ability to address the estimated 220,000 global instrument placement opportunities. Our commercial performance this year demonstrates that we have developed the right suite of innovative products to address this significant opportunity. ProCyte One is a great example of this. It's our newest, easy-to-use premium hematology platform. ProCyte One boosts efficiency gains, including load and go reagents in paper-run models while still delivering uncompromised accuracy. It has been a key driver of strong premium hematology placements since its launch in early 2021 and supported record second quarter premium hematology placements. Not only does the growing hematology-installed base support flow-through of recurring revenues, but also drives our broader and clinic business. Sustained mid-90% attach rates with catalysts provide a multiplier benefit that drives growth in our customer base and helps customers realize the benefits of an integrated IDEXX diagnostic suite within their clinics. These multiplied effects supported the strong 15% global growth achieved in catalyst placements in Q2. Strong gains globally and new and competitive accounts. ProCyte One also helps to advance our long-term growth strategy in international regions where most veterinarians are trained to do hematology testing when assessing a patient's baseline health. Strong second quarter performance included double-digit CAG diagnostics recurring revenue growth also benefited from the country-level commercial expansions we began in mid-2020. By increasing the density of our commercial reach, IDEXX sales professionals are better able to build relationships with veterinarians and communicate the benefits of diagnostics and software solution utilization and how IDEXX can support them on that journey. The global opportunity we've identified is significant and these expanded commercial teams are the tip of the spear in our multi-modality strategy to drive continued sector development. Benefits from these investments are highly encouraged as evidenced by strong installed based growth supported by excellent placements and new and competitive accounts, revenue gains from new business, and improving customer engagement levels in key international regions. Of additional note, we have also executed a modest expansion of U.S. territories and customer-facing professionals based on highly attractive opportunities still before us in our largest geography. We anticipate all hiring to be completed and in place by the end of this year. In addition to high quality and quantity of instrument placements across regions in Q2, commercial execution helped drive continued adoption of IDEXX innovations, including within our rapid vector board disease screening franchise. Our VDC teams have done a great job communicating the health benefits of a full vector board disease screen versus Heartworm-Only testing. We see consequently 40x plus making up a greater share of in-clinic vector board disease revenue. This adoption is supported by our growing installed base of SNAP Pros, which provides an integrated solution while managing workflow and ensuring charge capture. These focused commercial efforts, combined with relevant and easy to use products, highlights how we continue to build our customer base, which positions IDEXX well for long-term growth. Building on these commercial efforts, IDEXX's growth will continue to benefit from advancement of our innovation strategy, a core component of which is expanding our highly accurate and relevant test menu. We made a significant step forward in this area during the second quarter when we announced the launch of the IDEXX [statinb]test in our North American reference lab network. This novel marker leverages IDEXX IP to help clinicians detect kidney injury, a hard to diagnose condition that comprises approximately one-third of all kidney cases seen by veterinarians. Cell care is a critical area for diagnostics insights, since the kidneys regulate blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and red blood cell production, while also removing toxins. By adding the staff and B to our Reno portfolio and by pairing it with IDEXX SDMA, our customers will have access to the most comprehensive view of kidney health, helping them uncover structural injury and impaired kidney function. What's even more exciting is we will leverage our SDMA playbook to support adoption by including [statinb] test panels for approximately 2 million patients annually at no additional cost, helping clinicians realize the benefits of IDEXX's world-class diagnostics and deliver a higher standard of care to their patients. IDEXX diagnostic solutions, like the innovative staff and B test, when used in an integrated way with our software portfolio, can contextualize an individual patient's health status and support the veterinarian with interpretation and drawing out the appropriate clinical insights. Our software portfolio, which includes a full stack of solutions, many of which leverage cloud technology, touches all areas of the veterinary clinic. From enabling patient check-ins in the full diagnostics workflow, depending on their communication and charge capture, IDEXX software solutions create a connected ecosystem that supports greater diagnostics utilization, while also helping our busy customers be more efficient. A key driver of customer interest we see in our software solutions is driven by the high demand customers are seeing for medical services. These solutions appeal to both independent and especially corporate customers who are increasingly focused on using software to standardize their workflow at scale. Given this backdrop of high demand for pet healthcare services, busy clinics continue to appreciate the value of cloud-based products, as these intuitive and easy-to-administer products allow them to spend more time focusing on the patients that walk in the door, rather than on time-consuming back-office tasks. In IDEXX cloud-based products, including our ezyVet and NEO PIMS and Web PACS's imaging software, continue to be in high demand as a response to this trend. For example, second quarter cloud-based PIMS once again comprised over 90% of total PIMS placements, and as a result make up nearly 50% of our PIMS installed base. This is a trend we expect to continue and are well positioned to address. In our digital imaging business, record first-half instrument placements supported double-digit organic growth and demonstrate that customers are increasingly choosing IDEXX to partner on this piece of their business. It helps grow our base for future high-margin recurring revenues. One driver of this interest is continued innovation of our Web PAC software, which makes it even easier for clinicians to interpret and identify hard-to-detect internal abnormalities. The result of these efforts is an excellent customer experience, which helped earn a world-class NPS rating for our diagnostic imaging business, one proof point of the solid overall experience that customers of all types have with IDEXX. This concludes our review of our second quarter results. I would like to extend my thanks to the nearly 11,000 IDEXX employees who helped deliver continued strong performance, aligned with our purpose of enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people, and livestock. We look forward to building on this progress. Before we move to Q&A, I would like to remind you that we'll be hosting our annual Investor Day in August, beginning with the management dinner on Wednesday, August 9, followed by presentations at our global headquarters in Westbrook, Maine on Thursday, August 10th at 8 a.m. Thursday's event will also be live-streamed and recorded via IDEXX.com for those who cannot make it in person. This is an exciting opportunity for the IDEXX's leadership team to provide updates on our strategy, execution drivers, innovation cycle, and long-term growth potential. Participating will be members of my senior management team, including Dr. Tina Hunt, Executive Vice President, Strategy, Sector Development and Global Operations, Dr. Mike Erickson, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Point of Care Diagnostics, Mike Lane Executive Vice President and General Manager for Reference Laboratories and Information Technology, Michael Shrek, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Veterinary Software and Services and Corporate Accounts, and Brian McKean, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We're also excited to host the live customer conversation led by Jim Pala\u0142acic, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer to provide a firsthand view of the role of diagnostics within the clinic and how IDEXX is supporting our customers in adapting to the dynamic sector backdrop. The event will last approximately four hours and will conclude with a Q&A session. And with that, we'll end the prepared section of the call and open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Great, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Two questions on volumes. I guess first in the U.S. Could you maybe talk, Brian about how clinical visits trended over the course of the quarter? I know you kind of said they had softened earlier in the quarter. Just curious how the quarter played out relative to your expectations and kind of what you're looking for to see that flattening over the balance of the year. And then on international, what drove the improvement in the international CAG growth this quarter? And I think kind of despite the improvement, reference lab kind of remains soft. Why do you think you maybe haven't seen more improvement in reference lab volumes? And can you maybe talk about expectations there for the back half of the year? Thank you. Brian McKeon : Thanks for your questions, Nate. On the first question, we saw a post-January relatively similar clinical visit trends in the data, I think with hindsight, January benefited from the year on year COVID lapping. And overall for the first quarter it was flat, but the benefit of from that dynamic and I think the clinical visit trends through Q2 were largely consistent. This was consistent with our expectation. We thought we'd see reduction in the headwinds from the clinical visit capacity pullback that happened last year. And we were still working through some compares on that front in the first half. And so that informed how we were thinking about the second half that we would see that normalize and hopefully over time improve given the strong underlying demand that we believe is out there. So that's sort of the U.S. story. Let me give some context on international. I'm sure Jay can add to this that the strength in international came from our in-clinic business, just the very strong growth in our instrument placements, customer engagement, support of strong consumable gains. And so I think that's directly related to our executional focus. And as you pointed out, labs were relatively consistent. We're still seeing the, have seen the macro headwinds relatively more in international markets. That's been a consistent story. And so that moderated what were double digit growth rate benefits from the executional drivers that enabled us to get to double digit overall growth in international markets. Jay Mazelsky : Yes, and just to add to that Nate, from a higher level standpoint, the clinic economics and overall health of the clinics really is healthy. I think revenue, we showed that revenue is growing nicely. So it's certainly not a demand dynamic. And as Brian said, internationally, we've been benefiting really over a number of quarters of record placements. ProCyte One obviously fits well and leverages and multiplies the impact that we've been able to have on total in clinic placement. So I think very strong execution. We're announcing the benefits of the consumables growth. And that has a small ramp to it, but I think the business is healthy. And we saw positive volume growth in Q2 internationally. So I think the clinics are working through the type of capacity constraints and labor challenges that they've had earlier. And we expect that to continue over time. Nathan Rich : Great, thanks for the details. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open, please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Katarina from J.P. Morgan on for Chris. Thank you so much for taking our questions. So first, just on pricing, I know you probably can't give too much specifics, but directionally, any initial thoughts on how you're going to approach price increases in 2024? On one hand, obviously inflation is slow, but then you also probably could see some upward pressure on cost. So does that warrant larger prices? Just how are you thinking about 2024 price increases? And then the second question is, so if you think about both clinical visit growth and then utilization, any major differences between what you're seeing for your corporate clinic accounts versus your non-profit but owned privately owned accounts? Thank you so much. Brian McKeon : Yes, so good morning. Thanks for your question. On the pricing front, first, I just want to reinforce we have a consistent outlook for the second half of 2023 for 6% to 7% overall net price improvement related to CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. We're not prepared to share our plans for 2024. What I would note is that we'll have, as we've had in the past, a very thoughtful approach that's aligned with long-term sector development in the value that we deliver through our solutions and our innovations, and we'll evaluate and incorporate inflationary dynamics as part of that approach as we get closer to next year. Jay Mazelsky : Yes, just a couple of words about pricing. To Brian's point, from a philosophical standpoint, we want to make sure we continue to deliver really strong value. And we think that our pricing reflects the fact that we continue to do that. We see really very high retention levels in our business. We see an increase in adoption and utilization. So from the standpoint of, I think, customer receptivity, we think our pricing is appropriate given the circumstances. If you think about our latest baby release and reference labs, it's a great example of how we add value that we're increasing the menu. 2 million patients on a global basis, annual global basis are going to benefit from this. We're not increasing the price of those panels. I think it's just a great example of how we try to keep that value equation appropriately aligned to what our customers need. In terms of corporate versus independent practices, a couple of dynamics to keep in mind. Largely, we don't see big differences, obviously there's differences in things like the size of the practice, corporate practices tend to be a bit larger. There are more specialty practices owned by corporates. They're focused, I think, increasingly on growth. We've seen nice interest, not just in our solutions, like in-clinic premium analyzers, but also software solutions, as they really try to operate the businesses in a more standardized way. They're interested in the same type of diagnostic solutions that independent practices are. We see a lot of interest in things like preventive care, for example, because it's a great way of, I think, continuing to engage pet owners and clients, really uncover, I think, a disease that may be otherwise subclinical or hidden that drives the medical services' envelopes. Very similar profiles between the two with some small differences that I just mentioned. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you so much. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. The floor is yours. Michael Ryskin : Great, thanks for taking the question. Two quick ones for me. First, could you expand a little bit on what you saw in a quarter between wellness and clinical and especially as it touches on preventive care in the United States? Just wondering if you're starting to see, or if you are seeing any separation there, just given the price increases between last year and this year, and just thinking about wellness to spend, consumer sensitivity, if you're seeing any impact on demand from that side of things. And then have a follow up. Jay Mazelsky : Yes, good morning, Mike. It's not unusual to see some variability in a given quarter between wellness and let's say non-wellness or sick patient visits. When you take a look at Q2, on a two-year basis, they were very similar growth profiles between the two. So it's small things that can account for some variability, whether more people are traveling, whether, what have you. What we tend to look at is we tend to look at those diagnostic parameters or menu that are used in wellness areas like 40x plus, for example. And that was very strong growth. So we really haven't seen any drop-off. Michael Ryskin : Okay, all right, thanks, that's helpful. And then this is a little bit of looking ahead to 3Q, but just focusing specifically on international and Europe in particular. I know in prior years, you guys have seen occasionally a little bit of a headwind from weather, from extreme weather events, whether it's heat waves or hurricanes, et cetera, just because it would impact pet owner behavior or ability or willingness to visit the clinics, things like that. Just thinking about the heat wave in Europe that's been going on for the last month or so. Is that factoring to your guidance at all? Are you anticipating a little bit of an impact on revenues? I know you called out a day's impact on mothering. If there's any other wiggle room built in there for just the extreme weather, thanks. Brian McKeon : Yes, Mike, I think weather at times can have impact in the business. Our outlook that I mentioned was that for Q3 was organic revenue growth at the lower end of our full year outlook range. And that basically aligns with consistent, strong execution trends and adjustments for the day's effects and just obviously our pricing's evolving a bit here as well. So just compared to H1, so it's a targeting, consistent, strong execution and we'll address those types of impacts if they occur in the businesses and report on that if that turns out to be a factor. Michael Ryskin : All right, thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Please go ahead. Ryan Daniels : Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to dive into the expansion of the U.S. customer facing organization a little bit more. I know it's been a while and you've been more focused on OUS expansion. So can you talk a little bit about, strategically what drove that? Is it just new clinic openings? Are you seeing more opportunities to visit vets? Is it kind of a competitive opening? Just any color there would be helpful. Jay Mazelsky : Sure. So we've grown significantly in the U.S. over the last -- years. I think it's been over three years since we did last expansion. We're very optimistic about the long-term growth prospects of the U.S. It's our largest market. It's something that we really evaluate on an ongoing basis. We want to make sure that we have the right account coverage and we'll be able to, we're able to support, product and innovation priorities over time. So we felt that it made sense. Really just comes down to that. Ryan Daniels : Okay, great. And then it's been a while since you've talked about a new big corporate win. And I'm curious if you could talk about maybe the competitive environment more broadly, post some M&A activity in your space. Are you seeing that open up any opportunities or just normal course of business or more innovation? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yes, I mean, I think the, it's really normal course of business. We do very well with corporates. We occasionally talk about it, but from a corporate account standpoint, I think they see, increasingly see the integrated benefits of multi-modality solution and software. They're focused on workflow and they're focused on productivity, given the capacity constraints and the need to really operate these models. And I think from a solution standpoint, they appreciate what we're able to bring. We have a footprint that's obviously very broad and deep and can work, can partner with them wherever they are. So I think it's a very natural fit from that standpoint. Ryan Daniels : Great, thank you. Operator : We'll move to our next question from John Block with Stifel. Please go ahead. Jonathan Block : Thanks guys and good morning. I'll break up my questions. Brian, it seems like the visits are expected to get a bit better in the second half of '23. I think if I had it right, you mentioned flattish, give or take year over year, but 2Q, '23 was down from the 1Q, '23 level. So maybe if you can elaborate a little bit on what helps the 2H, '23 visits from those first half levels, we did some work around labor constraints that might be easing a bit, but we love your thoughts on the improvement in 2H, \u201823. And then do we think about that trend line arguably continuing into 2024? And then I'll ask my follow up. Brian McKeon : Yes, thanks John for your question. I think the A part of it is working through this effect we saw in 2022 where there was a pullback in capacity. And so I think the pullback was largely happening in the first half of 2022. And so we knew we'd still be working through some of that. And I think that there'll be some relative improvement which I think you were pointing out. And I think overall we anticipate that we continue to look at the growth in demand that we see in terms of the expansion of the pet population and increased interest in pet health care that being affirmed on a lot of the qualitative work that we do believe that there's underserved demand and believe that that will be a positive tailwind over the long-term continue to feel that's very much part of the growth build that we have for the long-term. And we're working through some dynamics here to help clinics adapted to that and improved their productivity. And I think we can be helpful. So I think our long-term optimism is intact. That should be a positive drive over time. And we've made some positive transitions here in their first part of this year. I'd also highlight sometimes we spend a lot of time on the U.S. trends that internationally we've seen relatively more kind of same-store headwind effect that we've been able to offset with our benefits from our business expansion and engagement and invasions that we're bringing. And I think internationally we see the same kind of a story that over time that there's very strong demand for pet healthcare and it's probably relatively greater macro impacts in the near term. But we think that over time that will improve as well. Jonathan Block : Got it, that was a very helpful thing for that. And maybe just a pivot to innovation. When I look back to set of you I believe there was a staggered launch with the U.S. leading and then international following. Any color on how we think of those pending new systems will we see sort of the same approach play out you know, the staggered call it. And then I don't know if you've talked about this before but will the manufacturing be handled by yourself or your partners on those new systems? And just sorry, a quick clarifying question. Brian, I think price in the quarter if I got you right was closer to 9% for Q2 but is full year 2023 price still expected to be between 7 to 8. Thanks guys. Brian McKeon : I'll let Jay dive into the platforms on your latter question. Yes, that's correct. That's what we said. Jay Mazelsky : Yes, so from a platform standpoint I'm obviously not going to talk about it until we talk about it and get closer to the launch. What I will say, John, from a premium instrument placement and how we think about the opportunity. We typically do start with the U.S. market but there's nothing that says we have to do that. The key is really to build an installed base and get that consumable revenue stream moving. That takes time. I think set of U.S. was one example and we launched it seven plus years ago and we built the installed base and we have a nice profile. So we really focus on being able to really drive sector development and adoption and solve those critical problems and everything else takes care of itself from there. Jonathan Block : Thanks, guys. Jay Mazelsky : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. David Westenberg : Hi, thank you for taking the questions and congrats on continued strong execution here. So just a quick question again on that theme of pricing. I know that's one a lot of people talk about but maybe more on the clinic level as we see continued constraints in labor and that's really what we're seeing. Are you seeing pressure from your customers to raise prices themselves? And do you think that's going to continue for say maybe the next six months or so? And do you see any kind of potential to maybe ease in volume as their prices go up or is it equilibrium as because maybe labor is used in a more optimal way? And then just a second to really clarifying short questions. Can you say how many territories you actually added? And then just on the gross margin commentary, you said was it 18 million in terms of what the contribution was because of hedge gains? I'm just trying to make a sense of the 100 basis points of gross margin expansion. Thank you. Jay Mazelsky : That's a quite a different question today. Let me just start with the pricing piece. Obviously clinics control that. If you go back the last five or six quarters, a lot of clinics took multiple price increases on an annual basis. They typically, if you go pre-pandemic or pre-inflationary times, they would increase their prices eight, one time per year. I think a number of clinics on average increase at least two, in some cases three. And that was really just to reflect the higher costs of labor and retaining staff. And in some cases, they needed to add to staff. And so from an employment level standpoint, we think clinics are catching up or caught up. They've hired people. That's not to say they're all working 40 hour weeks. And so in terms of pricing going forward, I think that's really just a reflection of what happens in the economy. At this point, it appears that inflation has moderated somewhat, but we'll have to see how that plays out. And I think they'll make decisions based on how their businesses are doing. Right now, I think clinic revenue, practice revenue is pretty healthy for approaching 6% or so. So I think they feel like they're in a pretty good place from an economic standpoint. Brian McKeon : And Dave, to your questions on gross margin and hedge gains, what we were trying to highlight is terms of our year-over-year performance on margins that there is an effect from in 2022 as the dollar was strengthening, we hedge out, we tend to hedge in advance of the year to help us with our planning. And we had, in the second half of last year, eight to recognize the benefit from $18 million in hedge gains. So what's happened with the foreign exchange dynamics is they've actually moved into a positive zone. So we have some benefit on revenue, but we're going to have some reported year-on-year foreign exchange headwinds. We estimated 70-80 basis points in H2 that relate to just lapping those hedge gains that are roll off eventually. So just trying to highlight that as a factor. We try to, each quarter, note what those gains or losses are, so you have that, and that's in our disclosures as well. So, but just wanted to highlight that as you're to understand kind of the outlook. David Westenberg : Thank you for taking my long question. Operator : Our last question comes from Balaji Prasad, with Barclays, please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Micaela on for Balaji. Thanks for taking our questions. Can you talk about anything particular you saw in the quarter that drove the two-year stocked growth deceleration in CAG recurring? Thank you so much. Brian McKeon : [So, a] question. Jay Mazelsky : Anything that drove the, it was a question, anything that drove the two-year stack CAG diagnostics recurring revenue growth? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Jay Mazelsky : Okay, yes, I mean, as we had a very strong quarter in terms of CAG diagnostics, recurrent revenue as indicated. Yes, it was really in part driven by pricing as well as volume growth and just really good execution. So, attention of customers was very good. We saw adoption and utilization of diagnostics really across our broad spectrum. Obviously, consumables in our in-clinic business was very, very strong, and we saw nice performance in international, but that's really more of a cumulative impact of placements that we've, I think achieved over the last, [4-6] quarters. Brian McKeon : Yes, I'd highlight the two-year, I'm just looking at the numbers on a two-year basis. We were relatively consistent performance. He won in Q2, so I think we had similar trends, similar benefits, and as Jay highlighted, I think we've had very good execution, including some benefits from the higher pricing this year. Jay Mazelsky : Okay, so with that, we'll conclude the Q&A portion of the call this morning. Thanks for everyone on the phone for your participation. This morning, it's an honor to share another quarter of solid financial and strategic results as we continue to address this significant long-term opportunity to enhance standards of care for companion animals who are on wavering focus on diagnostic insights. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Hope to see you all at investor day, and thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the IDEXX Laboratories Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Participating in the call this morning are Jay Mazelsky, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian McKeon, Chief Financial Officer; and John Ravis, Vice President, Investor Relations. IDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements. Listeners are reminded that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the forward-looking statements noticed in our press release issued this morning, as well as in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website, idexx.com. During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures, not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable measures are provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. In reviewing our third quarter 2023 results, please note all references to growth, organic growth, and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent period in 2022, unless otherwise noted. [Operator Instructions]. Today's prepared remarks will be posted to the Investor Relations section of idexx.com after the earnings conference call concludes. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today I'll take you through our Q3 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2023. In terms of highlights, IDEXX achieved solid revenue growth and strong profit gains in the third quarter. Overall revenues increased 8% organically, supported by 9% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues net of approximately 50 basis points of negative impact from fewer equivalent selling days.  Organic revenue growth was supported by sustained benefits from IDEXX execution drivers including continued strong premium instrument replacements, solid new business gains, high levels of customer retention and high growth in recurring veterinary software revenues.  Overall CAG diagnostics recurring revenue gains in the quarter were moderated by a 2% same-store decline in US clinical business. This was below our expectations for relatively flattening US clinic visit trends, reflecting ongoing capacity management challenges at US clinics and relatively softer wellness visit levels. Operating profit results were ahead of our expectations supported by gross margin gains and operating expense leverage, which enabled EPS delivery of $2.53 per share, up 18% as reported and 16% on a comparable basis. Based on our strong financial results in the quarter, we're updating our full year EPS outlook aligned with the higher end of our previous guidance range.  This reflects expectations for strong comparable operating margin gains this year. We're also updating our full year revenue guidance ranges to incorporate our Q3 results and recent sector trends, as well as to reflect the recent strengthening of the US dollar. We will review our updated guidance detail later in my comments.  Let's begin with the review of our third quarter results. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 8% was driven by 8% organic CAG gains and 7% organic growth in our Water business. Overall, organic revenue growth was moderated by 2% organic growth in our LPD business and approximately $3 million of headwind related to lower opti medical revenues including effects from the wind down of our human COVID testing business.  CAG diagnostic recurring revenue increased 9% organically, reflecting 8.3% gains in the US and 10.3% growth in international regions net of a 0.5% global growth headwind from equivalent days effects. CAG diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth in Q3 was supported by average global net price improvement of approximately 7%, in line with our expectations for 6% to 7% gains in the second half of the year.  Overall, organic revenue growth was supported by 13% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues, driven by continued strong gains in recurring software revenues. GAC instrument revenues were down 10% organically, reflecting comparisons to high priority levels, program pricing effects and global mix.  IDEXX CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth remains solidly above sector growth levels. In the US, CAG diagnostic recurring revenue organic growth was 8.3%, including approximately 50 basis points of negative impact from fewer selling days in Q3. This reflects an approximately 1100 basis point normalized growth premium, compared to same-store US clinic visit growth levels, which declined an estimated 2% overall in the quarter.  IDEXX\u2019s growth results reflect continued increases in diagnostic frequency and utilization per clinical visit at the practice level. Instrument benefits from IDEXX execution drivers, including higher net price realization, solid new business gains, and sustained high customer retention levels.  As noted, same-store US clinic visit declines of 2% were below our expectations for relatively flat clinic visit growth in the second half of 2023. Software trends in Q3 a period of an impacted by ongoing capacity management challenges at US clinics, including effects from high staff turnover. We also saw a relative slow down in wellness visits in the quarter, which may reflect some macro impacts on demand at the clinic level.  We refined our full year revenue outlook to capture potential impacts from these trends in Q4, while reinforcing our strong outlook for 2023 profit performance. IDEXX international CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 10.3% in Q3, reflecting continued benefits from higher net price realization, and improved volume gains.  International results were also supported by strong IDEXX execution, reflected and sustained new business gains and high Q3 premium instrument replacements, which supported a double-digit expansion of our premium instrument installed base. Double-digit growth rate benefits from IDEXX execution offset negative impacts from international macro conditions, which continue to pressure same-store volume growth trends in the quarter.  Globally Q3 results were supported by strong growth of IDEXX in-clinic CAG diagnostic recurring revenues. IDEXX VETLAB consumer revenues increased 11% organically with double digit gains in US and international regions. Consumer gains were supported by 11% year-on-year growth at our global premium instrument installed base, reflecting strong gains across our catalyst, premium hematology and set-of-you platforms. We placed 4,571 CAG premium instruments in Q3, a decrease of 4% year-on-year, compared to record prior year levels, which included benefits from our international launch of ProCyte One. The quality of instrument replacements continues to be excellent reflected in solid global gains in EVI metrics and sustained high new and competitive catalyst placements in the US. Global catalyst placements decreased 2% overall reflecting tough comparisons to high prior year international placement levels.  ProCyte One installed base expansion continued at a solid pace reflected in a global installed base of over 12,000 instruments. Global Rapid Assay revenues expanded 8% organically in Q3, supported by strong growth in the U.S., including benefits from higher net price realization. Global lab revenues increased 7% organically, reflecting high single-digit gains in the U.S. and relatively improved mid-to-high single-digit growth in International regions. In other areas of our CAG business, Veterinary Software and Diagnostic Imaging revenues increased 13% organically. Results were supported by continued high levels of organic growth in recurring software and diagnostic imaging revenues and ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. Water revenues increased 7% organically in Q3, compared to strong prior year growth levels. Growth was driven by continued solid gains in the U.S., including benefits from net price improvement. Our Tecta-PDS acquisition integration continues to progress well and added 1% to reported Water growth. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues increased 2% organically, as strong gains in the U.S. continue to be moderated by constraints on International growth, including impacts from lower herd health screening revenues related to reduced China import testing. Turning to the P&L, Q3 profit results were supported by high comparable operating margin gains, including benefits from operating expense leverage. Gross profit increased 8% in the quarter as reported and on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 59.9%, up 30 basis points on a comparable basis, compared to strong prior year levels.  Gross margin gains reflected benefits from higher net price realization, business mix and improvement in software service gross margins. As expected, reported gross margin gains were moderated by a 60-basis point negative impact related to FX, driven by the lapping of prior year hedge gains. We're projecting an approximate 70 basis point gross margin headwind in Q4 related to FX, again primarily related to the lapping of prior year hedge gains. On a reported basis, operating expenses increased 4% year-on-year as reported and on a comparable basis, reflecting benefits from cost controls and lapping of prior year R&D and commercial investments. We're planning for a higher level of OpEx growth in Q4 as we advance our U.S. commercial expansion and increased R&D investments aligned with our innovation initiatives, including our planned 2024 new platform launch. EPS was $2.53 per share in Q3, an increase of 18% as reported and 16% on a comparable basis. Foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $1 million and EPS by $0.01 per share in the quarter, including impacts from the lapping of $9 million in prior year hedge gains. Impacts from 2023 foreign exchange hedges resulted in a $1 million gain in the quarter. Free cash flow was $238 million in the third quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to FCF conversion ratio was 83%. For the full year, we're updating our outlook for free cash flow conversion to 85% to 90% of net income at the higher end of our earlier projections reflecting estimated capital spending of $160 to $180 million. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 0.8x gross and 0.6x net of cash. Share repurchases over the last year supported a 0.1% reduction in diluted shares outstanding for the quarter. We allocated $35 million in capital to share repurchases in the third quarter, as we continue to manage our balance sheet relatively more conservatively in the current interest rate environment. Turning to our 2023 P&L guidance, we're updating our full-year outlook to incorporate our Q3 results and revised estimates for foreign exchange impacts, reflecting the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our updated full-year guidance for reported revenues is $3,635 million to $3,650 million, reflecting a 7.9% to 8.4% reported growth range.  The updated reported revenue outlook includes a $20 million reduction for FX impacts, compared to prior estimates. We now estimate FX will reduce full-year reported growth by approximately 0.5%, with limited year-on-year revenue growth effects in Q4. In terms of our operational revenue growth outlook, we are updating our full-year organic growth guidance to 8.3% to 8.8%, supported by an outlook for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue organic growth of 9.8% to 10.3%. This aligns with the lower end of our most recent guidance ranges in the midpoint of our original outlook for 2023.  Our organic growth guidance assumes a level of continued pressure on U.S. same-store clinical visits and International same-store sales levels in Q4 reflecting ongoing clinic capacity management dynamics and macro-economic impacts on demand.  Consistent with earlier guidance our outlook for CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth reflects continued solid, positive benefits from IDEXX execution drivers, including consistent expectations for 6% to 7% net price improvement in the second half of 2023.  In Q4, we expect global net price improvement within this range, with U.S. net price gains of 6%, reflecting the lapping of prior year price increases. Our Q4 outlook also incorporates a 1% equivalent day volume growth headwind. We're maintaining the high end of our reported EPS outlook and narrowing the full-year EPS guidance range to $9.74 to $9.90 per share, an increase of $0.05 per share at midpoint. At midpoint we're maintaining a consistent operational EPS outlook, as revisions to our organic revenue growth range are offset by positive adjustments to our projections for operating margins incorporating our strong year-to-date performance.  We've increased the outlook for reported operating margins to 29.6% to 29.8% for the full year. This reflects an outlook for 360 to 380 basis points in comparable operating margin expansion, including approximately 280 basis points in combined benefit from the $16 million Q1 customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of $80 million of discrete R&D investment in the second quarter of 2022. Our updated full year EPS guidance incorporates $0.11 per share in positive revisions combined to our interest expense and tax rate outlook including $0.04 in upsides related to share based compensation tax benefits. These gains are partially offset by $0.05 of negative impact from foreign exchange changes at updated rates.  We now estimate that foreign exchange impacts will decrease EPS by $0.25 per share for the full year and will reduce reported full year operating margins by 70 basis points including impacts from the lapping of $26 million in 2022 hedge gains. We've provided details on our updated 2023 outlook in the press release tables and earnings snapshots. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Jay Mazelsky : Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX continued to make excellent progress in advancing our business strategy in Q3, while delivering solid organic revenue growth and strong financial performance. Our strategy of high-touch commercial engagement, supported by relevant testing and workflow innovations, drove continued adoption of IDEXX\u2019s world-class products and services. IDEXX solutions support our customer's mission to deliver high standards of care, enabled through the continued expansion of diagnostics frequency and utilization at the practice level. Diagnostics revenue remains the fastest growing area of veterinary clinic revenues, a durable trend since the determination of a patient's health status and the best treatment path very often requires testing. IDEXX\u2019s strong financial performance in Q3 was supported by solid gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues across our major regions. The expansion of recurring revenues benefit from multiple IDEXX execution drivers, including solid placements of premium instruments building off high prior year levels, sustained new business gains, net price realization, and continued momentum in placements of cloud-based software solutions.  These gains are offsetting near-term headwinds in overall clinic visit levels globally reflecting ongoing capacity management challenges at veterinary practices, as well as impacts from macroeconomic dynamics. Productivity remains a top priority for veterinary clinics, who continue to refine their business approach and make trade-offs necessary to balance staffing management challenges with strong demand for medical services.  IDEXX\u2019s solutions anchored by our software-enabled multi-modality offering give clinics the tools to address these dynamics. Today, I\u2019ll review how we're advancing our strategy focused on developing the significant long-term growth opportunity for our business, while delivering strong financial performance. I\u2019ll start with an update on our global commercial performance and how our focus on customer engagement supports the increase in adoption and utilization of diagnostics. IDEXX commercial teams are highly engaged in a customer-centric model that supports both existing customers' use of diagnostics and expanding our customer base. Our commercial professionals delivered another excellent quarter of results in Q3. Solid CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue reflects benefits from our expanding loyal installed base and our veterinary partnership model to communicate the importance of diagnostics to clinicians.  It also reflects benefits from our focus on placing high value analyzers at existing and competitive accounts in order to drive profitable future recurring revenues including 5% competitive Catalyst placement growth in North America, which supported solid EVI growth. Our continued progress on this front reflects a relentless focus on providing busy clinicians with the products, services, and the support they need to serve the high demand for veterinary services and meet the expectations of pet owners who seek and increasingly demand no compromises in the care for their pets. In addition to driving the core growth in medical services in the clinic, diagnostics are also a key profit center. Continued growth in both diagnostics frequency and utilization per clinical visit was supported by gains in wellness testing per visit, building on substantial increases through the pandemic. This demonstrates that veterinarians continue to incorporate and expand the use of diagnostics in their care protocols while pet owners continue to show willingness to spend on their pets.  This focus supported solid 7% gains in same-store diagnostic revenue gain at the practice level growth that is being achieved despite ongoing headwinds in clinical visit growth in a resource constrained and challenging macro environment. This performance shows that pet owners continue to prioritize healthcare for their pets, which reinforces the resiliency of our sector. And IDEXX customers are growing even faster supported by our direct customer engagement model and superior, integrated diagnostic solutions. IDEXX\u2019s experienced sales professionals\u2019 deep partnership with the veterinarians they serve supported sector diagnostic revenue growth that outpaced both practice revenue and clinical revenue growth by 200 plus basis points in Q3 building on our strong momentum in helping to advance pet healthcare through diagnostics testing. Growing our commercial footprint in a disciplined way is a key element of our customer engagement strategy. As we shared at Investor Day, extensive practice data analysis shows that customers using our broader diagnostics offering generate approximately 200 basis points higher practice clinical and diagnostics revenue growth consistent with our execution trends. This benefits the patient, practice economics and, by extension, IDEXX.  Our U.S. commercial expansion is progressing to plan, and we expect to enter the New Year with the expanded team in place. This is the first U.S. expansion in four years, and many territories have appreciably increased in size since then. Increasing reach and engagement with clinics in our largest and most developed region prepares us well to support the growing portfolio of IDEXX innovations. Outside of the U.S., we remain focused on deploying our commercial playbook in countries across the world and are encouraged to report that third quarter International CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues benefited from another quarter of improving volume growth. Higher reach-to-revenue metrics strengthen relationships between IDEXX commercial professionals and in-region veterinarians.  Our increased commercial presence as a result of seven international commercial expansions since 2020 helped drive solid double-digit year-over-year gains in our international premium instrument installed base across platforms. This includes record third quarter instrument placements in the Asia-Pacific region which helped drive 13% growth in our international installed base.  This growth demonstrates that our highly capable sales teams have the right products at the right time and reinforces significant potential associated with the development of international regions. These geographies represent an outsized portion of our long-term opportunity of over 200,000 incremental premium placements for existing instrument categories. Turning to our innovation agenda, software is a key pillar in our growth strategy and an area of important focus in the clinic, a trend that we are well positioned to facilitate and enable. Clinics are embracing software to improve efficiency in all aspects of their business, from patient processing and billing to diagnostics interpretation and pet owner communication.  Higher software adoption is driven by the desire to realize the benefits of modern technology and applications to address these significant workflow pain points. It also positions practices to incorporate solutions that increase engagement with pet owners through scheduling and other tools that they use and rely on in other aspects of their lives.  The multiplier benefit to our business from the adoption of IDEXX software is significant, reflected in third quarter growth in our software and diagnostic imaging segment with high-teen organic gains in our highly profitable recurring annuity stream. Excellent commercial execution and strong customer interest drove outstanding third quarter PIMS placements. Most notably, our cloud-based PIMS products represented 95% of total PIMS placements and as a result now comprise over 50% of our PIMS installed base. This achievement reflects broad-based adoption of cloud-based products that reflects an inflection point in technology adoption.  While veterinarians earlier in their careers are more digitally native, sales profiles indicate that customers of all career stages appreciate the workflow benefits and ease-of-use of our wide-ranging software stack. The common denominator is that contemporary software solutions allow them to better focus on the delivery of care and minimize non-value add administrative activities. Our software product offering also includes an integrated diagnostics portal, VetConnect PLUS with IDEXX DecisionIQ, that not only provides testing results, but also decision support, clinical insights, and next step considerations across a growing range of clinical use cases.  IDEXX software and data solutions situate us well to benefit from these trends, as well as the accretion in operating margin drop through associated with a revenue base that is increasingly recurring in nature. Our software innovation is deeply integrated with our diagnostics innovation approach as evidenced by our highly successful instrument platform strategy, enabled by cloud-based capabilities and connectivity that enhance practice insight and workflow.  We're very excited about our continued progress in bringing transformative solutions to point of care and we are on plan to announce our new platform at VMX in January. Our product development efforts continue to advance aligned to our timing expectations and we are excited to share more details in just a few short months and how it will add to our over 200,000 placement opportunity estimate for existing instrument categories. We also continue to advance our innovation engine in other areas like advanced test menu. Innovation in assays that provide new clinical insights earlier in disease states is especially valued by veterinarians, since they drive higher standards of care aligned with the goal of improving health outcomes for their patients.  Earlier this year, we announced the launch of an important new testing assay, Cystatin B, that expands our industry leading renal portfolio and will be available in early December beginning with our North American lab networks.  This will be followed by international launches over the course of 2024. This novel marker uses IDEXX IP to help clinicians detect kidney injury earlier and more definitively and is receiving broad support from key opinion leaders. Notably, a recent article in the Journal of Internal Veterinary Medicine, co-authored by multiple International Renal Interest Society members, highlights the beneficial insights in distinguishing progressive from stable kidney disease by detecting active injury. These clinical insights represent important medical contributions and the test will be included in close to 2 million urine panels run at IDEXX reference labs in our first year post launch.  Looking forward, we will announce an additional expansion to our reference lab testing menu in Q1. In addition to these examples of product and service innovation, we continue to advance differentiated service delivery as a key element of our expansion strategy. We made a notable advancement in this area early in the third quarter when we opened our newest reference laboratory in Perth, Western Australia. Perth is an economically vibrant city that is a five-and-a-half-hour flight from our Brisbane laboratory including a two-hour time difference making it particularly difficult to service in the past. The addition of this new lab to our global network ensures customers will receive faster turnaround times for test results, enabling them to make timely and informed decisions for their patients' well-being. IDEXX provides the only veterinary-dedicated and accredited reference laboratory network in Australia and New Zealand, so bringing this location online is an important achievement as we strive to deliver sustainable long-term value.  Expansion of our global reference lab footprint is just one way we are addressing the approximately two-thirds of our estimated TAM opportunity outside of the U.S., an area of focus. With that, I\u2019ll now conclude the prepared remarks portion of the call. Before we move to Q&A, I want to take a moment to express our heartfelt sympathy for everyone affected by the events in Lewiston, Maine last week. We are deeply saddened by the senseless act of violence impacting our communities. Keeping our colleagues safe, supporting each other, and providing health and well-being support is a top priority during this difficult time.  I also want to thank law enforcement and public safety personnel who are working tirelessly to keep our communities safe and medical teams who continue to aid all who have been impacted. Now, let\u2019s open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Moving first to Michael Ryskin of Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Michael Ryskin : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. First, I want to talk about the broader market, I mean, as you said visit trends, as you've said, the pressures remain soft from the numbers in the snapshot relatively consistent with what we expected from third-party data. So not a huge surprise there. But I think it's safe to say that it's the last thing a lot of longer than anyone is expected going into the year.  If this continues without anything that's improvement, how does this impact your long-term model and longer term expectations to the business? Already put another way, you're targeting 8.5% organic growth this year well below your 10%, long-term target and that's despite taking 7% to 8% price. So if pricing power is not there, we're not there to the same extent and volumes don't recover, I mean, what other levers do you have to offset that? Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, good morning Mike. This is Jay. Just a couple things, maybe at a higher level and I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian talk about some of the specifics related to the model. Keep in mind the backdrop of the sector is very positive. It's just been an expanded pet population. I think the human health and pet pop has very, very strong. Our execution drivers as a company the things that you know, we can directly influence have been very strong. We've seen that in instrument placements and in PIMS placements, net retention, pricing realization. So all those things I think are very good. We think there's been very good end-customer demand as we cited. There are some constraints related to practice capacity and some challenges there. I think the good news on that front is the practices have hired their baby some yeah, some additional charts that they're working through, but they're investing heavily and in technology, we see that with the use of our lab equipment, both in-clinic, as well as reference labs. And obviously, the appetite for software and applications that help them with optimized workflow have continued to grow.  And then overall, our competitive position is very strong and we think as a result of our innovation pipeline, we will continue to be strong enough for some differentiated advantages. So, I think from an industry standpoint, it's a very positive story. I think we're well positioned to capitalize on those trends and the practices just continued to work through some of the constraints we cited. Brian McKeon : Yeah, Mike, just to reinforce Jay's points, I think our long-term 10% growth potential, the key drivers that that we look towards we see a lot of positive factors sustaining in terms of our competitive positioning, expansion of diagnostics frequency and utilization. The adoption of IDEXX technology is the long-term demand dynamics that we see associated with expanded population, and favorable demographics in terms of pet ownership.  So, all those factors are positive. I think the thing that we're working through is a combination of near-term capacity management challenges at the clinics. And I think that's something we're assisting with and, and believe we'll have solutions to help with that over time. But that is something that is has continued and I think is a factor impacting near term growth, as well as some of the near term macro impacts.  So I think, as we stated many times in the past, we're a business that's very resilient, but not immune to those types of impacts. And that's something that that I think is also impacting our near-term growth at the margin. But we don't see that either of those factors as being long-term constraints to the growth potential for the company.  And I think from a competitive positioning point of view, we're in a strong position as we've ever been in terms of our ability to support the continued expansion of the sector globally. Michael Ryskin : Okay. All right. And maybe I'll use my follow-up to just be a little bit more direct on \u201824. I know you're not guiding for \u201824. I'm not asking for \u201824 guide. But just looking at where consensus is right now, it is still at that roughly 10% number. Just given what we see about market conditions, as we sit today, I mean, in November, we've already got a pretty good sense of where they are.  Do you think that there's a risk that \u201824 - 2024 is also below that long-term trend line \u2013 that long term model? Jay Mazelsky : We're not going to be guiding obviously today, but I think we've got a number of positive factors that we see heading into next year in terms of our execution. The competitive position that I noted the innovation pipeline that we're looking forward to sharing more on as we move forward. And I think those are all things that we will be leaning on to continue to delivering solid growth and continue delivering strong financial performance, which I think we're demonstrating our ability to do this year. So we'll share more in that front as we get into next year.  We're focusing on the drivers that we have direct impact on and we feel very good about our execution on that front. Michael Ryskin : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Hi, good morning. Can you hear me? Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. Brian McKeon : We do. Jay Mazelsky : Good morning, Nate. Nathan Rich : Great. Hey, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Just wanted to ask about the, the US CAG Diagnostic recurring performance in the third quarter and maybe just if you could go into a little bit more detail on how that played out relative to expectations? Obviously, traffic decelerated during the quarter, but from a diagnostic volume standpoint, I'd wonder if you can maybe, was there anything from a category standpoint that was more challenging than you had expected? And I'll stop there and then maybe ask my follow up next. Brian McKeon : Yeah. The performance in the quarter just to reinforce some of the metrics I shared, and then Jay can expand on this was our execution dimensions were very much in line with what we expected. The difference here was we are planning for flattening clinical visit trends and they were down 2% in the quarter. We did see some softening through the quarter and it was relatively more on the wellness side.  So I think that that was \u2013 that\u2019s a smaller part of the overall testing volume. But that is something that we did see relative impacts, so that that was - it was the visit trend that was different than we had been planning for or hoping for. And the execution metrics held up well and that enabled us to deliver solid growth on a - in terms of the CAG recurring revenues. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, couple additional about comments for - to cover. We always start with PIM customer demand and for what we've seen in the talking with our customers that this good end-market demand certainly pet owners continue to prioritize and against the whole other spending categories, they're bringing their bring their pets to the veterinarian and making sure that they get the care that they need.  The other piece that we've been spending time, looking at is just overall employment levels within the practice and we think that that has increased and that's in a good position. We don't necessarily have insights in terms of how many hours they may be working to put in terms of just availability of staff within practices we think that's been reasonably good shape. We have done some qualitative surveying. There is some additional churn within practices if that goes from practice to practice, that is obviously something that will work its way through the system. Just picking up what Brian mentioned against not to not wellness or sick patient visits versus the wellness visits, if the diagnostics usage on the non-wellness side is higher, it's much higher at 70% or so I think we map that out as part of the Investor Day.  And so, that's, I think an important tailwind for the business. The other thing that I would point out is the, relative frequency and utilization of diagnostics continues to grow within the practice we've seen that in the US, we think that's a very positive trend. Obviously, veterinarians see the importance of core medical services and to be able to treat a patient they very often have done the first test.  So it's great to see that those trends have held up and continue to grow and we think that's a strong positive. Nathan Rich : And if I could just ask on margins, I guess, if you see sort of the visit pressure persist, just the ability to kind of grow margins in line with the kind of 50 to 100 basis point kind of constant currency range into next year, if you do see an overall kind of softer top-line environment, just, I'm curious on kind of how much kind of leverage - how much of the margin expansion is dependent on that, that top-line growth? Thank you. Jay Mazelsky : I think we've been consistently demonstrating our ability to perform well in that front in despite some of the headwinds that we've seen this year. So I think our updated outlook for margins if you take out the, if you normalize for the customer credit that we've highlighted, as well as the lapping of R&D and foreign exchange, we're most recent guidance is to be 80 to 100 BPS above the prior year. And that's despite some of the headwinds that we've seen this year. So, we've consistently demonstrated the ability to deliver to business model, which we have a number of favorable dynamics that support that we highlighted the strong growth in the software business as it is a positive driver force as we grow and I think we've got investments that we can leverage. And we've got new innovation coming to market.  So a number of factors that I think will help us and positions well to keep building on that's strong margin delivery trends. Nathan Rich : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will move next to Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Erin Wright : Hey, thanks. Has there been any early testing on the new platform you plan to launch at BMX? And if so, like what's the initial feedback and on the second platform technology, is that on track as we'll both roll out in 2024 or will both have material contributions in 2024? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. Good morning, Erin. I am not going to talk about the new platform other than just to reiterate we are looking forward is just a couple months away from BMX and we can talk more about that. More generally speaking the way the new product development process works is, you develop prototypes, you put it in hands of customers, they provide feedback and it goes through an additive process, you get ready to go to marketplace.  So we're excited. We think it's a - we think it's a platform that will make will have the right clinical and business contribution, but really I can't go into additional details beyond that. Erin Wright : Okay. And, thinking about \u2013 I know this is kind of a broader question, just thinking about the competitive landscape and you have this unique positioning now seeing lessened comfort than your closest peers in both point-of-care and reference lab, particularly in the US. I guess, can you talk a little bit more about your ability to take share?  Could this accelerate particularly with also new innovation, but with any disruption associated with the other models of your peers? And how are you capitalizing on this now? And how are you taking advantage of maybe the competitive landscape where it stands today? Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, so, a couple maybe high level points and I'll get more specific. Our strategic and innovation approach is really to bring an integrated solution set to the marketplace. So that's in clinic, as well as reference lab, and the connectivity and workflow optimization provided by our software suite, we think is highly differentiated. It supports what the practices are trying to accomplish in terms of improved standards of care, optimizations of staff productivity, client communications, all of those important things and we continue to innovate through menu expansion and then more specifically, new platforms. And new platforms, it's an important component of our business model in terms of really being able to give our customers reference lab quality testing capability within the practice.  We place it, we tend to place these through marketing programs. IDEXX360 being the primary one customers are able to get that get that placement then you use reference labs or rapid assay or our Software-as-a-Service based PIMS systems, as part of our dollar volume commitment. So there's a significant multiplier impact when you come out with new innovations. And we just continue to build it through what technology for life philosophy. So we have existing platforms on the marketplace. We will continue to innovate with new slides, for example in chemistry or lots and lots of other examples.  We call antigen within the reference labs. So that becomes more valuable clinically over time and customers use more of it as they grow, we grow. Operator : We\u2019ll move next to Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much. Just had two questions for me. I guess, just coming back to the dynamics with the visit trends that we're seeing versus your expectations, is it possible to tease out how much of what you're seeing right now is macro versus how much is capacity?  So, as I'm showing my hands around, is this a situation where we're right now seeing some macro pressures and capacity just isn't getting better relative to where maybe you stood at mid-year or are we also seeing some setbacks on the vet capacity side as well as we think about the updated guidance? And then I just have one follow-up from there. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. Good morning, Chris. We think it's primarily capacity, it continues to be capacity. I think practices are definitely working through that. We've seen a number of things that practices have done. And the - it takes time. I mean they're making investments. So I think they're investing in their staff, as well as technology, they've hired. They're also just trying to balance the work life balance of their teams, so that they don't lose folks and make sure that it could be stabilized. So I think that's important. We do think at the margin there could be some macro impacts than we've seen in wellness. And I would just also point out that the wellness pieces are relatively lower use intensity-wise of diagnostics.  70% of diagnostic, 70 plus percent of diagnostics are consumed through non-wellness or the sick patient visits. Brian McKeon : And Chris, just it's a, it's a great question. I think we've always said that the \u2013 in terms of macro where we might see it is on the wellness side where that may be more of a discretionary choice for the pet owner. Interestingly, well, the visits were down in wellness quarter frequency and utilization of diagnostics per wellness as it was up actually stronger than non-wellness.  So, for the pet owners that are able to come in and get their pets in, they're actually doing more diagnostics testing, but overall, we saw lower levels of wellness visits. So it doesn't had probably comingled into some of the dynamics that are going on with capacity management. And there may be a level of impact there.  We have seen that in international markets that we've been highlighting as we go. And so it's something that we're paying attention for. We're planning appropriately for it, but I think it's as Jay pointed out. I think - we think this is continues to be more of an impact from the ongoing ability of the practices to staff and be able to manage the demand that they're facing. Chris Schott : Okay. Great. Thanks guys. And just a second question was just I think you mentioned a little bit about US versus international. Could you just kind of bigger picture, are you seeing noticeable differences in terms of what's happening in the US versus in the pure international markets? And just, as part of that, is this guidance update, kind of assuming a global impact in terms of visit slowdowns? Or is this skewing more US versus international? Thank you. Brian McKeon : We definitely saw more of an impact internationally on from macro pressures really starting at the end of 2021. And I would say that that has normalized over time and it\u2019s now relatively more in line with the US trends. We've done quite well internationally. We're doing - benefiting from our premium instrument installed base expansions, so that really helps our growth rate.  And we highlighted this quarter, we've seen actually for a few quarters now relative improvement in the volume trends. So, I think the - it's more in line I think with what we're seeing and started some of the US pressures more recently. And it does seem to be normalizing and relatively improving. You can see that in some of the international metrics things like with our reference lab growth was improved in Q3.  So that's a positive trend and we're just being realistic about the macro backdrop that we're facing and planning appropriately. Jay Mazelsky : And keep in mind, the international sectors just a bit different in terms of its overall characteristics. It tends to be more of a sick patient roll out testing approach from a veterinary practice standpoint. So, obviously, that that's an area of richer diagnostics usage scenario, less sensitive to some of the discretionary spend that you may see in a difficult macro environment. So, as Brian said, we're happy with our progress and continues to improve we think that the team is executing extremely well, and the opportunity over time is very substantial. Chris Schott : Thank you. Operator : Well go next to John Block with Stifel. Your line is open. Please go ahead. John Block : Thanks guys. Good morning. Brian, maybe just to start with you. The 3Q \u201823 sales and marketing expense was down by 3% to 4% Q-over-Q. I've got usually like flat to slightly up 2Q two to 3Q. And this year's decline was despite ongoing increases that you guys have called out on the commercial investment.  So, I don\u2019t know, I'm guessing aspects may have played a little bit of a role Q-over-Q this year in 2023, but anything to highlight on what costs you were able to take out in the S&M side that drove the sequential decline? What you were able to do or lean on even in light of the commercial investments that seem to be ongoing through the end of the year? Brian McKeon : Yeah, John. It's principally a lapping dynamic. We - last year in Q3 had some relatively higher sales and bidding costs. Specifically, there's some discreet costs on both the sales and marketing and the R&D side that we\u2019re lapping. And so, it - as I noted in our outlook, we're expecting a relatively higher level of OpEx growth in Q4. So it it's more related to this year-on-year specific factor dynamic. John Block : Okay. Sorry. Just my question was sequentially not year-over-year. So my apologies. The 2Q to 3Q was down 3% to 4%. It's usually up 1%. You're making commercial investments. I guess what I'm \u2013 just trying to get a little bit is like managing the bottom-line in the near-term and getting the EPS and we're exceeding the EPS number. Were there anything in sales and marketing that you scale back on in light of the lighter revenue number? Again, Q-over-Q, no. Brian McKeon : No, you have - there's typically some variation and cost quarter-to-quarter that that are unrelated to things like staffing. So we haven't scaled back on anything. John Block : Okay. And then, maybe just to shift to your second question. I'm going to show my age and flashback to set of you, initially you guys expected, I think it was three to six thousand in consumable revenue per box on set of you. I get it a couple quarters in that forecast came down at 3,000 to 4,500, maybe you can just talk about how that eventually shook out, as that product cycle matured?  And in any comments on the IDEXX in view trademark, which hit last week, it seems like to us that's probably the BMX analyzer and then how to think about the revs per box on the new system. Thanks. Brian McKeon : So on set of you, if I got your question right, the the utilization per placement played out actually quite very much in line with what we expected. So I think we haven\u2019t updated that for a bit, but I think that that was tracked consistently in line with our original estimate since sustained over time. So I think that that has been on track to our estimates.  And it's, it's pretty much sure for us to get into the specifics on the, on the new instrument launch. We'll look forward to sharing more on that next year. Just to reinforce, these, as you know, these types of platforms build over time really the biggest effects from them are that they open the door for conversation with veterinarians to talk about IDEXX technology and innovations and adopt them in their practice.  And so we're very excited about building on the momentum when we had from ProCyte One to continue those dialogues and deepen our relationships with our customers help them grow faster. And we'll share more on the specifics relating to new innovations as we get into next year. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, John, the other thing that I would add to that is, I think we shared some data through went up like Ericson presented on the evolution of menu and how that that impacts the overall economic value over time. And our technology for life approach where we come \u2013 we come out to the marketplace. We introduce product obviously. The installed base grows over time. But as we continue to add menu and improve that, more revenue, more economics are generated. And we've been able to demonstrate that through our platforms including the reference labs. John Block : Thank you. Operator : And we'll move next to Brandon Vasquez with William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brandon Vasquez : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. First one maybe just follow-up maybe ask on some of the headwinds in the quarter slightly different there's wellness and there's a little bit of labor. The question I want to ask is, are those getting, are they deteriorating are those headwinds increasing as we go into the end of the year? I guess, I'm trying to ask for a little clarification, are things stable, maybe just not improving as much as we thought? Or are we going into year end with those two dynamics kind of worsening a little bit? Brian McKeon : I think it the key change here relative to what we expected to happen in the quarter was, we're looking for flattening visit trends in the US, and they came in at minus 2%. So if you go fundamentally, it was different than what we expected, that's it. But I think our execution was strong and all those dimensions going to play the way that we had hoped. The clinic - US clinical visit trends were minus 1% in Q2 - excuse me, in Q2, and minus 2% in Q3 on a two year basis. They're pretty similar. I think it's a, we did see some relative softening through the quarter. Some relative relatively weaker wellness clinical visit trends, more at the margin I think the bigger, bigger story here was, we had hoped that we had worked through the pullback effects on capacity. And we see some normalization there and I think we're still working through some of the management dynamics. So that that is very much reflected in our or balance year outlook that we've calibrated for that appropriately while we're reinforcing our profit delivery. So I think we're able to manage that well and teams are executing very well. And then again excited about a number of the things that we've got going into next year relative to our positioning as a company and new innovation bringing a market. And look forward to continuing to solid growth in that context. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, and keep in mind, the expanded pet population has been very, very substantial. So, we know that the end-customer demand is there. There is a lot of interest I think that to Brian\u2019s point as we work through that capacity at the clinic level. There's unmet unserved demand out there. Brandon Vasquez : Okay, great. And maybe as a follow-up, you guys are expanding US sales force now that seems on track as we go into \u201924. Can you just talk about expectations? How long does it take to get those new reps trained? You'll probably also have a new innovative product for them next year a new system. So what's the timeline to kind of start seeing leverage both sales and kind of margin benefits from the expanded sales force? Thank you. Jay Mazelsky : This is something that we've been we've been doing for a long time. I think we have a very successful formula in terms of how we how we expand the overall commercial ecosystem and footprint in North America. It tends to be a relatively short time to ramp. We have I think a - protective training approach and when we bring new folks into the system, they're well trained. And they really come up to speed within quarters.  Now they continue to become more productive over time, but this they get a lot of support through professional service vets and the field service representatives. The entire ecosystem is there to support them.  Okay. Thank you for your questions. We'll not conclude our Q&A portion of this morning's call. before we end today's call. I'd like to extend my thanks to the nearly 11,000 IDEXX colleagues for delivering another quarter of strong execution against our organic growth strategy. Our sector remains very dynamic and your steadfast commitment to providing a better future for animals, people and our planet has helped us maintain momentum and deliver strong results.  Not only have you delivered today in the third quarter, but your efforts position us well to continue to develop our sector and support our customers well into the future. Well, on behalf of the management team, thank you for your continued focus on enhancing the health and well-being, the pets, people and livestock. So now we'll conclude the call. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

[Operator Instructions] Today's prepared remarks will be posted to idexx.com investors after the earnings conference call concludes. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and to provide an overview of our financial outlook for 2024. IDEXX had a strong finish to 2023, reflected in our fourth quarter performance. Revenues increased 8% organically, supported by 10% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, net of a 1% growth headwind from fewer equivalent selling days. Operating profits increased 8% as reported and 10% on a comparable basis, benefiting from solid gross margin gains and OpEx leverage. These factors and a lower-than-expected effective tax rate supported delivery of $2.32 per share in EPS in Q4, up 17% on a comparable basis. IDEXX execution enabled delivery of strong full year financial results reflected in 9% overall organic revenue growth and high comparable operating margin gains. This supported a 29% increase in EPS for the full year on a comparable basis, including 12% of combined EPS growth benefit from a customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of discrete 2022 R&D investments. These results were driven by 10.5% full year organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, reflecting 11% organic gains in the US and 10% organic growth in international regions, aligned with our original full year growth targets. We also achieved 19% full year organic growth in recurring software and digital imaging revenues, sustained high customer retention levels and placed a record number of CAG premium instruments, which drove an 11% expansion of our global premium installed base. These strong execution trends position us well as we enter 2024 and advance our growth strategy. This year, we're targeting 10% organic revenue growth at the high end of our initial guidance range of 7% to 10% overall organic revenue growth, supported by 7.5% to 10.5% organic gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. We're also planning for solid comparable operating margin gains, building on our long-term track record supporting continued high comparable EPS growth. We'll walk through the details of our financial guidance later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 8% was driven by 9% organic gains in our CAG business. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue increased 10% organically in Q4, reflecting 9% gains in the US and 12% growth in international regions, net of a 1% global growth headwind from equivalent days effects. CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth was -- in Q4 was supported by average global net price improvement of 6% to 7%, with US net price gains at the low end of this range. IDEXX execution drivers supported volume gains of 4% in both US and international regions normalized for days effects, reflecting an improvement from Q3 volume growth levels and the strongest normalized volume growth quarter in 2023. IDEXX CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth remained solidly above sector growth levels. In the US, CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue increased 9% organically, net of 1% negative growth rate impact from fewer equivalent selling days in Q4. This reflects a 1,050 basis point normalized growth premium compared to US clinical visit growth levels, which declined an estimated 0.5% in the quarter on a same-store basis. IDEXX execution drivers drove solid US value growth in the quarter, reflecting benefits from new business gains, high customer retention levels and sustained diagnostic frequency levels per visit. International CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 12% in Q4, reflecting benefits from higher net price realization and improved volume gains. International results were also supported by strong IDEXX execution, reflected in continued solid growth in premium instrument placements, which supported a 13% year-on-year increase in our international premium instrument install base. IDEXX achieved solid organic gains across our major testing modalities in the fourth quarter. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 13% organically, reflecting double-digit gains across US and international regions. Consumable gains were supported by an 11% increase in our global premium install base in 2023, reflecting strong gains across our Catalyst, Premium Hematology, and SediVue platforms. For the full year 2023, we achieved a record 19,000 premium instrument placements with excellent quality, reflected in sustained, high new and competitive catalyst placements. In Q4, we placed 5,241 premium instruments, up 3% from high prior year levels, driven by strong gains in SediVue placements and continued expansion of ProCyte One. Overall CAG instrument revenues declined 3% organically in the quarter, reflecting comparisons to high prior year levels, program pricing effects, and global mix. Rapid Assay revenue grew 9% organically in Q4, supported by benefits from net price increases and solid volume gains in the US. Global lab revenues expanded 7% organically, reflecting high single-digit gains in the US and sustained solid organic revenue growth in international regions. CAG Veterinary Software and Diagnostic Imaging revenues increased 6% organically in Q4, compared to strong prior-year levels. Results continued to be supported by double-digit growth in recurring revenues and ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. For the full year, Veterinary Software and Diagnostic Imaging revenues increased 11% organically, supported by 19% organic gains in recurring revenues. In our other business segments, water revenues increased 5% organically in Q4 compared to strong prior year levels, supported by continued solid gains in the US and Europe. Overall growth in the quarter was moderated by lower China revenues and year-end order timing. For the full year, Water revenues grew 8% overall and 7% organically. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues decreased 4% organically in Q4 as solid gains in the US, Europe and Latin America were offset by declines in herd health screening revenues and comparisons to higher prior swine testing levels in China. For the full year, LPD revenues were down 1% organically as solid gains across our core ruminant poultry and swine businesses were offset by declines in areas like herd health screening, reflecting regional macro dynamics. We expect to work through comparison issues in herd health screening post the first quarter of 2024. Turning to the P&L. Q4 operating profit increased 8% as reported and 10% on a comparable basis, supported by solid comparable operating margin gains. Gross profit increased 9% as reported and on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 58.4%, up 50 basis points on a comparable basis, adjusting for 70 basis points of negative FX impact, primarily related to the lapping of prior year hedge gains. Gross margin gains reflected benefits from net price improvement, which offset inflationary cost impacts, favorable business mix impacts from strong consumable growth, and higher software service gross margins. Operating expenses were up 9% as reported and 7% on a comparable basis in the quarter, reflecting growth in commercial investments and increases in R&D spending aligned with advancing our innovation initiatives, including our new instrument platforms. For the full year 2023, operating margins were 30%, including approximately 40 basis points of benefit from the Q1 customer contract resolution payment. On a comparable basis, full year operating margins increased 390 basis points, including 280 basis points of combined benefit from the customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of discrete 2022 R&D investments. For the full year, foreign exchange reduced operating margin gains by 60 basis points, primarily related to the lapping of prior year hedge gains. Q4 EPS was $2.32 per share, up 17% on a comparable basis. In Q4, EPS benefited from a lower effective tax rate. This reflected the release of valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions, which lowered our full year effective tax rate by approximately 100 basis points and increased EPS by $0.10 per share. Fourth quarter EPS included $0.02 in tax benefits from share-based compensation activity and $0.04 in headwind from foreign exchange changes primarily related to the lapping of 2022 hedge gains. FX hedge gains were $2 million in the quarter. Full year EPS was $10.06 per share, an increase of 29% on a comparable basis, including 12% of combined EPS growth benefit from the Q1 customer contract resolution payment and the lapping of discrete 2022 R&D investments. For the full year, stock-based compensation activity provided $14 million or $0.16 per share in tax benefit, lowering our effective tax rate by 130 basis points. As noted, full year comparable EPS growth also benefited by $0.10 per share or approximately 1% from the release of tax valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions. Foreign exchange increased Q4 and full year revenue growth by approximately 1% and 0%, respectively. For the full year, foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $25 million and EPS by $0.24 per share, primarily related to the lapping of 2022 hedge gains. In 2023, full year foreign exchange hedge gains were $4 million. Free cash flow was $773 million for 2023 or 91% of net income. Free cash flow conversion was above the high end of earlier projections, reflecting timing and control of capital spending. Capital spending was $134 million for the full year or 3.7% of revenue. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended 2023 with leverage ratios of 0.7 times gross and 0.4 times net of cash. Our 2024 interest expense outlook incorporates recent forward interest rates and expectations for similar leverage ratios this year. We allocated $38 million to repurchase 90,000 shares in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2023, we allocated $83 million to repurchase 175,000 shares. Targeted deployment of cash to share repurchases supports our projected 0.5% to 1% reduction in diluted shares outstanding for the full year 2024. Turning to our 2024 full year outlook. We're providing initial guidance for revenues of $3,930 million to $4,040 million, an increase of 7.5% to 10.5% on a reported basis. On an organic basis, this reflects a growth range of 7% to 10% overall, supported by 7.5% to 10.5% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Current exchange rates, we expect foreign exchange to have limited impact on full year revenue growth. Our reported revenue growth outlook includes approximately $15 million of projected revenue from our recent software acquisition, which Jay will highlight in his comments. In terms of the key drivers of our 2024 organic growth outlook. The midpoint of our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth range incorporates expectations for global net price gains of approximately 5% and volume gains of approximately 4%, aligned with assumptions for relatively flat US clinical visit same-store growth levels post Q1. As we'll discuss, we have seen some effects from severe US weather trends in January, which we expect will impact overall Q1 clinical visit growth levels. Our full year outlook reflects a US volume growth premium to US clinical visits aligned with our trends in the second half of 2023, supported by expectations for continued solid global growth benefits from IDEXX execution drivers. The higher end of our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook range captures the potential for improved sector visit and same-store growth trends and overall IDEXX volume growth potential. The lower end of the range calibrates for potential risk to our targeted growth goals, including effects from macroeconomic conditions. The high end of our overall organic revenue growth guidance of 10% is aligned with our long-term goals. We expect overall organic growth to be constrained somewhat by expectations for modest organic growth in LPD and comparisons to strong prior year instrument placement levels. Our reported operating margin guidance for the full year of 2024 is 30.2% to 30.7%. On a comparable basis, this reflects an outlook for 20 to 70 basis points of improvement in comparable annual operating margins, net of a negative 40 basis point operating margin impact related to the lapping of the Q1 2023 customer contract resolution payment. We're planning for solid gross margin gains on a comparable basis in 2023, supported by continued strong growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues, expansion of our cloud-based software business, and benefits from lab productivity initiatives. We expect limited impact from foreign exchange on 2024 revenue growth and operating margin at the rates assumed in our press release. We estimate foreign exchange will increase full year EPS by $0.02 per share given current hedge positions. In terms of sensitivities to changes to the foreign exchange rates assumed in our press release, we projected that a 1% change in the value of the US dollar would impact full year reported revenue by approximately $30 million and operating income by approximately $4 million net of hedges. Our 2024 EPS outlook is $10.84 to $11.33 per share. This reflects an increase of 8% to 13% as reported and, on a comparable basis, net of a 2% EPS growth headwind from the lapping of the customer contract resolution payment and 1% of headwind related to lapping and benefits from tax valuation reserve releases in 2023. Our EPS outlook factors in a 1.5% increase in our overall effective tax rate to approximately 22% in 2024, reflecting these lapping impacts and lower projected benefits from share-based compensation activity. Our EPS outlook captures expected benefits in 2024 from lower interest expense compared to 2023, as well as expectations for reductions in average share count. Our 2024 free cash flow outlook is for a net income to free cash flow conversion ratio of 90% to 95%, aligned with our long-term goals. This reflects estimated capital spending of $180 million or approximately 4.5% of revenues. Overall, we're well positioned to deliver continued strong financial performance in 2024. In terms of our operational outlook for Q1, we're planning for overall organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, factoring in approximately 1% of negative growth impact from severe weather in the US in January, and constraints on Q1 growth in areas like LPD related to tougher year-on-year comparisons. Reported revenue growth should be largely in line with organic revenue growth estimates. In terms of our profit outlook, we're planning for reported operating margins of 29.4% to 29.8% in Q1. This reflects an outlook for flat to moderate expansion in comparable operating margins, adjusting for the lapping of the prior year $16 million customer contract resolution payment recorded in Q1 2023 as an offset to operating expense. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Jay Mazelsky : Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter, capping a year where we advanced our strategic priorities while driving strong business growth and excellent financial results. Our high touch commercial model, the focus on the customer, and accelerated innovation drivers supported ongoing sector development. The use of growth in relevant diagnostic testing generates important clinical insights that informed veterinarians' mission to deliver better medical care while growing their businesses in a highly profitable diagnostics category. High levels of execution against our strategy drove double-digit CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2023. This was aligned with our original full year growth targets and reflected strong gains across our major regions. High growth in our durable high-return annuity revenues included strong growth in our recurring software and digital imaging annuity streams. These gains reflected the cumulative impact of double-digit growth in our global premium instrument installed base, supported by high-quality instrument placements, solid new business gains, expansion of integrated cloud-based software solutions, and net price realization aligned with the value we deliver. IDEXX commercial teams delivered improved volume gains this quarter as we continued to work through factors constraining clinical visit levels. The solid growth momentum we carried through 2023 demonstrates that customers of all types appreciate IDEXX's purpose-built solutions and seek these tools and services to achieve sought-after efficiency gains. We're excited to build on this momentum in 2024. Today, I'll highlight the key capabilities and initiatives that have advanced our strategy to address the long-term growth opportunity for our business, through direct commercial partnership and innovation to enhance care delivery. I'll start with a review of our global commercial execution and its foundational role in creating awareness, education and, ultimately, the increased use of IDEXX Diagnostics. IDEXX's commercial teams bring deep subject matter expertise and a partnership mindset that has resulted in gains above sector growth levels. Solid premium instrument placement growth in Q4 capped off a year of record premium instrument placements. Outstanding full year performance was reflected in sustained high levels of Catalyst placements at new and competitive accounts, including record new and competitive placement levels in the U.S. We also realized double-digit expansion of our Premium Hematology and SediVue installed bases. High-quality, high EVI placements, coupled with sustained customer retention rates in the 97% to 99% range for the US and, similarly, high levels globally set a solid foundation for future CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth. It also demonstrates our customers' appreciation for IDEXX is easy to use in clinic platforms that provide them with deep diagnostic insights necessary to delivering high levels of pet health care, while managing workflow effectively in a busy and dynamic clinic backdrop. Our effectiveness in growing the installed base for premium instruments not only benefits our consumables' recurring revenue stream, but also drives growth across our diagnostic modalities as testing begets testing, and our customers are inspired to expand their use of IDEXX solutions. This adoption of our multi-modality offering is supported by strong customer interest and marketing programs like IDEXX 360, which makes the adoption of IDEXX technology easy and financially appealing. The adoption of these technologies help support sector diagnostics revenue growth in the US in the fourth quarter, which benefited from diagnostic frequency expansion and wellness visits and diagnostics utilization gains overall. Diagnostics remains one of the fastest-growing areas in the veterinary practice, reflected in solid and sustained high single-digit same-store revenue growth at the practice level. Our long-term investments in commercial and R&D resources positions IDEXX well to help our customers build on this momentum. Our growing global direct commercial capability is an important element of this strategy to sustain strong CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth. Our most recent commercial expansion was completed in the US during Q4, and is the first in four years as many of our territories have become very large. It complements the seven targeted international expansions we've advanced since 2021 in countries around the world. These are attractive, high-return investments that support future growth by delivering high-touch commercial engagement in our fastest-growing regions, and our commercial teams have consistently shown the ability to complete these expansions while still delivering strong business results. Our international business performance is showing the benefits of our expanded global commercial capability. We continue to achieve strong new business gains, reflected in the 13% expansion of our international premium installed base this year, driven by double-digit installed base growth across our chemistry, hematology and urine sediment in clinic platforms. These gains drove improved international CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth, specifically for sequential quarters of volume growth normalized for days despite macro headwinds that have pressured same-store sales levels. The expanded footprint of our VDC based commercial model in international regions, customer-friendly marketing programs like IDEXX 360, and an expanded international lab network gives us the right tools to successfully address the approximately 2/3 of the total opportunity estimate which exists outside the US In addition to growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, IDEXX also delivered very strong performance this year in expanding our veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging segment. Our software and imaging solutions provide busy customers with an intuitive and efficient way to access diagnostic insights and manage important workflow and communications across our clinics. Clinics continue to embrace the opportunity to embed software in many aspects of their business and use technology to generate diagnostic insights, eliminate pain points across back-end areas of the clinic, and open meaningful lines of communication with their increasingly younger customer demographic. By adopting these contemporary software solutions, clinicians and their staff are significantly better able to focus on providing high levels of care for their patients and reduce their time spent on unrewarded administrative activities that either help them practice medicine or help them drive business growth. Supported by excellent commercial engagement and performance, fourth quarter PIMS placements continued to be driven by interest in cloud native products, which represented over 90% of placements in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2023, supporting strong double-digit cloud PIMS installed base growth for the year. This high adoption of IDEXX software solutions drove 19% of organic gains in our highly profitable recurring revenues in the veterinary software diagnostic imaging segment this year. These gains provide a growing attractive profit stream to the company and delivers a multiplier benefit as loyal software customers grow their diagnostic revenues faster. Our veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging recurring revenues benefit from growth in our PIMS installed base and from our focus on expanding IDEXX's subscription-based service portfolio. IDEXX Web PACS, our cloud native workflow engine for digital imaging, is a great example. We're pleased with the continued double-digit Web PACS subscriber growth which thousands of practices have adopted and fully integrated into the IDEXX software technology stack. We recently added advanced dental imaging workflows to Web PACS, addressing a major pain point for the 75% of practices who regularly take dental x-rays. These integrated dental imaging workflows, including full dental charts and two specific image sorting, streamlines what is otherwise a complicated and time-intensive process for practices. These results demonstrate the benefits from our innovative integrated software offering that is globally relevant to a wide variety of clinics. We're building on our momentum with existing platforms such as VetConnect PLUS and with new solutions to further drive efficiencies within the clinic. One example of which is an updated user experience for the IDEXX VetLab Station, which is a practice team's one-stop control panel and workflow engine. Announced recently at VMX and coming to our customers in the second half of 2024, this new interface will deliver two times two times faster in-clinic diagnostic workflows for all instruments across the IDEXX VetLab suite. Additionally, while both our diagnostics and software businesses rely primarily on organic growth, we continue to look for attractive and strategic acquisitions to deliver more value to our customers and their clients. We recently closed the acquisition of a private US based software and data platform that enhances our software ecosystem and further accelerates our growth in that business. This acquisition extends our PIMS cloud-native workflow and deliver strategic data solutions to our customers and their clients. As we integrate its capabilities deeply inside PIMS platforms, we believe there will be sector growth benefits for deeper engagement between manufacturers, customers and pet owners to drive adoption of highly relevant clinical offerings. Innovation is a bedrock of how IDEXX has been able to provide our customers with critical diagnostic insights that enable and drive the medical care envelope. We've invested over $2 billion over the last 20-plus years in instrument platform development, differentiated assay discovery and customer-facing software, data and connectivity. Our commitment and leadership and innovation has driven sector development through higher standards of care in global animal health. The most recent example of our commitment to transformational innovation is within our point-of-care business. The IDEXX inVue Dx cellular analyzer is an advanced optics and AI platform, cellular imaging that removes the need for clinic staff to prepare and interpret sizes, delivering clinically insightful diagnostic test results while giving valuable time back to the practice. It works by interrogating and interpreting cells in intracellular structures in their natural state, providing spectacular 3D images that enables differential diagnosis to slide-based methods. The near-term menu for this new platform will address highly relevant, high-volume established categories, including ear cytology and blood morphology, both available when we begin shipping the product in Q4 of this year with fine needle-aspir testing on lumps and bumps to be available next. With built-in advanced optics, powerful AI leveraging our global pathology expertise, and two-way connectivity, the IDEXX inVue Dx Analyzer allows for continued menu expansion, building off our proven track record of increasing value over time of IDEXX products and service offerings. We estimate a 20,000 global placement opportunity over five years from the point of shipment in Q4 of this year, driven by a highly relevant menu and intuitive time-saving workflow. Customer response to initial trials into our announcement at VMX were overwhelmingly positive. In addition to the IDEXX inVue Dx Analyzer, we also recently announced the latest addition to our Fecal Dx antigen platform at our reference labs. Already the gold standard for Fecal diagnostics, the Fecal Dx antigen platform now identifies Cystoisospora, a common intestinal parasite that typically impacts young dogs and cats, representing the second extension in as many years. Available at no additional costs starting next month, the addition of Cystoisospora will make the best even better and help clinicians have even greater confidence when they choose IDEXX's reference labs for one of the most common time-consuming preventive screening tests. In addition to this expansion on our Fecal Dx antigen panel as planned, we have successfully launched of IDEXX Cystatin B in North America in December, adding kidney injury detection to what is already the most comprehensive menu for kidney health in the industry. Since launch, about 10,000 IDEXX customers have benefited from over 200,000 IDEXX Cystatin B test in North America. Overall, we're very proud of the accomplishments we've been able to advance this year in expanding our business capabilities and value-added partnerships with our customers. Our focus on attractive investment and innovation opportunities, while delivering strong financial results, helped drive exceptional return on invested capital in 2023. With that, I'll conclude by thanking our nearly 11,000 IDEXX colleagues for their ongoing commitment to our purpose and their strong execution against our strategy. These business results require coordinated, intensive work across the organization and IDEXX teams rose to the challenge. High levels of performance across the company, both delivered today in 2023 and set us up well to build off this growth through 2024. There's a significant attractive opportunity to continue to inspire the adoption and utilization of diagnostic solutions and related products. Our IDEXX teams continue to work tirelessly to address this opportunity, while pursuing our mission to provide a better future for animals, people and our planet. It's an honor to report IDEXX's progress and results on behalf of our colleagues. So on behalf of the IDEXX management team, thank you for all your efforts this year. With that, we'll now conclude our prepared remarks and open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the question, all the color and the remarks here. I guess my question here is just, it seems like you have a bit wider range on the 2024 revenue guidance than in the past. So I just would like a little bit more color in terms of what's driving that range and where you're seeing the most uncertainty in the year. And maybe just part of that, just latest thinking on the macro environment and how you're kind of reflecting kind of the broader macro environment and the guidance for this year. Thanks so much. Brian McKeon : Thanks, Chris. Yes, the guidance range represents about a 3% range. I think we highlighted in our comment some of the logic around the midpoint outlook, which largely captures, I think, the underlying sector trends that we've seen recently in the business, as well as the benefits that we're getting from our execution. The higher end of the range really builds in the potential for sector improvement. I think that we see clinical visit growth levels, same-store sales levels internationally have been below what we think will be the longer-term trends in our sector. And so that captures a potential for upside on that front as well as even stronger execution from our teams. And I think the downside from that midpoint view is capturing risks, including macro risks. And so it's not all that different than I think where we started last year, and we ended up delivering at the higher end of our range, supported by strong execution. So we'll always strive to do that, but that will involve some improvement in the sector trends in terms of the assumptions that we laid out. Operator : Our next question today comes from Nathan Rich of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Nathan Rich : Great. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Maybe just kind of following up on that. I wanted to make sure I kind of understood the kind of underlying end-market assumptions that's embedded in guidance. I guess, could you maybe kind of talk us through how you see the year playing out? I know you said 100 basis point impact from weather. But I'd be kind of interested if you can maybe just detail your kind of clinical visit expectations for the first quarter. And then you said kind of flat same-store visits kind of post Q1. Would you expect to be around that level in Q2 and then over the balance of the year? And the other thing that I think stood out from your prepared remarks was just the strongest kind of normalized volume growth in the fourth quarter of 2023. Just any color you could share on kind of what drove that, and maybe what you're kind of expecting over the balance of '24? Thank you. Brian McKeon : Thanks, Nate. Yes, maybe I can start with your last question just to set context. But we had a very good finish to the year in terms of our performance. As you mentioned, the volume trends when you normalize for days effects, we had 4% volume growth US and internationally that was improved from a softer Q3 and actually was our strongest volume growth quarter for the year. So we feel very good about that, and reflects the ongoing benefits that we're getting from the strong execution by our teams. As we thought about our outlook for, and our plans, for 2024, we're looking to build on that. We highlighted that that's -- our volume growth expectation for the year at midpoint is roughly in line with the strong trends we have coming out of the second half, we'll get additional benefit from the pricing that we noted. I think before the weather impacts that we highlighted, we were -- our midpoint view was for largely flat clinical visits in 2024 in the US and somewhat similar trends in international, which had improved in the second half last year, but were still somewhat of a headwind. We explicitly factored in. We're about $10 million of impact, we think, in the US from the severe weather in January. So we're just trying to capture that in Q1 and flowing that through as well for the full year. But we think that's isolated to January. We're hopeful we'll see kind of or at least assuming we've got a flattening in trends and hopefully we'll see some improvement over time aligned with the long-term growth potential we see. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. And then -- and just to add some color to Brian's remarks. Yes, the end-market appears to be stabilized and healthy. There's good underlying client and pet owner demand, if you take a look at both practice revenue and clinic revenue, it was about 5% in the fourth quarter. From a positioning standpoint, I think customers appreciate the technology solutions that we bring across in all the diagnostic testing modalities. Even more so with software, I think there's a new hunger for really looking at tools that can help them run their practices better, whether it's workflow productivity play, communications, client and internal communications, but also as part of the delivery of care and the way it all integrates. So I think the assumption is that customers will continue to work through some of the capacity challenges that they've had and looking for tools and partnerships to be able to do that. And we're especially, I think, well positioned to help them. Nathan Rich : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question today comes from Michael Ryskin of Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : Hey, thanks for taking the question, guys, and congrats on the quarter, strong end to the year. I wanted to expand a little bit on the inVue. You guys did a great launch of VMX that was really informative. Just curious, you talked about late 2024 launch or 4Q launch. Are you embedding any contribution in numbers this year, obviously, since it's only going to be couple of months, it's not going to be meaningful? But I'm just wondering, of that revenue target how much are you attributing to inVue already? And then the other question, I'll just throw both at once. You talked about 5% net price this year. That compares to, I believe you ended last year at 7% to 8%. So you're kind of sort of moderate back down to historical levels. Just wondering what's sort of been the feedback to price recently as you've announced the 2024 price rollout? And if you could provide any difference on US versus OUS price, that would be helpful. Thanks. Brian McKeon : Mike, why don't I just briefly address the guidance question then let Jay talk more about the inVue launch? But the -- we've included the assumption for the launch in our overall guidance. It will be principally instrument revenue benefits in the fourth quarter, as we build the annuity revenues over time from that instrument, that it's all captured in our outlook. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. Just some follow-up commentary on the inVue launch. Customers, I think, very excited to learn more about that, as well as our commercial organization. Talking to the customers who are looking for help with those very high-volume relevant tests that they do today, I think, with the ear cytology and blood morphology, it certainly fits into that profile. It helps address what I think is a gap from a care standpoint. Especially on the blood morphology standpoint where they'd like to do more blood morphologies, but due to the complexities and variability and time constraints with slides, they don't always do as many as they would like. to do. So we're very excited by that. And I think it fits the marketplace and it fits that need. And importantly, it doesn't add work. It's not moving work around. It eliminates work that would otherwise practices are left with. So I think it hits on both the cylinders of delivering excellent medical care but also workflow productivity improvements. Operator : We will now take a question from -- Jay Mazelsky : Sorry, Michael, you had also asked about the pricing piece. Keep in mind that pricing is -- there's a mix of combination by different customer types. And so there's not a single way to talk about it. We obviously have corporate customers who may be under longer-term contracts, as well as different program effects. So we think that the 5% debt that we provided as a guide both reflects -- is commensurate with the value that we're delivering and very much in line with what customers see from an IDEXX contribution standpoint. Keep in mind, we don't set the pet owner price. That's up to the veterinarian to decide how they decide to price that and mark it up. And typically, there's an uplift that they factor into their practice management systems. And they obviously price through differentiation -- and not just differentiation in terms of the test itself, but also the medical services piece of it. Michael Ryskin : Thanks so much for coming back to me. Appreciate that, Jay. Operator : Our next question comes from [indiscernible] of BNP Paribas. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on inVue, if you could provide maybe the early KOL feedback regarding the slide-free and load-and-go technology or any other area of feedback and whether you're able to provide more information for modeling purposes, including the timing of additional indication. And I just have also a second question, whether we could expect further innovation to be announced on assays in 2024? And would you consider for further M&A in software? Thank you. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. So let me talk a little bit about inVue and some of the key opinion leader feedback. We've had a number of key opinion leaders involved as part of the upfront definition and development of inVue. So there's -- we typically do involve them when we're bringing something new to the market, new to the world like this. I think the exciting thing from their perspective is that you're looking at cellular structures, including intracellular structures within their natural state. When you prepare a slide, it's a 2D, I don't want to use the word squish, but I'll use the word you're sort of squishing it. So you're getting a non-natural look at it. When you have a three-dimensional view and can interrogate it in that natural state, you see things that you don't otherwise -- you wouldn't otherwise see and are able to provide differential diagnosis from that. So they're very excited by that. I think veterinarians, in general, are very excited by the fact that you don't have to prepare a slide. They know they spend 10 to 20 minutes on that. It's technique-sensitive, it's highly variable. Therefore, the output in interpretation is variable. So having a solution like that, that's relevant, that's something that they -- is well understood, I think they're very enthusiastic about that. With respect to innovation this year and announcing innovation, not going to talk about that. At this point, we're constantly innovating our product development pipeline, and funnel is filled with very interesting activities. And as we get closer to launch of particular assay or software or instrument, then we talk about it and then we'll disclose more. Operator : Our next question today comes from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley. Erin Wright : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I just had another follow-up on inVue and then I have another follow-up after that. But on inVue, could the launch be expedited at all? Or could you do like an earlier soft launch with that with that instrument? And do you still have that other diagnostic platform in the pipeline? Is that more of a 2025 event or later? Jay Mazelsky : Yes. So with respect to the point-of-care platform launches. We have a very well-defined tried and true method of developing platforms, putting it in the hands of customers, getting feedback in terms of how it works within a real operating environment. We know that there's a difference between bench-top development and what you see within the clinic when we launch something and begin shipping it. We want to make sure that the average time between support events are four, five, six years. These are world-class levels of performance. And our customers expect that of us. We don't want to premature launch and maybe have issues that are disruptive to the practice environment. So we're comfortable with what we've guided to in terms of the timing of that and making sure that it fits within software ecosystem and the overall operating environment of the practice itself. We're not further disclosing our next point-of-care platform other than what we've talked in the past, we have one, it's outside of the existing testing categories, and when we get closer to launch, we'll talk about it. Erin Wright : Okay. Thanks. And then a bigger picture question. Just has there been any sort of changes or evolving opportunities as it relates to the competitive landscape, I guess, particularly in the US? Could disruptions in sort of new ownership of one of your competitors or changes in distribution for the other -- one of your competitors is that presenting opportunities for you to take share at this point that you may not have seen previously in either across individual accounts or corporate accounts too? Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. Our markets have been very competitive for a long time. I think new ownership hasn't really changed that dynamic. Some of our competitors were also partners with on the clinical services and equipment side. Customers have a choice. Our focus is on continuing to innovate to help address the challenging problems they have in the practice, whether it's capacity constraints, whether it's introducing new testing solutions, to give them better medical results. What we find at the end of the day is customers appreciate the integrated nature of our offering, the ability to generate seamless user-friendly, customer-friendly way these critical insights that inform great medical decisions that help produce outcomes and do it productively. That's where our focus is and that's where our focus is going to remain. Operator : We will now take a question from Jon Block of Stifel Financial. Jonathan Block : Thanks, guys. Good morning. Brian, maybe just from a modeling perspective. Anyway to think about the gross margin versus op margin expansion this year? Do we get GM expansion because another decent year with price? And then if you look at OpEx, R&D was up for the fourth quarter in a row, actually, the R&D was up 20% year-over-year, G&A down two quarters in a row. So just anything on the GM or OpEx to detail as we sort of sharpen our pencils on '24? Brian McKeon : Sure. Thanks for the question, Jon. Just to revisit what we shared was we're targeting 20 to 70 basis points of comparable improvement net of the 40 bps from -- headwind from the customer contract resolution payment. So normalized for that, that's 60 to 110 basis points. We think that will primarily be driven by gross margin gains, consistent with the progress that we supported our 110 basis point improvement in 2023. We benefit as we help our customers grow faster and CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues grow. That includes price benefits that help us to offset inflationary impacts. We're also continuing to benefit as we grow our cloud-based software business. It's an excellent business for us, and we're doing a great job expanding that business and improving our profitability in the software front. And also have an ongoing focus on improving our lab operations, including benefits from expanding our business. So we think we have a number of drivers that will help us to build on our gross profit gains. In terms of our investment profile, I think you highlight where our priorities are. We want to support our innovation agenda. That's an area that's been very high return for us over time. We obviously have the platform that we're launching this year and ongoing innovation that we're supporting. We're continuing to invest in our commercial operations. We had a US expansion recently that we invested in. And we'll continue to look at opportunities to enhance our commercial capability globally and be efficient overall and try to manage our OpEx largely in line with revenue growth. I think that's a reasonable assumption. I think if we do a better job of growing, grow faster, that always there's an opportunity to get some leverage on that front. But I think our plans are to sustain the OpEx investment in line with revenue and prioritize the innovation and commercial agenda. Jonathan Block : Okay. Great. That was very helpful. Thank you for that. And then just sort of a long second question, more clarification. So it seems like the 2024 vet visit growth expectation is zero, if I had that right, at the midpoint of your 7.5% to 10.5% CAG Dx recurring. I just want to make sure I got that right. And then what's the expectation for 1Q'24 visits. Was that the negative 1% for full quarter? I'm just trying to sort of get at the implied 2Q to 4Q vet visit assumption? And then just sort of a quick miscellaneous tack-on, anything for price to call out US versus international when we think about the 5% global? And then what about days? Do you get an extra day this year? And does that have any tailwind to the growth rates? Thanks, guys/ Brian McKeon : Okay. So just on the first one, maybe a simple way to understand this is post Q1, we're, I think I said this in my comments, the midpoint assumes largely flat clinical business in the US. So we're trying to capture that there's about $10 million of headwind that we saw from January. Whether that's principally going to impact the US business, it is US risk, and that will -- we think we'll be seeing in the clinical visit numbers. So we're not trying to estimate that for Q1, but that's obviously a headwind that we're trying to factor in. But I think the bigger picture, Jon, is midpoint, is the midpoint assumptions are largely flat, US clinical visits in Q2 to Q4 timeframe. I think you had a question on price US versus international. We're not guiding regionally, but the 5%, we're expecting solid net price realization globally consistent with what we're able to execute this year. And so I think we're, again, without being specific, you should expect solid price realization in US and international regions. And days, we don't have a material kind of full year dynamic. We'll share clarity as we go through quarter-by-quarter on that, but we're not highlighting that as an issue in Q1 and it's -- or for the full year. Jonathan Block : All right. Thanks, guys. Jay Mazelsky : Okay. Thank you. So we don't have further questions. So with that, thank you for your questions. We'll now conclude our Q&A portion of this morning's call. It's been a pleasure to review another quarter of strong IDEXX results. In summary, IDEXX is well positioned to sustain the momentum we've built into 2024, which will continue to help us address the significant decades-long opportunity to raise the standard of care for companion animal health care. Our consistent strategy focused on supporting increased utilization of diagnostics is a key factor in elevating the standards of care and has helped us navigate the highly dynamic external environment in our sector. We look forward to continued strong execution against our strategic priorities by teams across IDEXX as we move forward through 2024 and beyond. So thank you for your participation this morning, and we'll now conclude the call. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Participating in the call this morning are Jay Mazelsky, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brian McKeon, Chief Financial Officer; and John Ravis, Vice President, Investor Relations. IDEXX would like to preface the discussion today with a caution regarding forward-looking statements. Listeners are reminded that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Additional information regarding these risks and uncertainties is available under the forward-looking statements noticed in our press release issued this morning, as well as in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which can be obtained from the SEC or by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website, idexx.com. During this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. In reviewing our first quarter 2024 results and updated 2024 guidance, please note all references to growth, organic growth and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent prior year period unless otherwise noted. To allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit their questions to one with one follow-up as necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions, please feel free to get back into the queue, and if time permits, we'll take your additional questions. Today's prepared remarks will be posted to idexx.com Investors after the earnings conference call concludes. I would like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Today, I'll take you through our Q1 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2024. In terms of highlights, IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue growth and strong profit gains in the first quarter. Overall revenues increased 7% organically, supported by 7% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. Solid revenue gains were net of negative growth effects from severe U.S. weather in January which we estimated lowered overall IDEXX organic revenue growth by 0.5% to 1% and added pressure to U.S. same-store clinical visit growth levels. IDEXX execution trends remained strong, reflected in a continued high IDEXX CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth premium, 8% global gains in premium instrument placements and 11% organic gains in recurring veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues. Profit delivery was excellent in the quarter, supported by gross margin gains. Strong operating margin performance enabled EPS delivery of $2.81 per share. EPS was up 10% as reported and 9% on a comparable basis, net of a 7% negative EPS growth impact for the lapping of a prior year customer contract resolution payment. Overall, we're pleased with our continued progress in expanding our business and delivering strong financial performance as we continue to work through sector and macro factors that have constrained visit growth at veterinary clinics. We've updated our 2024 financial outlook to incorporate recent sector trends which we estimate will constrain the high end of our full year organic growth outlook this year. We've also incorporated updated estimates for foreign exchange effects to reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Building on our strong first quarter performance, we're reinforcing our operational EPS outlook at midpoint. This reflects consistent goals for solid comparable operating margin improvement this year and favorable adjustments to estimates for net interest expense benefiting from our strong cash flow generation. We'll review our updated guidance detail later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our first quarter results. First quarter organic revenue growth of 7% was driven by 7% organic CAG gains and 11% organic growth in our Water business, with overall gains moderated by a 3% organic growth decline in LPD. CAG organic revenue growth was supported by 8% organic growth in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues driven by 11% organic gains in recurring revenues. CAG instrument revenue increased 3% organically, building on high prior year placement levels. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue increased 7% organically in Q1, supported by average global net price improvement of 5% to 6%, with U.S. net price realization at the lower end of this range. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q1 reflected solid gains across our major regions. International CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue organic growth was 9% reflecting benefits from net price realization and solid volume gains, building on 2023 second half momentum. International results continue to be driven by IDEXX execution reflected in strong business gains and high premium instrument placements, which supported a double-digit year-on-year expansion of our global premium instrument installed base. U.S. CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue organic growth was 6.5% in Q1, which reflects a continued significant growth premium compared to same-store U.S. clinical visit growth levels, which declined an estimated 2.3% overall in the quarter, including negative impacts from severe January weather. IDEXX's solid growth results reflect sustained levels of diagnostic frequency and increased diagnostic utilization per clinical visit at the practice level. It also reflects benefits from IDEXX execution drivers, including solid new business gains, sustained high customer retention levels and net price realization. Excluding estimated weather impacts, U.S. clinical visit growth levels in the first quarter were relatively softer than targeted in our midpoint outlook. These trends reflect ongoing staffing challenges at veterinary clinics and potentially pressure on U.S. consumers from broader cumulative macro impacts. While pet owner demand for health care services remains durable and resilient, and we're confident in IDEXX's ability to execute and drive continued solid organic revenue growth, we believe it's prudent to factor these near-term sector trends into our outlook. This is reflected in adjustments to the high end of our 2024 full year organic revenue growth guidance. IDEXX achieved solid organic revenue growth across our modalities in Q1. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 9% organically, reflecting high single-digit gains in the U.S. and double-digit organic growth in international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 11% year-on-year growth in our global premium instrument installed base, reflecting gains across our Catalyst, Premium Hematology and SediVue platforms. We placed 4,791 CAG premium instrument placements in Q1, an increase of 8% year-on-year compared to high prior year levels. This was supported by strong growth in ProCyte One placements with the global ProCyte One installed base increasing to over 15,000 instruments. Global Catalyst placements decreased year-on-year in the quarter, reflecting comparisons to high prior year placement levels and shifts in placement mix in the international regions. Global Rapid Assay revenues expanded 5% organically in Q1 driven by high single-digit gains in the U.S., including benefits from higher net price realization. Global Lab revenues increased 6% organically, reflecting similar solid gains in the U.S. and international regions. Veterinary Software and Diagnostic Imaging revenues increased 12% as reported, including benefits from our recent software and data platform acquisition, which adds to our software ecosystem. 8% overall organic gains were driven by 11% organic growth in recurring revenues, reflecting benefits from ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. Water revenues increased 11% organically in Q1, driven by double-digit gains in the U.S. and Europe, including benefits from higher shipment order timing. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues decreased 3% organically. Solid gains in the U.S. and Europe were moderated by lower Asia Pacific revenues, including impacts from lower herd health screening revenues related to reduced China import testing in comparison to higher prior year swine testing levels in China. We expect these negative growth impacts to moderate in the second half of 2024. Turning to the P&L. Q1 profit results were supported by solid gross margin gains. Gross profit increased 9% in the quarter as reported and on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 61.5%, up 110 basis points on a comparable basis. Gross margin gains reflected benefits from business mix, lower instrument costs and software service margin expansion. On a reported basis, operating expenses increased 12% year-on-year including approximately 6.5% of overall growth impact related to the lapping of a prior $16 million customer contract resolution payment. Q1 OpEx growth was driven by increases in R&D spending aligned with advancing our innovation agenda, including new platform development. EPS was $2.81 per share in Q1, an increase of 10% as reported and 9% on a comparable basis, net of a 7% negative EPS growth rate impact related to the lapping of the prior year customer contract resolution payment. Foreign exchange had a limited impact on gross margin, operating profits and EPS in the quarter, net of a $1 million hedge gain. Free cash flow was $168 million in Q1, reflecting normal seasonality. On a trailing 12-month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion ratio was 92%. For the full year, we're maintaining our outlook for free cash flow conversion of 90% to 95%, reflecting estimated capital spending of approximately $180 million. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 0.7x gross and 0.4x net of cash as we continue to manage our balance sheet conservatively in the current interest rate environment. We allocated $155 million in capital to share repurchases in the first quarter. Diluted shares outstanding were relatively flat compared to prior year levels. Turning to 2024 guidance. We've updated our full year P&L outlook to reflect adjustments to the high end of our full year organic growth goals. Our outlook reinforces our full year goals for solid comparable operating margin improvement and incorporates favorable adjustments to estimates for net interest expense. We've also revised estimates for foreign exchange impacts, reflecting the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. In terms of our revenue outlook, we've updated our full year guidance for reported revenues to $3.895 billion to $3.965 billion, a reduction of $55 million at midpoint. Compared to earlier estimates, our updated reported revenue outlook includes a $35 million or approximately 1% negative growth rate impact related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We've also lowered the high end of our full year organic growth outlook by 1% to capture more recent trends for U.S. clinical visits, which have constrained the organic revenue growth outlook for the first half of 2024. Our updated full year guidance for overall organic growth is now 7% to 9%, supported by 7.5% to 9.5% gains in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. For the full year, our outlook for overall organic growth continues to reflect expectations for solid CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue gains, supported by IDEXX execution. Our midpoint outlook aligns with expectations of approximately 1.5% declines in U.S. clinic visits in Q2, similar to late Q1 trends. The second half of 2024, our midpoint outlook continues to assume a relative flattening of U.S. clinical visit trends. We expect our H2 organic revenue growth results to benefit by approximately 0.5% overall from equivalent days effects, reflecting approximately 1% organic growth rate benefits in Q3 with limited overall effects to full year growth. Our full year CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue outlook reflects consistent expectations for global net price improvement of approximately 5%. In terms of our profit guidance, we're maintaining our outlook for reported operating margins of 30.2% to 30.7% for the full year 2024, supported by continued high levels of operating execution. This outlook aligns with 20 to 70 basis points in full year comparable operating margin expansion, net of a negative 40 basis point impact related to the lapping of the Q1 2023 customer contract resolution payment. Our updated full year EPS outlook of $10.82 to $11.20 per share is down $0.08 per share at midpoint, driven by our updated foreign exchange estimates. We now estimate foreign exchange will have a negative $0.09 per share full year EPS impact, $0.11 per share unfavorable to prior estimates. Operationally, reductions to the high end of our organic revenue growth guidance are mitigated by our sustained operating margin improvement outlook by approximately $0.06 per share of net favorability from updated net interest expense projections. In terms of our outlook for Q2, we're planning for reported revenue growth of 5% to 7.5%, net of an estimated 1.5% growth headwind from FX. This outlook aligns with an organic revenue growth range of 6% to 8.5% and incorporates growth benefits from our recent software acquisition. As noted, at midpoint, the Q2 organic revenue growth outlook aligns with the relatively softer U.S. clinical visit growth trends seen at the end of the first quarter. We're planning for reported operating margins of 31.0% to 31.4% in Q2, flat to down moderately on a comparable basis, factoring in projections for relatively higher quarterly R&D spending in support of new platform advancement. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Jay Mazelsky : Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX had a solid start to the year as we continue to advance our strategy to drive the development of the Companion Animal diagnostics sector through innovation and customer engagement. Our ongoing progress benefits from the durable secular growth drivers that have supported the multi-decade expansion of Companion Animal Medical Services. These drivers include growth in the pet population in the strengthened human pet bond as well as the ongoing expansion of pet healthcare services. Medical services is in turn enabled by diagnostics and is a key element of vet clinic growth and profitability. IDEXX's business strategy is focused on enabling long-term sector growth by providing unparalleled diagnostic insight through our leading testing and software solutions. This is supported by a robust innovation agenda and a high-touch customer-centered commercial model that helps clinicians test with confidence in an intuitive and efficient way, supporting their mission of delivering high levels of care. Our strategy is brought to life by teams across IDEXX, who collectively executed at a high level in the quarter, reflected in continued global expansion of our Diagnostics and Software Solutions and solid growth in recurring revenues. CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues once again grew at a healthy premium to the sector, supported by solid contribution from new business gains, sustained high customer retention rates and net price realization that reflects the increased value that our products and services deliver to our customers. IDEXX commercial teams delivered strong growth in global premium instrument placements, reflecting high interest in adopting IDEXX's point-of-care innovations including expansion of our newest platform solution, ProCyte One. Cloud-based software placements once again expanded in the quarter, reflecting vet clinic interest in cloud-native solutions and the IDEXX full stack software suite that continues to advance in scope and functionality. These gains supported double-digit organic growth in recurring software revenues as veterinarians turn to IDEXX to help them grow their practices and drive productivity. As Brian noted, we continue to work through dynamics in terms of staffing challenges and broader pressure on consumers that have impacted clinic visit growth levels. Our strong business performance demonstrates our ability to work through these near-term challenges while continuing to expand our business globally to deliver strong financial performance and advance key drivers of our long-term growth strategy and potential. Today, I'll provide an overview of IDEXX's progress against our strategic initiatives during the first quarter. Let's start with an update on our commercial efforts, which are key to driving the adoption and utilization of IDEXX's testing and software solutions. IDEXX commercial teams continue to execute at a high level, bringing a customer-first mindset to their work, helping IDEXX's customers to grow faster. Intuitive point of care testing platforms are foundational to this approach. Customer adoption of IDEXX solutions remains high globally, reflected in record first quarter global premium instrument placements for the third consecutive year. This performance, combined with the ability to retain our customers at consistently high levels by delivering an excellent user experience resulted in double-digit growth in our global premium instrument installed base, in total and individually for in-clinic chemistry, premium hematology and urinalysis platforms. This progress is aligned with the approximately 220,000 global placement opportunity we see today for our business. A key area of commercial focus is international regions that are at earlier stages of development than the U.S. and provide a relatively more greenfield growth opportunity. Leveraging the successful commercial playbook we have developed from our decades of experience in the U.S., our international sales teams continue to deliver high international installed base growth. Progress on this front is reflected in strong international premium instrument placement gains supported by continued global expansion of our new platform innovations such as ProCyte One. ProCyte One provides significant benefits compared to our legacy hematology analyzers from a more intuitive workflow with modular reagents to a smaller benchtop footprint and even back-office productivity benefits due to its paper run model, all of which combined to drive greater utilization for customers who upgrade. A recent analysis revealed a 20-plus percent uplift in runs per day for customers who upgraded from LaserCyte to ProCyte One with consistent benefits noted across major regions. Upgrades and adoption of new platforms also delivers multiplier benefits to our business, to increase customer loyalty and retention and adoption of other IDEXX in -clinic analyzers. Our continued installed base expansion in our international sector results in another quarter of strong CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Our integrated platform solutions, including benefits from our software ecosystem are well aligned to also support the formation of new practices in regions like the U.S., which continues to contribute net 0.5% to 1% to sector growth. High interest in IDEXX solutions among new practices in the U.S. has become an increasingly important driver of new and competitive placements. Our flexible and customer-friendly marketing programs like IDEXX 360 modified to appeal to new practice growth dynamics have attracted strong interest in full point of care suites with high attach rates of catalysts and increased testing across modalities. Building on our progress advancing adoption and leverage of IDEXX solutions, we continue to make solid progress advancing our ongoing innovation agenda, including the development of new platforms for diagnostic testing. The first of 2 such new testing platforms currently under development was announced recently at VMX. The IDEXX inVue Dx Cellular Analyzer, a first of its kind, Slide 3, cellular analyzer platform, is powered by advanced topics and enabled by AI that has been trained by IDEXX's global pathology network. Development of this platform is proceeding to schedule and is in its final stages as we plan to begin shipping to customers in the fourth quarter of this year. Our commercial teams have begun educating busy customers on this new piece of technology while also using it to engage with customers on other IDEXX solutions that may be relevant to their practices now. This is another multiplier of new IDEXX innovation, which helps support high reach to revenue metrics in the quarter which reflect the efficacy of our commercial playbook. Early feedback from customers across the globe remains highly positive, building up the enthusiasm experience at both domestic and international veterinary conferences. Customers have resonated with both the medical and workflow productivity benefits. Clinicians are well, for example, by the powerful technological innovations that appreciate the clinical need for solutions to ear cytology a daily practice and blood morphology, a critical element of a complete hematology exam. The feedback is consistent across general practices, specialists and corporate accounts who seek cutting-edge tools from IDEXX. We look forward to building on this highly innovative menu by delivering 5 needle aspirate testing that reflect IDEXX's high-performance standards. At IDEXX, innovation goes beyond new platforms. Our technology for life approach means that we're constantly assessing our on-market portfolio for opportunities to add value to our products with new insights, greater efficiency or improved easy use. Similar to how blood morphology insights on the IDEXX inVue DX complement our premium hematology analyzers. We recently launched a new generation of our IDEXX VetLab UA platform, which complements inVue DX. The new UA Analyzer brings a highly attractive, modernized form factor, is easier to use and features enhanced integrations with IDEXX VetLab Station and VetConnect PLUS, saving practice team's time on commonly run urine diagnostics. In the 8 essential urine parameters provided on IDEXX VetLab UA, including PH and protein merged with results from SediVue Dx driving actionable interpretive guidance on next steps that support clinicians to make informed medical decisions. IDEXX reference labs are also benefiting from recent innovations where we see momentum building with the recently launched IDEXX SNAP, a differentiated kidney injury detection test that further bolsters our best-in-class renal health offering for our customers. We've now launched in North America, U.K. and Australia and plan to launch in Europe later this year. Experience is growing with its important innovation with almost 500,000 tests ordered by over 13,000 customers since the December launch. Awareness of the test is solid, estimated at just over 50% of U.S. veterinarians based on recent survey work. Significant runway exists to increase awareness and deepen understanding of the clinical utility of this test. IDEXX's Software and Imaging business continues to perform well and is addressing significant unmet customer needs. Our cloud-first strategy to building a seamlessly integrated software ecosystem delivers workflow and communication advantages across a clinic that drive productivity while supporting double-digit growth of our profitable SaaS recurring revenue stream for IDEXX. Strong software placement growth is now virtually all via cloud-based products. It is supported by customers looking for modern tools to assess diagnostic insights, create and streamline practice workflows and communicate with an increasingly digitally native end customer. By partnering with IDEXX on these solutions, customers are increasingly freed from unrewarded administrative test to pursue their care mission for patients. Like our diagnostic platforms and menu, we're also focused on enhancing the IDEXX software ecosystem. Our recent announcement at the Western Veterinary Conference is an example of this, where we were thrilled to announce Vello, our newest Pet Owner Engagement platform, which officially went live in late March. Veterinarians increasingly tell us that their client communication processes and tools are disjointed, high friction and time-consuming. Vello provides veterinarians with a powerful tool that is directly embedded within our IDEXX Practice Management software, supporting streamlined interactions and more efficient workflows. The benefits of expanding IDEXX's vertical software suite are many, including deeper customer relationships and improved compliance that helps drive better health outcomes. Vello supports the growth of our profitable recurring software revenues while also delivering multiplier benefits to our Diagnostics business as early Vello adopters are benefiting from fewer customer no-shows and increasing their diagnostic stabilization with IDEXX. Another addition to the software ecosystem was the acquisition of GreenLine Pet, a leading digital platform that provides easy practice workflow solutions for coupon and rebate redemptions, which was completed in the first quarter. The Greenline digital platform enhances IDEXX' partnerships with leading manufacturers in the animal health pharmaceutical and nutrition space, supporting sector development through targeted rebating to customers, made possible through deep integrations with IDEXX and third-party practice management systems. By delivering additional relevant solutions to our software customers like Greenline and Vello, we're able to drive strong adoption of our deeply integrated vertical SaaS applications inside of our cloud practice management systems. Providing our customers with a single unified platform for payments, workflow and client communications to name a few applications, helps drive efficiency and remove the need to toggle between multiple applications and manual reconciliations. Not only does this accelerated adoption drive practice productivity, but it also supports greater diagnostics revenue growth and very high retention rates, thereby helping drive our key recurring revenue annuity. Overall, we're very proud of how we have advanced our strategic initiatives across multiple business areas in the first quarter, while also delivering an excellent customer experience and strong financial results. I'll now conclude our prepared remarks by thanking the 11,000 IDEXX employees for your ongoing commitment and incredible passion for our purpose-driven work. Your contribution to IDEXX not only helps deliver against our goal of providing a better future for animals, people and our planet, but also help deliver a strong start against our financial objectives in 2024.  The Companion Animal Diagnostics sector, including supporting software solutions remains highly attractive, and IDEXX teams play a critical role in providing excellent care based on diagnostic insights. As a result, we are very well positioned to deliver solid growth and financial results over the long-term horizon. So on behalf of the management team, thank you for your continued focus on enhancing the health and wellbeing of pets, people and livestock. Now let's open the line for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Christopher Schott : I'm just interested in the comments you made earlier that it seems like you're seeing both maybe some capacity challenges and macro impacting visit trends. Can you just maybe elaborate a little bit on the latter? It seems like your initial guidance for the year was a bit more optimistic on stabilization of visits. And I'm just wondering if there's any particular, either regions or trends in corporate versus private practice where you're seeing this macro piece more acutely than others? And maybe just linked to that, I know it would be a guess. But as we think about visit erosion right now, what's your best guess in terms of how much of this is just ongoing capacity dynamics at the vet versus what is actually consumer demand at this point? Brian McKeon : Thanks for the question, Chris. Maybe I can provide a little clarity on the numbers upfront and then turn it over to Jay to talk about the dynamics. We mentioned that clinical visits were relatively softer than we expected in the U.S. in the first quarter. On our last call, we had talked -- we did anticipate some weather impacts, but I think we were expecting the flattening trends that we've been planning for to emerge. And the trends coming out of the quarter were down about 1.5% versus prior year and so that was relatively softer. I would highlight internationally, we had a very good quarter. The underlying volume growth was -- continues to make progress building on what we saw in H2. So this is relatively more of a U.S. specific issue. And we did highlight, I think there are ongoing staffing challenges, capacity challenges that the practices are working through, but there may also be some impact here in the margin related to broader consumer impacts that could be impacting demand. But I'll let Jay talk to those. Jay Mazelsky : Yes, sure. The way I think about it is both from a customer standpoint, meaning the veterinarian and then the consumer or the pet owner standpoint. And we know that pet owners continue to prioritize spend for healthcare services and general spend on their pets vis-a-vis other priorities, be it building out the dinner, entertainment, travel, that sort of thing. When we -- the conversation we're having with customers is largely very positive. They're very positive on the outlook. They continue to invest in their practices.  We see that from a technology standpoint, very significant increase we saw in placements of 8%. We're seeing it in software, new practice formation. So I think customers continue to be optimistic on the outlook for the animal health industry as a whole, and this continues to remain both a durable and resilient sector. To Brian's point, we do see some ongoing staffing challenges that the practices have been working through. They see IDEXX as a partner from both a technology and solution standpoint and being able to help them. And we also potentially recognize the cumulative macro impacts which may be affecting visit trends at the margin. We have a lot -- from our approach and standpoint and orientation, we really focus on those things that we can control. We have a lot of confidence in the operational execution of our commercial teams and the product development teams from an innovation standpoint. And I think on those dimensions, we're really very positive and hitting on all cylinders. Operator : We'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Nathan Rich : Great. Can you hear me okay? Jay Mazelsky : We do. Nathan Rich : Great. I wanted to follow up on Chris' questions. I guess, you talked about the kind of end of first quarter traffic running a bit below the prior expectations. I guess, would you be able to comment on -- is April kind of in line with that 1.5% decline? And I guess more importantly, as we think about over the balance of the year, it sounds like you expect some improvement in traffic levels.  I guess just kind of relative degree of confidence in getting back to that. I know you mentioned there's maybe a days effect in there, too, that's a slight benefit. But just curious about where you may be within your different lines of business see that improvement playing out over the balance of the year? Brian McKeon : Well, I'll take a moment to just try to help with some of the first half to second half bridging. So you obviously have our Q1 results. And in my comments, I highlighted our expectations around Q2, the organic growth of 6% to 8.5%. What we're assuming in the Q2 outlook at midpoint is that we've assumed clinical visit trends similar to what we saw exiting in March. So that's the minus 1.5%. We don't comment on in-quarter trends just highlighting what we're planning in Q2. And if you take the midpoint outlook with our Q1 results, that would apply approximately 7% organic growth in the first half. The second half would imply approximately 9% organic growth.  We have some positive factors that we highlighted. One is we'll have a half days overall equivalent days benefit largely flowing through in Q3 that we noted. We'll have some select other factors that are favorable to us. We should see better lapping dynamics in areas like LPD. We're targeting higher growth in our software business. So those will be positive as well. And we do have an assumption at midpoint for relatively flattening U.S. clinical visit trends and we see a number of factors that support that assumption that I know Jay can touch on. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. Great. I mean, from our perspective, there's a couple of things that I would highlight. One is that the clinical diagnostics revenue growth rates have continued to remain strong. We saw that in Q1 at 5%, actually higher than total practice revenue growth, which is a little bit over 3%, we continue to see healthy diagnostics frequency and utilization.  So those metrics continue to remain strong. And it gets back to my earlier message on we see practices continuing to invest. They're investing in technology. They're investing in their staff. We know they're becoming more productive. We think tools like Vello, which is our client engagement software application will be a big help. It integrates very tightly with IDEXX's PIM systems. It enables a reduction in no-shows, which we know is a productivity drag on practices, and we think there will be benefits over time in terms of uplift to diagnostics. So we're doing our part in partnering with clinics, and we think over time, that will play out positively. Nathan Rich : Great. If I could maybe just ask a quick follow-up on the gross margin strength. Brian, you talked about the factors that were driving this. It sounds like some of those should be sustainable, but I'd be curious to just kind of get your view on that over the balance of the year. And you didn't change the operating margin guidance, I guess, despite the strength that you saw in the first quarter. So any dynamics that we should be thinking about as we think about the cadence over the balance of the year would be helpful? Brian McKeon : Sure. To your point, we feel very good about the start that we had in terms of the profit performance and the gross margin performance. We sustained our outlook despite taking down the high end organic growth outlook. So I think that just reflects some of the underlying operational execution benefits that we're getting and our confidence in the ability to deliver solid operating margin gains this year.  I think there are some select dynamics we noted, instrument costs being lower in Q1. Some of that is sort of an outflow of the pandemic supply chain impacts that have been alleviating. So we saw a relatively more benefit in Q1 than we will expect to see over time through the year. But I think for the most part, the performance is reinforcing the outlook that we had this year for solid comparable operating margin gains and I think reinforces that we can deliver strong financial performance as we work through some of the near-term macro dynamics that we've been highlighting. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : I want to get at the vet visit dynamic in the underlying macro, but I'll try to ask it in a different way. If we take a step back, this really started in 2022, and it was initially seen as a temporary effect of comps and working through that. We're now almost 2.5 years into this, and it continues to sort of lag behind expectations. We're still waiting for this recovery in the vet visits.  If this -- if current trends persist -- I hear what you're guiding to for second half, and I hear what you're talking about in terms of the improvement, but let's say, trends persist and we still continue to see declines. Can you talk about other levers you could you pull to sort of continue to hit numbers? In prior years, for example, you took price and you took a second price increase once. I know you've got the in-view coming, you've got operating leverage. So just talk us through sort of how you would think if visits remain under pressure, how you would address that? Jay Mazelsky : Yes. I would point to a couple of things. One is, as you highlighted, our innovation agenda, the innovation portfolio we have, I think, is very strong. It consists really across the portfolio. From a point-of-care standpoint, obviously, we plan to begin shipping inVue in Q4. We think that, that has both a direct and indirect leverage impact on the overall business.  I think our menu offering for the reference lab has never been stronger and growing. We expanded fecal antigen. We know that, that's an important preventive care screening test that really sort of builds out the overall menu [indiscernible] which is acute kidney injury and our overall -- supporting our overall renal franchise menu has been very well received in the overall sector. And then software, which has the twofer of not only being a great individual vertical business, but also the leverage and impact -- positive impact, it has on diagnostics as a whole.  I think our commercial execution continues to really be at a very high level. We see some benefits internationally where quarter on quarter on quarter, we've really seen some nice growth. I think that the investments we've made have been paying off in individual country and regions. So we saw nice performance in EMEA, for example. And I think it's just continuing to support our customers as they work through the dynamics we've highlighted. And we have confidence really in the attractiveness of the underlying demand that pet owners are generating and what the practices are doing around retaining staff and training them and seeking productivity and we think over time those trends, those clinical visit trends will improve. Brian McKeon : And Mike, I'd just reinforce, I think we've consistently demonstrated the ability to grow -- continue to grow solidly and deliver strong financial performance. And so even as we work through kind of the growth off of the higher base that was established post the pandemic and through some of the more recent kind of macro dynamics that we've been highlighting, I think we will continue to find a way to advance our growth agenda, invest behind those things that are important while continuing to deliver strong financial results. So we remain committed to that and we would build a strong track record to support that outlook. Michael Ryskin : Okay. But would you consider taking another price increase again or potentially some cost controls in the second half? Is that on the table? Brian McKeon : What we -- I think we've laid out our outlook for this year and our assumptions to reinforce, we expect approximately 5% price improvement this year, and that supports the operating margin outlook that we shared today and the strong comparable EPS growth as we invest in advancing our R&D agenda, we highlighted we're investing more there and we're excited about what's going to come. So we're confident in our financial outlook that we shared today. Michael Ryskin : Okay. And then just really quick one if I could squeeze in a follow-up. Jay, I think you said in your prepared remarks that the inVue continues to -- inVue remains on track. You talked about it at VMX, obviously. What's been some of that early feedback from vets, I realized you're still maybe 5, 6 months from actually releasing it. But you're 3 months further along than when you first sort of unveiled it. Any learnings in terms of the capabilities ramp? Talk about some of the offering that we'll be able at launch versus later on sort of what's been the reception to that? Jay Mazelsky : Yes. They've been -- customers, in general, have been very enthusiastic about the product itself. They like the fact that it addresses very high-volume, time-consuming critical use cases within the practice, either cytology and blood morphology. One of the things that customers continue to tell us is they know they should be doing more blood morphologies that they're doing just as part of a complete CBC or hematology workup. And now they feel like they're going to be able to do it because it just makes a lot of sense.  And so they're looking forward to it. And we think the awareness level is increasing and that they see this as really a worthy extension of our overall point-of-care VetLab suite. We're also just -- I would just remind folks that as part of the overall suite, we have a next generation of our VetLab Station, the IVLS station that provides workflow optimization and benefits, and we send that to customers, too, and they're very enthusiastic about that as a whole.  So really excited. I think that description, as I've laid it out, fits across both journalists within practice specialists, corporate accounts are also enthusiastic about it. I think it gets to some of the questions and the discussion we've had this morning around how do we continue to support the productivity of the practice, which at least addresses the dimension of staff retention and optimization. And I think this fits a bill on both the productivity and capacity front as well as the clinical medical front. Operator : We'll go next to Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Erin Wilson Wright : Great. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape? Do you think that there's more of an opportunity to see some more meaningful market share gains, either across the smaller practices or corporate accounts as well? And there's clearly been some disruption in terms of ownership structure, in terms of distribution changes and I'm just thinking about how you can kind of take advantage of that? And if you have seen any notable kind of share gains to date? Jay Mazelsky : Yes, we've always said, and I think it's still true now that the very competitive landscape, I would say that on a global basis, not just in our largest market, the U.S. And the -- what we focus on, obviously, is being able to support our customers, be they independent practices or corporate with a full end-to-end suite at the point of care -- patient reference labs and increasingly software. We're pleased with the progress we've made provisionally in terms of advancing the overall solutions. What customers tell us is they like the integrated nature of what we provide. They see that as a differentiator or a set of differentiators relative to our competitors, and that includes being able to take software and tie it all together that supports the workflow as they want to practice within the environment.  We think that Vello, which is our client engagement application takes that really to the next level in terms of being able to help them digitally communicate indirect with pet owners as a whole. We also are enthusiastic about new practice formation as I've indicated in my remarks where we continue to do well there, new practices, see IDEXX as a partner to be able to help them get those practices off to a strong start, and it's been an area of focus for us. So overall, I think our commercial agenda continues to advance nicely. Obviously, we're pretty transparent in terms of placements, new and competitive and how we're doing on that front, both within the U.S. and internationally, and we're doing well. Erin Wilson Wright : Okay. And then how inVue kind of fits into that strategy as well? I guess initially is the focus on existing customers or swapping out competitor equipment where you have exclusive contracts. Or can you remind us kind of on the timing to of the fine needle aspiration and that seems to be where we're getting some of the earlier feedback and is that sort of 2025? Or how do we think about the time line there? Jay Mazelsky : Yes. So a couple of questions there. The inVue from a focused standpoint, obviously, the IDEXX customers who already enjoy our VetLab suite, our obvious customers from targeting or focus standpoint, we know they'll fit right in with their workflow and already partnership they have with IDEXX.  We saw that -- by the way, we saw that with SediVue, where the mix of SediVue sales, at least initially were more focused on existing IDEXX customers. So it was a great entree into competitive accounts and opportunity to give us a fresh look, which then we leverage down the road with chemistry and hematology and other solutions. In terms of fine needle aspirate, all we've said at this point is it's next. We're working hard at it. We know customers are very enthusiastic about fine needle aspirate and the ability to really expand a set of cancer diagnostics, which is important to their clients and great practice of medicine. And we'll talk more about that as we get closer. Operator : We'll go next to Jon Block with Stifel. Jonathan Block : I don't think really -- a shocker that I'm also going to try to hit on visits and just sort of need to because your stock is largely tailored to seeming with the data. For visits, you mentioned macro capacity constraints weighing on the overall vet visits. And some of our checks seem to tease out, call it like a higher sensitivity from the pet owner. You're taking price and in many cases that, that might be marking up 2, 3, 4x somewhere in there.  So I'm just curious, anecdotally, are you identifying more sensitivity on the pet owner sticker shock? Just sort of a broader question. Did this industry overstep a bit on price over the past couple of years? And if so, Brian, do we think about your price getting back to that, I think it's 3% on your LRP, call it sooner rather than later? Jay Mazelsky : Yes. Let me -- Jon, I'll take that. The -- we obviously don't control in pricing to the [indiscernible] that's up to practices and veterinarians. So lot of things factor into that. They're investing in their staff. We think that's a good thing when they retain their staff and really upscale the fellows who are supporting pet owners, that's a long-term driver and a point of stability within practices. And I think coming out of the pandemic, that was a real challenge for them.  We continue to get back to when we have conversations with practices and customers, they're optimistic. They see some of the challenges around capacity alleviating over time. They continue to invest heavily in the business with technology, we think pricing -- their pricing helps them do that. From our standpoint, we always, from a pricing standpoint, look to maintain a good equilibrium of value for what we deliver. We continue to provide parameters and biomarkers like Cystoisospora, Cystatin B, no additional charge. So those are included in existing panels that obviously help them on the value end of the equation. But we acknowledge that the cumulative macro impacts at the margin may be affecting some pet owners. Brian McKeon : Yes. And Jon, just to reinforce Jay's point, I think we align our pricing with the value we were delivering on the underlying inflationary dynamics that we're seeing. And we'll continue to factor that in. And our outlook is consistent with what we shared earlier for 2024, which is approximately 5% net price realization globally. Jonathan Block : Okay. Sorry about that. And then let me just maybe try to throw a bunch of small ones in the second question. Brian, you talked about the vet visit data to have embedded the midpoint. I've just gotten some questions. Is it as simple as extrapolating out the negative 1.5%, call it, for the lower end, just when we think about your guidance? And then you still have this other box coming. I think that's really what can really separate almost a stop from the visit data as people are getting more excited about the premium, right? So just taking a step back, do we think about you guys like handling it in a similar manner? Just if I recall last year, I think it was grade out in the investor presentation in August, officially introduced at VMX in January and then hitting the market 9 or 10 months after that in 4Q '24 maybe just at a high level, if you can just talk about from a timing perspective when we think about that second still TBD box that you've alluded to in the past? Brian McKeon : Jon, can you just clarify your first question? I just wanted to follow what you were trying to get at when you said -- was it a full year question you're asking? Yes, just trying to clarify what... Jonathan Block : Yes. Sorry, Brian. Is it just as simple as I think and maybe hopefully, I'm just right, but the midpoint of your guide has visits down 1.5% in 2Q and then essentially flat in 2H. Is it a simple for the lower end, call it, just take that 1.5% and like extrapolate it out for 2H, and that's sort of what's call it embedded in the lower band of your CAG DX recurring. That's where I was sort of going with the first part. Brian McKeon : It's obviously a broader set of considerations, but I think directionally, your point is valid, which is -- if trends continue to be softer, that would be a factor that could be leading us towards the lower end. Jonathan Block : And then on the new box? Brian McKeon : Look, I look forward to sharing more. As we get closer to launch, we'll maintain the approach that we've used in the past that -- we'll share that when we we're closer to commercial launch. We're very excited about the inVue advancing and that's on track. And as you know, will contribute directly, and we'll have a lot of multiplier benefits to our business. And I know our sales force is very excited about that, and we are too. And we continue to advance our second platform. And we'll share more on that over time, and we see that as also being an additive driver for our business over time. Operator : We'll go next to Navann Ty with BNP Paribas. Navann Ty Dietschi : A few followups on vet visits. If you could comment on the U.S. vet industry progress on addressing shortages and mental health of vets and using more vet technicians to assist vets, has this continued? And can you discuss any progress to date? And another follow-up on the macro headwinds on the pet owner side, what are your assumptions for the full year vet visits, wellness and non-wellness, please? Jay Mazelsky : Yes. From an industry profession side, what customers tell us and what we see is that the staffing churn has largely stabilized. Coming out of the pandemic, I think there was a lot of challenges and the veterinarian pet owners responded by, I think, increasing salary and benefits and cutting back some hours. So those impacts, I think, have largely stabilized. I think practices to the extent that they were able to hire more, have hired more, in some cases, they've instituted training, more internal training programs and have taken those sort of steps. They've also, as I mentioned earlier, invested more in technology. I think they're just far more receptive around technology, software, equipment, use of our reference labs that helps them save time. Sometimes it may be 10 minutes, 15 minutes per procedure, but on the other hand, cumulatively, that matters, that I think can be highly worthwhile. Operator : We'll go next to Ryan Daniels with William Blair. Ryan Daniels : Maybe just one quick one in the interest of time. You've talked about the longer-term dynamics of higher diagnostic utilization as pets age through their life cycle. And I know you also have some data about kind of larger than normal pet population growth post the pandemic. So I'm curious if you could give us your thoughts on when we might start seeing the benefits of that flowing through in the industry in regards to diagnostic use? Jay Mazelsky : What we see is it really increases over time even with the young adult dog. So there's obviously a lot of visits, puppies and kittens. And then as they become young adult cats and dogs that both healthcare services, there's a very modest dip, but generally, healthcare services and diagnostics as both an absolute dollar amount and proportion expands. And then there's -- it grows or accelerates even more quickly as they get into the adult and geriatric stage. So our focus has been able to -- is really on accelerating that through all life stages, including young adults or things like wellness testing and exams. But it does go up over time. It's just not linear through the different stages. Okay. And with that, we'll now conclude the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you for all your questions and for participating this morning. I'll finish today's call by reiterating that IDEXX is committed to the significant multi-decade opportunity to increase the standard of care for Companion Animal Healthcare diagnostics utilization.  IDEXX's organic growth strategy is helping lead the development of our sector, and we look forward to continued high execution against our growth initiatives supported by teams from across the organization. Our growth outlook for 2024 builds off decades of investments in business capabilities that we have made and reflects ongoing sector development and financial results aligned to our long-term framework. And now, we'll end the call. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. In reviewing our second quarter 2024 results and updated 2024 guidance, please note all references to growth, organic growth and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent prior-year period, unless otherwise noted. To allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit their questions to one with one follow-up as necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions, please feel free to get back into the queue. And if time permits, we'll take your additional questions. Today's prepared remarks will be posted to the Investor Relations section of our website after the earnings conference call concludes. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, I'll take you through our Q2 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2024. IDEXX delivered solid organic revenue growth and strong comparable profit gains in the second quarter. In terms of highlights, overall revenues increased 7% organically, supported by 7% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues and 10% organic gains in our water business. Solid CAG revenue growth was driven by global benefits from IDEXX execution drivers, reflected in sustained solid new business gains, record second quarter premium instrument placements and double-digit growth in recurring veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues. Partially offsetting these benefits, CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q2 was constrained by impacts from near-term macro and sector headwinds, which contributed to a 2% decline in U.S. same store clinical visit growth levels in the quarter. IDEXX's operating performance reflected in solid comparable operating profit gains, continued to be strong in Q2. EPS in the quarter was $2.44, down 9% as reported, including a $0.56 per share impact from a $62 million discrete expense accrual related to an ongoing litigation matter. Comparable EPS growth was 15% in the quarter, ahead of our expectations supported by solid gross margin gains and benefits from lower net interest costs and shares outstanding. IDEXX continues to make progress expanding our business, advancing our innovation agenda and delivering strong comparable profit gains as we work through near-term macro and sector headwinds that continue to pressure clinic visit levels. We've updated our 2024 financial outlook to incorporate recent sector trends, which we estimate at midpoint will constrain overall organic revenue growth to the lower end of our original organic growth guidance for 2024. Our updated P&L guidance maintains our outlook for solid, comparable operating margin gains this year, and incorporates favorable adjustments for updated foreign exchange, net interest expense, and effective tax rate estimates. We'll review our updated guidance detail later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our second quarter results. Second quarter organic revenue growth of 7% reflected 7% organic CAG gains, 10% organic growth in water and improved 3% organic growth in our LPD business. CAG organic revenue growth was supported by 8% organic gains in veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues driven by 12% organic growth and recurring revenues. CAG instrument revenue increased 5% organically building on high prior replacement levels. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue increased 7% organically in Q2 supported by average global net price improvement of 5% to 5.5% with U.S. net price realization at the lower end of this range. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q2 was supported by 10% international organic gains including approximately 1% of growth benefit from equivalent days effects in international regions. Strong international growth reflects benefits from net price realization and continued solid volume gains. International growth continues to be driven by IDEXX execution reflected in strong new business gains and high premium instrument placements which supported a double-digit year-on-year expansion of our global premium instrument install base. U.S. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 5.2% in Q2, net of a 0.5% U.S. equivalent day growth headwind in the quarter. IDEXX growth was supported by solid new business gains, sustained high customer retention levels, and benefits from net price realization. IDEXX growth continues to expand at a high premium to U.S. same-store clinical visit growth levels which declined 1.8% in Q2. In the U.S., diagnostic utilization per clinical visit continues to expand solidly at the clinic level. This is reflected in a 7.5% year-on-year increase in diagnostic revenue dollars per clinical visit including diagnostics. While diagnostic frequency per clinical visit declined modestly in Q2, diagnostic frequency per wellness visit expanded 100 basis points. This partially offset lower diagnostic frequency per non-wellness visit. The decline in diagnostic frequency for non-wellness visits may reflect recent growth in fall clinical visits for pain management drug treatment which may not include diagnostics. Adjusting for these effects would imply relatively softer comparable U.S. clinical visit trends and a relatively higher IDEXX growth premium. Overall, IDEXX continues to achieve solid organic revenue growth in CAG diagnostic revenues as we work through headwinds from broader cumulative macro impacts on consumers which are likely pressuring near-term U.S. clinical visit growth levels. While we remain highly confident in the positive long-term drivers of demand for diagnostics including the future benefits that will flow from IDEXX innovation, we factored in expectations for continued pressure from lower U.S. clinical visits in the second half of 2024 and our updated full-year organic growth outlook. IDEXX execution drivers supported solid organic revenue growth across our modalities in Q2. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 8% organically reflecting solid gains in the U.S. and double-digit growth in international regions. Consumable gains were supported by 11% year-on-year growth in our global premium instrument install base reflecting strong gains across our catalysts, premium hematology and SediVue outcomes. We achieved the Q2 record 4,952 CAG premium instrument placements, an increase of 4% year-on-year compared to high prior year levels. These results were supported by continued strong growth and Premium Hematology and SediVue placements. ProCyte One momentum continues with the ProCyte One installed base increasing to over 17,000 instruments. Global Catalyst placement decreased year-on-year in the quarter, reflecting comparisons to high prior year placement levels in placement mix in international regions. Global rapid assay revenues expanded 6% organically in Q2, driven by solid gains in the U.S., including benefits from higher net price realization. Global lab revenues also increased 6% organically, reflecting solid U.S. gains and high single-digit growth in international regions. Veterinary software and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 12% as reported including benefits from a recent Greenline software and data platform acquisition. 8% overall organic revenue gains were driven by 12% organic growth in recurring revenues reflecting benefits from ongoing momentum in cloud based software placements. Water revenues increased 10% organically in Q2, driven by double-digit gains in the U.S., and continued solid growth in Europe. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenues increased 3% organically. Continued solid gains in the U.S. and Europe offset lower Asia-Pacific revenues, including impacts from reduced swine testing in China and lower herd health screening revenues. Turning to the P&L. Q2 profit results were supported by gross margin gains. Gross profit increased 8% in the quarter, as reported, and 9% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 61.7%, up 90 basis points on the comparable basis. Gross margin gains reflect benefits from net price realization, offsetting inflationary cost impacts. Software service margin gains and favorable business mix. On a reported basis operating expenses increased 28% year-on-year, including 22% of growth impact related to the $62 million discrete litigation expense accrual recorded in G&A. Excluding this impact, Q2 OpEx growth was in line with overall revenue growth, driven by increases in R&D spending aligned with advancing our innovation agenda, including new platform development. On a reported basis, operating margins were 26.3% in the quarter, including a 610 basis point impact from the discrete litigation expense accrual. On a comparable basis, excluding this impact, operating margins increased approximately 110 basis points year-on-year. EPS was $2.44 per share in the quarter, a decrease of 9% as reported, including the $0.56 per share impact related to the discrete litigation expense accrual. EPS increased 15% on a comparable basis. Foreign exchange reduced revenues by approximately $7 million, operating profit by approximately $3 million and EPS by approximately $0.02 per share in the quarter, net of a $2 million hedge gain. Free cash flow was $215 million in Q2. On a trailing 12 month basis, our net income to free cash flow conversion ratio was 99%. For the full year, we're maintaining our outlook for free cash flow conversion of 90% to 95%, reflecting estimated capital spending of approximately $180 million. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 0.7 times gross and 0.4 times net of cash as we continue to manage our balance sheet conservatively. We allocated $208 million in capital to share repurchases in the second quarter, supporting a 0.7% year-on-year reduction in diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our 2024 guidance, we've updated our full year organic growth outlook to reflect expectations for continued pressure on U.S. clinical visit trends in the second half of 2024. Our P&L outlook reinforces our full year goals for solid, comparable operating margin improvement and incorporates favorable adjustments to estimates for foreign exchange impacts, net interest expense, and our effective tax rate. Our updated full year guidance for reported revenues is $3,885 million to $3,945 million, a reduction of $15 million at midpoint. Our updated reported revenue outlook includes a favorable $15 million adjustment related to more recent foreign exchange estimates. We've updated our full year guidance for overall organic revenue growth and CAG Diagnostic organic recurring revenue growth to 6.2% to 7.8%, or approximately 7%, at midpoint. Our outlook for overall organic revenue growth continues to reflect expectations for solid CAG Diagnostics reporting revenue gains supported by IDEXX execution. This includes consistent expectations for full year global net price improvement of approximately 5%. Our updated organic growth outlook at midpoint assumes IDEXX execution growth benefits will be partially offset by continued pressure on U.S. clinical visit levels in the second half of this year similar to first half trends. We expect our H2 organic revenue growth results will benefit by approximately 0.5% overall from equivalent days effects reflecting 1% to 1.5% organic growth rate benefits in Q3. In terms of our profit guidance, our updated outlook incorporates impacts from the discrete litigation expense accrual, which we estimate will reduce full year reported operating margins by approximately 160 basis points and EPS by $0.56 per share. We will normalize for the effects of this accrual in setting our 2025 financial performance goals. Incorporating these impacts, our updated reported operating margin outlook is 28.7% to 29.0%. This reflects a consistent 40 basis point improvement in comparable operating margins at midpoint net of a negative 40 basis point impact related to the lapping of the Q1 2023 customer contract resolution payment. Our updated full year EPS outlook of $10.31 to $10.59 per share is down $0.56 per share at midpoint, reflecting the impact from the discrete litigation expense accrual. Adjustments to our organic revenue growth outlook reduce our operational EPS estimates by approximately $0.08 per share at midpoint, which is offset by approximately $0.04 in favorable foreign exchange adjustments and positive below the line benefits from refinements to our net interest expense and effective tax rate outlook. We now estimate foreign exchange will reduce full year revenue growth by approximately 0.5% and EPS by approximately $0.05 per share. In terms of our outlook for Q3, we're planning for reported revenue growth of 6% to 8%, net of an estimated 1% growth headwind from foreign exchange and incorporating approximately 0.5% in growth benefits from our recent software acquisition. This outlook aligns with an organic revenue growth range of approximately 6.5% to 8.5%, including approximately 1% to 1.5% of growth benefit from equivalent days effects. We're planning for reported operating margins of 29.5% to 30.0% in Q3, down moderately on a comparable basis. This factors in year-on-year comparisons to relatively lower prior year sales and marketing expense levels, and projections for continued high year-on-year growth in R&D spending, including support of new platform advancement. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Jay Mazelsky : Thank you, Brian, and good morning. IDEXX delivered excellent performance against our strategic priorities and strong operational results in the second quarter. As we drive development of the companion animal diagnostics sector through a new wave of innovation and high quality customer engagement. These outcomes reflect high levels of execution and position IDEXX to benefit from long term growth tailwinds, including growth in a pet population, increased pet lifespans, and an ever strengthening bond between pet owners and their pets. These enduring dynamics combined to elevate the importance of medical services and drive global expansion of companion animal diagnostics and software. As an innovation leader, IDEXX growth continues to outpace the sector as we help our customers grow faster. Our progress is reflected in solid second quarter CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth supported by key execution drivers. This includes continued solid new business gains, sustained high 97% plus customer retention rates and solid net price realization aligned with the value we deliver. IDEXX is focused on innovation and companion animal diagnostics has resulted in a highly compelling portfolio of products and services for our highly capable commercial teams to support our customers. This combination helped drive record second quarter global premium instrument placements, a double digit growth at our installed base of premium instruments, and five consecutive quarters of double digit CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth in Europe. We're delivering this performance as we work through some transitional growth headwinds that continue to pressure clinical visit growth levels. This includes ongoing staffing and productivity challenges, as well as broader impacts on pet owners in the current macro environment. As we work through these dynamics, we're continuing to deliver solid growth ahead of sector levels. Our customer engagement is helping to support gains in diagnostics, frequency and wellness visits, and continued expansion of diagnostics, utilization per clinical visit. Our customers increasingly appreciate that healthy and sustainable clinic growth begins with diagnostics. You can't assess basic health status or treat sick patients without first diagnosing and treatments, then require follow up monitoring. This has been our long term focus and we see significant underserved demand for an expanding pet population that will support long term growth for our customers in support of their mission. Today, I'll give an update on IDEXX's commercial execution and progress against our innovation strategy. IDEXX's commercial teams delivered record second quarter global premium instrument placements, growing off high prior year levels. A key driver of this growth was high interest in IDEXX products in international regions. Continued solid new and competitive Catalyst placements and strong placement growth of ProCyte and SediVue analyzers, coupled with high levels of retention and an excellent customer experience, helped deliver double digit growth in our worldwide premium instrument installed base. Growth of our loyal installed base forms the foundation for our future recurring revenues and a significant long term opportunity for growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. ProCyte is a great example of our continued momentum in expanding our customers businesses through innovation, IDEXX sales professionals continue to support customers looking to upgrade from our legacy LaserCyte system to ProCyte One in order to realize multiple benefits from load-and-go reagents that simplify workflow to a smaller footprint, that frees up valuable benchtop space and inventory benefits due to its pay-per-run model with automated fulfillment by IDEXX. In addition to driving a better customer experience, IDEXX benefits from these upgrades in the form of increased loyalty and higher CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues at customers who upgrade. This customer interest and commercial effort helped drive our ProCyte One installed base to over 17,000 in just 3.5 years since this product launch. Upgrading to ProCyte One will also position these customers to benefit from the most comprehensive point-of-care hematology result when combined with inVue Dx blood morphology. While we are gratified by the consistent high levels of placements that our commercial teams deliver, we also focus on quality placements that will drive the most incremental value to IDEXX in the form of future recurring revenues. As an example, continued high placements at greenfield accounts drive significant value as these new customers are fully incremental to IDEXX. Our commercial teams are well equipped to have these initial conversations with de novo clinics and sustained high interest that our new practice program reflects their desire to partner with IDEXX since they launched their business. IDEXX's commercial success reflects our long-term focus on bringing a high-touch direct commercial model that includes a broad set of complementary roles, including account managers, professional service veterinarians and the largest in-person field service workforce in the industry. I'm also pleased to share that the entire North American commercial team met in person for several days in July to receive in-depth training on our latest innovations including Catalyst Pancreatic Lipase Test and IDEXX inVue Dx Cellular Analyzer. As we prepare for the successful commercialization of a significant new wave of innovation our commercial teams are highly excited to begin taking orders for inVue Dx, the formal start of the commercialization process. IDEXX inVue Dx Cellular Analyzer remains on track for launch in the fourth quarter. IDEXX product development teams have moved to the infield product validation stage to ensure early customers who adopt this transformational platform can seamlessly integrate inVue into their practice workflows and have the positive user experience they have come to expect for IDEXX products and services. We are seeing encouraging early performance and utilization metrics among the small number of analyzers currently being trialed in the field. Customers are praising the usability of inVue with all sites commenting that the workflow is intuitive and simple and the results are consistent, which will help them see more patients that drive clinical visit volume growth. I'm excited to provide more updates on inVue Dx and IDEXX's broader innovation agenda at our upcoming Annual Investor Day later this month. We're also on track to launch the recently announced Catalyst Pancreatic Lipase Test in the U.S. in the third quarter and globally in Q4. The Catalyst Pancreatic Lipase Test, a single slide solution for canine and feline patients Spec to pancreatitis represents a 10 menu addition of the Catalyst platform since 2012. Pancreatitis is a common and treatable disease among cats and dogs, which can prove fatal if not caught early. Therefore, equipping veterinarians with quantitative results during the patient visit enables them to confidently diagnose and define the treatment envelope while the pet parent is still in the examination room. Our technology for life approach and the cloud-enabled in-clinic analyzers allow us to quickly ramp this highly relevant test to our more than 70,000 global Catalyst installed base. In addition to the new Catalyst Lipase Test, we'll begin shipping the Catalyst Smart QC clip in Q4. Customers are thrilled by the ability to run monthly QCs with a plug-and-go solution in other 15 minutes. Catalyst Smart QC is a great example of how our innovation is sometimes targeted at workflow optimization versus just testing new expansion. We have also begun rolling out the next generation of our industry leading IDEXX software and expect to have our installed base transition before inVue Dx begins shipping. This next generation takes our industry-leading IDEXX VetLab software and meaningfully improves the user interface and halves the number of steps needed to perform many common tasks. IDEXX software solutions are another area that delivers innovation-driven growth that addresses solutions that both improve clinic workflows and support greater utilization of diagnostics. Demand for intuitive cloud-based software solution remains high among a customer base that is increasingly reflective of younger generations who are digitally native. By leaning into this trend, IDEXX is well-positioned to continue to deliver a seamlessly integrated software ecosystem that provides efficiency gains through workflow and communication solutions. Q2 practice management orders were almost entirely cloud-based, building the foundation for strong future growth of economically attractive recurring revenues. IDEXX's attractive cloud-based solutions extend further, benefiting many areas of the practice. Facilitating payments, delivering digital workflow tools, and delivering an integrated pet owner engagement solution are just a few examples of how we're providing a robust software stack that is a win-win, delivering improved clinic productivity while driving incremental recurring revenues to IDEXX. For example, our recent launch of Vello, a pet owner engagement application, provides a first-of-its-kind pet owner engagement tool that is natively integrated into the practice management system. High interest in Vello is helping fill the sales pipeline and driving a solid increase in active customers in the first full quarter since launching the product. These customers are experiencing the benefits we saw in our early beta testers, from reduced no-shows to better compliance during clinical visits. As this customer base grows over the long-term, we see significant opportunity for Vello to help address the productivity challenges that exist at so many busy veterinary clinics, which is a meaningful benefit to our sector. We're building on the robust features of our customer engagement solution by integrating Greenline into our portfolio. Acquired in the first quarter, Greenline Pet is a leading digital platform that provides easy practice workflow solutions for coupon and rebate redemptions. The tool provides veterinary clinics with the ability to connect their customers with leading animal health, pharmaceutical, and nutrition providers, making it easier for pet owners to take exceptional care of their pets. These higher standards of care reflect the sector development that is at the center of our long-term organic growth strategy. And as the sector grows, we expect IDEXX in turn to grow even faster, disproportionately benefiting us as the leader in the space. As we conclude our prepared remarks, I'd like to thank the nearly 11,000 global IDEXX employees for your outstanding work and commitment to providing a better future for animals, people, and our planet. Your contributions are essential to the progress we've made against our organic growth strategy and to delivering another quarter of strong financial performance. Thanks to your efforts, IDEXX is well positioned to build on this momentum through the second half 2024 and well beyond as we continue to lead the development of the companion animal diagnostic sector. Before we open the line for Q&A, I'd like to remind you that we will be hosting our annual Investor Day later this month, beginning with the management dinner on Wednesday, August 14th, followed by presentations at our Global Headquarters in Westbrook, Maine on Thursday, August 15th at 8 a.m. Thursday's event will also be live streamed and recorded via idexx.com for those who cannot make it in person. This is an exciting opportunity for IDEXX leaders to provide a comprehensive update on our strategy, long-term growth opportunity, innovation cycle, and execution drivers. Participating will be members of my senior management team, including Dr. Tina Hunt, Executive Vice President, Strategy, Sector Development and Global Operations; Dr. Mike Erickson, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Point-of-Care Diagnostics and Telemedicine; Mike Lane, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Reference Laboratories and Information Technology, Michael Schreck, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Veterinary Software and Services; George Fennell, Senior Vice President, Chief Revenue Officer, and Brian McKeon, Executive Vice President and CFO. The event will last approximately 4 hours and we'll conclude with a Q&A session. With that, we'll end the prepared section of the call and open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the question. I said kind of a 2-parter around visits. I guess, first, is what do you think, in your view, is the biggest delta between the outlook you gave in 1Q and the outlook you gave today in terms of what's happened to the market over the past few months? And the second part of that is probably more forward-looking. Are you still confident and I guess the more traditional kind of 2% or 3% vet visit growth rate as being an appropriate target over time? And maybe just help bridge us from what we're seeing today to what needs to happen to get back to that more traditional growth? Thank you. Brian McKeon : Thanks for your question, Chris. So I think just revisiting the outlook that we had given earlier in the year, we saw roughly 150 basis points of headwind coming out of the first quarter and carry that through or assumptions in the second quarter in the U.S. in terms of clinical visits and highlighted as we had coming out of 2023 that we thought there would be a flattening of trends over time. We had anticipated seeing some normalization with staffing effects and kind of working through some of those dynamics and thought that the clinic outlook would flatten. I think that as we work through Q2, we've continued to see a level of headwinds. I think we're acknowledging that there may be some macro dynamics going on here that we're working through and trying to capture that in the second half outlook. So that's the principal change. I'll let Jay talk more about the long-term drivers, but we continue to see a number of very positive long-term drivers for growth in demand and pet health care, including visit trends. And so we'll talk more about that at Investor Day, but we continue to have a very optimistic long-term outlook for the growth potential in this sector. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. Good morning, Chris. Just a couple of words about the long-term trends. As Brian said, we continue to be very optimistic about that all the longer-term sort of secular tailwinds, we believe are intact. Obviously, it starts with the overall humanization of pets and that continues to strengthen appreciably and increasingly among the younger household owning pet where from a demographic standpoint, what they've shown, both in terms of intent and actual actions is willing to spend more and prioritize vis-a-vis categories like travel, entertainment going out. There's obviously a lot more, pet. So from a net adoption standpoint. If you take a look at this is really a global phenomenon. They're more and aging, and we know that as they age more is generally spent from both a health care - overall health care standpoint as well as diagnostics. Longer life spans, we'll provide an update on that on Investor Day. But we know both dogs and cats are living longer, and that's a good thing for both the pets, as well as the overall spend. And again, back to the prioritization, we think that this is a very resilient market. The pet owners are willing to spend and prioritize for the care at well-being of their pets. Maybe on a shorter term basis, just a couple of comments based on a number of ongoing conversations we have with veterinary practices there, very optimistic, and in terms of demand and the work that they're doing, they think they've made progress coming out of the pandemic around really retaining their staff, creating a more sustainable environment for both veterinarians and the veterinary technicians amongst their teams. They continue to invest in technology. We've seen that both from a software standpoint as well as point-of-care at record placements in Q2. As we said in our commentary, there are some high-level macro impacts that are affecting it likely at the margin, some moderation in clinical visits, but we're confident that we'll work through it, and we're working through it effectively as our customers. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Michael Ryskin : Hi, thanks guys. I kind of want to follow-up on that topic, but take it from a different perspective. Brian, Jay, during your prepared remarks, you talked about maybe shifting to that dynamics and you highlighted some of the diagnostics utilization trends and wellness visits versus non-wellness. I think you were kind of calling out that you were seeing less diagnostic in non-wellness, because pain management, and we assume Librela is rampant. There's visits where people come in, just get the shot and then walk out without any diagnostics tied to that. As part of that trend, I'm just wondering if maybe we could be seeing a broader shift in that channel dynamics. The pain management issue you mentioned, there's also a continuing shift to the online marketplace for therapeutics. All this can kind of lead to potentially less opportunity for diagnostics in the clinics office, because pet owners are getting their care elsewhere. I'm just wondering how you see that care delivery channel evolving and whether that could be having an impact to the growth profile. And then I'll throw in my follow-up question at the same time. You've updated the guide for this year to 7% organic. You did rounding 9% last year, and 7.5% the year before. So this is now kind of a three-year trend of pretty far below the LRP of 10% plus. We talked about vet visits. There was a point where there was a lot of concern on that supply in terms of insufficient vets and technicians out there. But it seems like this macro headwind continues to persist and refuse to get better. I'm just wondering, outside of price, what levers do you have to regain that 10%-plus LRP, and just confidence that you'll be able to get back there in 2025? Thanks. Brian McKeon : Why don't I start with your final question, because I think that will help center the discussion around visit trends, which I think was the first part of your question related to, Mike. Just in terms of the growth trends for the company. I think it's important to put them in the context of this post-pandemic period. I mean we had a 33% expansion in the business between 2020 and 2021. I would say the dynamic in 2022 that kind of played into the first half of 2023 was this capacity pullback effect at the clinics where they had trouble keeping up with the expanded demand, and it was fundamentally an impact on clinical visits. So we went from a positive 5% clinical business environment to a minus 3% environment in a relatively short period of time. And I think that, that was not foundational to the demand in the industry. I think it was this capacity dynamic and this transition from this extraordinary period of growth. And I think as we've moved forward from that, I think there has been kind of an ongoing dynamic again in this post-pandemic period related to staffing challenges and what has become a cumulative inflation impact on consumers broadly that's causing global trade-off. And all paths lead back to the fundamental dynamic that's changed is visits. And I think our premium has been quite healthy or placements net new business gains, customer retention all the dimensions that we look at in terms of how we're executing the business, we feel very good about, and we feel great about our innovation pipeline. So I think there are - as we look forward in the your question you had about moving ahead, I think we see positive long-term drivers in terms of sector trends and things that we're doing to drive demand in the business as well. So we feel very good about that. While acknowledging that we've been working through a clinical visit issue. So getting to some of the specifics that we highlighted this morning, I think one of the things we were trying to peel apart here on the visits was as you know, we look in the U.S. at the visit changes on the same-store level, diagnostic - frequency diagnostic utilization. And I think we do see some level of an impact on these metrics related to the pain mAbs. We try to pull this apart and we can see on wellness business, they're actually up year-on-year, 100 basis points, and that's been actually a trend we've seen for several quarters now. So a very healthy dynamic. When pet owners are coming into the clinic, they're doing more diagnostic testing. On normal testing those metrics were holding up through last year and where we started to see was change in those metrics beginning in Q4 and into the first half of this year, which aligns with the Librela kind of launch and kind of penetration. And so net-net, we didn't quantify this specifically, but basically, the frequency metric, which had built off of that high base expanded base in the dynamic, we think when you adjust for these type of dynamics or the pain mAbs dynamics probably sustained - continue to expand. And it might indicate there's a bit more weakness on the clinical visit front, particularly in non-wellness. And I think that's indicative of the macro headwinds that we've been highlighting. So again, I think this is, from our view, not foundational to our strategy or execution but more reflective of just the macro and the sector environment we're in at the moment. Jay Mazelsky : Mike, let me address a couple of other questions you had embedded in there. First, around the alternate channels of care. What we see from an alternate channel venue standpoint, is it's largely complementary. I'm referring to some of the bricks-and-mortar places like TractorSupply or PetIQ and some of the clinics that they have, where these are pet owners and pets that don't often have relationships with veterinarians. Keep in mind, a lot of the pharmaceutical and therapeutics have to go through, have to go through the veterinarian and does have a good deal of medicine involved in terms of testing and diagnostics and follow up that really require a professional expertise. So we think that that's a, you know, a very positive thing. You know, and in terms of your question around levers that can positively impact growth. We continue to say just to build off of Brian's comments and observations, that innovation is just so important to this industry, not just in the standpoint of diagnostics and software, but therapeutics and specialty diets all of those things. We know that practices have a lot of unmet business needs, but also unsolved clinical problems where diagnostic solutions really make impactful contributions. If you think about you can't treat before you diagnose. You can't assess just basic health line status of the pet. When you do diagnose and the patient has an acute condition or a chronic condition, and often requires follow-up monitoring. So continue to innovate and work at the front end of a brand new wave of innovation. Some of which we've announced, including, you know, in view shipping in Q4 and Smart QC and pancreatic lipase or our catalyst platforms. Vello software to staff and be - there's just a significant amount of innovation that veterinarians can use as part of their tool set to continue to treat patients better. And we note that they look for that and as these short-term challenges are mitigated from a practice capacity challenge as well as the macro impacts that we believe that the growth prospects are excellent for the company. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Erin Wright : Great. Thanks. If you can speak to it, I guess, what was the nature of the legal charge and what's ongoing there? Is that a customer related relationship? Is there more to come on that front? And then your ability, though to control costs here is impressive. And that's obviously excluding the legal charge in the quarter. But can you talk about those levers you have to control costs and your ability to do that and until what we see, you know, until we see kind of things normalized from a market perspective. Thanks. Brian McKeon : Great. Thanks for your question, Erin. Regarding the ongoing litigation matter, as we noted, we had a $62 million discrete expense accrual in the quarter. As a policy, we don't comment on ongoing litigation matters. We did include disclosures in the footnotes of the press release, and we have as well, disclosures that you can refer to in our first quarter 10-Q and our second quarter 10-Q in terms of the nature of this, but this was a, a an issue related to royalty payments over time. And we are, you know, what we've updated is our best estimate of the probable loss from that matter. In terms of your question on, operating expense leverage, I think, you know, adjusting for these items, I think you can see that we've continued to do a good job of adapting our, business financial performance to the growth environment that we're working through in terms of some of the sector headwinds for delivering strong execution, strong underlying comparable operating margin gains. We had expense growth that was basically in line with our revenue growth and very much focused on the things that we're doing to drive future growth through R&D agenda and our commercial investments. So as we've done consistently in the past, we have the ability to adapt and ensure we're prioritized against our long-term growth while delivering good financial performance, and we're able to do that again in the first half, and that's reinforced in our full year outlook as well. Jay Mazelsky : Just a couple words to add to Brian's comments around the overall cost management. We continue to invest very heavily in those areas that we think are important to the long-term growth. The company, R&D, obviously, we're working through some significant new innovations, and so we don't want to starve that, and we're feeding that where there are commercial investments from territory expansion standpoint. We're obviously very excited to be able to invest in those areas. We see a very good return. What I would also say from a business and business model standpoint, these are businesses that have scale and that lend themselves the productivity in the investments from an automation and digitization standpoint and just overall network standpoint, whether you look at the Reference Labs. Obviously, the software business for us is a - it's a fast-growing business with very good drop-through, and so that's another lever that we have. But we're disciplined. We're able to adjust our expense and expense profile to whatever environment we're in. Erin Wright : And then my follow-up is on innovation. Can you just remind us what's embedded in your guidance as it relates to inVue contribution this year? And it sounds like you're still on track in terms of your timing, but also F&A, when you anticipate that launch? And then also the timing of where you stand in terms of your other platform launch. I guess, should we expect to hear something about that potentially at your Investor Day? Thanks. Brian McKeon : Erin, just to your point on the guidance, we've captured the expectations for the Q4 launch of inVue, and as you know, it's principally an instrument introduction. At that point, the recurring revenue will build over time. Jay Mazelsky : And as is our policy, we'll talk about innovation as we get closer to launch. We look forward to Investor Day, and we'll just provide an update in terms of the overall company strategy and where we are from an innovation agenda standpoint, so look forward to having that conversation. Operator : We'll move to our next question from Jonathan Block with Stifel. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Jonathan Block : Thanks, guys. Good morning. I'll just break apart my questions. I guess, Brian or Jay, I get the ongoing headwind from clinical visits, but when we isolate the U.S. IDEXX CAG Dx recurring premium that we've laid out a bunch of times. In other words, it sort of looks at the growth, sort of looks at the growth, X visits, X price. I get a premium of around 250 basis points this quarter. It's the lowest I can remember. It looks like an ongoing deceleration for roughly the past 10 quarters. So can you talk to that trend and what might be behind it? And then, you know, importantly, should we see that trend start to reverse course arguably in 2025 in the earlier days of the inVue launch? And then I'll ask my follow-up. Thanks. Brian McKeon : Yes. Thanks for your question, John. I think the - we've increasingly kind of broken down these metrics on an adjusted basis. We have a similar number to what you have if you're taking out the price in the days effects and comparing two clinical visits about 250 basis points. I think one item we noted, which I know you've been noting in your research, is there is this dynamic of the pain mAbs, a follow-up visits which we capture in our visit number and so I think that could particularly in the first half of this year be indicate that the underlying visits themselves maybe a bit softer relative to the visits that would have diagnostics and the premium might be that much stronger. So I think that the net of that as the premiums held up quite well from our lens, I think that we feel good about the key things that drive that. The net new business gains, customer retention levels, obviously, had a solid net price realization aligned with the value we're delivering. And so I think we're - we feel positive on that front. And factors like introduction of innovation are critical to go to helping to increase engagement with our customers to get the multiplier benefits that come from IDEXX innovation and leverage of our ecosystem. And so, I think we're looking forward to the InVue launch and the other initiatives that Jay had highlighted and we had something that can be intend to be a positive long-term driver for us. I'd also highlight just the solid performance internationally as well for the company. So it was a 10% overall growth organically tactics recurring there was a day's, present days had a benefit, but very solid growth, volume growth continues to be very positive, and we have excellent progress on issuer replacements, which will be a strong indicator of our long-term growth potential. So I think we're feeling very good about the execution metrics, and as we work through some of the visit headwinds that we've highlighted. Jonathan Block : That was great color. Thanks, Brian. And for my second one, look you guys have done a great job and this year holding the EPS in light of the lighter revenue and some tax and some interest expense? How do we view that, Brian and it just better call overall efficiency from the company? Or do you think about any projects or initiatives it might come out at 2024 and go into 2025? And then the second sort of tag on question would be Jay just taking a step back and this goes back to sort of that pain mAbs thesis that we had a little bit. But is there anything to concerning about call it a wallet share battle, right? I mean just that the fact that a pet owner might be spending a $1,000 in cash and pay meds per annum, or atopic dermatitis per annum, and when we think about some of the potential accompanying diagnostic testing that that might suffer around the edges. Thanks for your time guys. Jay Mazelsky : Yes. Let me answer to your second question first, and then I'll turn the front end part of the question to Brian. We aren't concerned about that to with from a diagnostics utilization standpoint. We think it remains a pretty - it's remained pretty constant from the launch of the payments themselves, primarily as a patient visit growth phenomenon that we spoke to related to some capacity challenges that practices are working through as well as the macroeconomic impacts. When you take a look at wellness, for example, we've seen the diagnostic and closure of 100 basis points. And Brian spoke to the effect of payment on the non- wellness, which is where we cataloged or characterize that. So when they're coming into the practice, they're using diagnostics and they're using diagnostics, both for wellness and non-wellness. So we haven't seen any evidence of that cannibalization impact. Jay Mazelsky : Hi, John, your question on the margins, if I got that right, I think if the underlying performance that we've had this year reflects solid gross margin momentum. There are a number of drivers there. I think we've had ongoing benefits from cost management, things like labor productivity initiatives. software business as it's growing as meaningful to us. The business mix overall, just solid growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues and growth in in-clinic revenues is a positive factor. And so - and just ongoing productivity in our operations functions coming out from a period where there was relatively more inflation. So, I think we feel that's been a consistent driver for us as a Company and we look forward to building on that as a foundation of how we can continue to improve our comparable operating margin performance. Operator : We'll move to our next question from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Jonathan Block : Hi. Thank you for taking the question and I am kind of going to go continue to theme about OpEx management and maybe slower growth relative to history. So, just as we look I mean I've tracked your market share gains over the last 10 years. And in Reference Labs, I think I've seen from like 40 to into the 50s, in terms of market share gains, do you think that we still have a lot of that left? Or do you think most of the growth is going to have to come via innovation and maybe just creating growth in new markets and really work on utilization in-clinic. And then I'll just ask my second question upfront. I usually, when I look at gross margins, you did beat me by 70 basis points. I usually look at consumables and Reference Labs as being the big drivers. I think one of the only one of those beat me. So just in terms of how you kind of got to that gross margin leverage. Thank you. Jay Mazelsky : I'll take the front-end of your question and have Brian address the gross margin piece. David, if you take a look through the years, most of our growth has actually come through same-store sales. So we do very well competitively. We're pretty transparent in terms of disclosing it up and then and the progress we make, but we look from a growth algorithm standpoint to drive diagnostics utilization. Now a lot of that happened through innovation. There's also a big Technology for Life component that. But if you think about catalyst, for example, that tend to handle parameters 10 new slide over the last 12 years. So we know customers are just using more of that. If that means that the growth profile of the Company from a from a Reference Lab standpoint, the same phenomenon, if you think about critical antigen as an example of a quick growing category within our Reference Lab business, very important foundational part of wellness. We continue to expand that menu tapes and more recently, though, SaaS breast. So I've used more because it has more clinical value. That's how we think about it. Obviously, new platforms opened up a completely new, no retail space for us. And that's another element of our growth algorithm and the Investor Day Brian always - he always dissect sort of put some of the pieces together to show where that growth comes from the U.S. and internationally. Brian McKeon : Yes, indeed, even if in your margin question, I think in the quarter we highlighted that we had benefits from net price realization that offset inflationary cost impacts of software service margin gains and favorable business mix, which has driven by solid VetLab growth. I would highlight, I think we had strong flat margins in the prior year. And part of that was we were we were ramping staffing. So I think - some of the lab margins to the underlying productivity is very good. It was muted by a bit of a compare dynamic. But I think overall, I feel very good about the gross margin performance. Jay Mazelsky : Now, I'll conclude the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you to everyone on the phone for your participation in this morning's event. I'm very pleased to share another quarter of solid financial results as we continue to advance our strategy to drive development to the companion animal diagnostics sector and unwavering focus on innovation and our customers. Looking ahead, we remain excited about the significant long-term opportunity to enhance standards of care for companion animal. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. We look forward to seeing many of you at Investor Day. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release, which may also be found by visiting the Investor Relations section of our website. In reviewing our second quarter 2024 results and updated 2024 guidance, please note all references to growth, organic growth and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent prior-year period, unless otherwise noted. To allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit their questions to one with one follow-up as necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions, please feel free to get back into the queue. And if time permits, we'll take your additional questions. Today's prepared remarks will be posted to the Investor Relations section of our website after the earnings conference call concludes. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today I'll take you through our Q3 results and review our updated financial outlook for 2024. IDEXX delivered solid organic revenue growth and strong comparable profit gains in the third quarter. In terms of highlights, overall revenues increased 6% organically supported by 7% organic growth in CAG diagnostic recurring revenues and 13% organic growth in our water business. Organic revenue gains were supported by benefits from IDEXX execution drivers reflected in consistent solid new business gains, sustained high customer retention rates and double-digit growth in our premium instrument install base. While not reported in our quarterly results, IDEXX secured nearly 700 orders for our new In View Analyzer which supported strong growth in EVI metrics that will position the company to build on this momentum, partially offsetting these benefits, CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q3 was constrained by impacts from near-term US macro and sector headwinds. As we'll discuss, we're updating our full year organic revenue growth guidance to reflect expectations for continued near-term macro and sectoral pressure in the US and to incorporate estimated negative impacts from recent severe weather events. IDEXX continues to deliver strong profit performance as we work through these dynamics reflected in solid comparable operating margin gains in Q3, keeping us on track to achieve our full year operating margin goals. Solid revenue growth and operating margin gains supported EPS of $2.80 per share in Q3, up 11% as reported and 12% on a comparable basis. We'll review our updated guidance detail later in my comments. Let's begin with a review of our third quarter results. Third quarter organic revenue growth of 6% was driven by 6% organic revenue gains in our CAG business and 13% organic growth in water; partially offset by 2% organic declines in LPD. CAG organic revenue growth was supported by 6% organic gains in veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging revenues driven by 11% organic growth in recurring revenues. CAG instrument revenue decreased 9% organically reflecting comparisons to record prior year placement levels and near-term impacts from our commercial focus on IDEXX in view order generation, which will primarily benefit 2025 reported instrument revenues worldwide. CAG diagnostic recurring revenue increased 7% organically in Q3. This includes approximately 1% of global equivalent day growth benefit in the quarter related to increased shipping days in our in-Clinic Business. Q3 CAG Diagnostic Recurring revenue growth was supported by average global net price improvement of approximately 5% with US. net price realization of approximately 4%. US net price realization includes impacts from the successful extension and expansion of three major customer agreements in 2024. These agreements will provide long-term incremental volume growth benefits for IDEXX as we expand our business relationships with these customers. CAG diagnostics recurring revenue growth in the third quarter was supported by 10% international organic gains. International growth reflected benefits from net price realization, continued solid volume gains and approximately 0.5% of positive equivalent days effects. International growth was driven by IDEXX execution reflected in continued strong new business gains and high premium instrument placements which supported a double-digit year-on-year expansion of a global premium instrument install base. US CAG diagnostic recurring revenue organic growth was 5% in Q3 including approximately 1.5% of growth benefit from equivalent days effects. US growth was supported by continued solid positive growth contribution from new business gains, sustained high customer retention levels and benefits from net price realization. IDEXX's US growth expanded at a solid premium to comparable US same store clinical visit growth levels. In the US. we continue to work through macro and sector dynamics which contributed to a 2.1% decline in same store clinical visit growth in Q3, including a relatively higher 3.4% same store decline and more discretionary wellness visits. Overall US clinical visit growth levels include an estimated 1% to 1.5% growth benefit from the ramping of pain medication visits over the last year, which typically do not include diagnostics. This is added to the near-term clinical visit headwind effect for IDEXX's US CAG business. For pets visiting US clinics, pet owners continue to demonstrate interest in a higher standard of care despite macro pressures. If we adjust US Sector metrics for the estimated pain medication impact on clinical visits and diagnostic frequency, we continue to see an increase in the percentage of visits that include at least one diagnostic. Over the last 12 months, the percentage of clinical visits with core blood work inclusion has also sustained at elevated levels following the accelerated expansion seen during the pandemic. These trends reinforce that the primary headwind to IDEXX's growth in the near-term remains pressure on clinical visit growth. Given recent trends and our updated full year organic growth outlook, we factored in expectations for continued near-term constraints on CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth from US macro and sector impacts. IDEXX continues to achieve solid organic growth and strong financial performance as we work through these near-term headwinds. We're highly confident in the positive long-term drivers of demand for diagnostics including the future benefits that will flow from IDEXX innovation as we continue to execute towards our business strategy aligned with raising standards of pet healthcare globally. In terms of growth by modality, third quarter results were supported by strong global gains in consumable revenues. At IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 11% organically reflecting double digit gains in the US and international regions including benefits from increased equivalent shipping days effects. Consumable gains were supported by 10% year-on-year growth in our global premium instrument install base, reflecting strong gains across our Catalyst, Premium Hematology and SediVue platforms. We achieved 4,128 CAG global premium instrument replacements in Q3, a decrease of 443 units or approximately 10% compared to record prior year levels, while securing 691 orders for our new IDEXX in view analyzer in North America. We're on track for initiation of shipments of in view in Q4 with expectations for approximately 50 to 100 shipments this year with the bulk of the advance orders targeted for delivery in 2025. Global Rapid Assay revenues expanded 6% organically in the third quarter reflecting solid global gains including benefits from net price realization and positive equivalent shipping Days effects. Global lab revenues increased 2% organically in Q3 net of a modest equivalent days headwind reflecting low single digit gains in the US and solid growth in international regions. Reference Lab results adjusted for days effects were supported by modest volume growth aided by new business gains which offset pressures related to macro and sector conditions constraining same store sales levels. Net price gains in our Reference Lab line of business in Q3 were moderated by impacts from major new customer agreements which will benefit long-term. Reference Lab Growth Veterinary Software services and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 11% as reported including benefits from our recent Greenline software and data platform acquisition. 6% overall organic revenue gains were driven by 11% organic growth in recurring revenues reflecting benefits from ongoing momentum in cloud-based software solutions. Water revenues increased 13% organically in Q3 supported by double digit gains in the US and continued solid growth in Europe. Livestock, poultry and dairy revenues decreased 2% organically as strong gains in the US were offset by lower Asia swine testing and herd health screening revenues. Turning to the P&L, Q3 profit results were supported by solid gross margin gains. Gross profit increased 9% in the quarter as reported and 9% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 61.1% of 140 basis points on a comparable basis gross margin gains reflect favorable business mix including benefits from high growth and consumable revenues, lower instrument costs and favorable impacts from growth in veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging recurring revenues. Operating expenses increased 7% in the quarter on a reported basis and 8% on a comparable basis. OpEx growth was driven by increases in sales and marketing expense and RD spending aligned with advancing our growth and innovation agenda. Operating margins were 31.2% in the quarter, up 110 basis points year-on-year as reported and 100 basis points on a comparable basis. EPS was $2.80 per share in Q3, an increase of 11% as reported and 12% on a comparable basis. Foreign exchange increased revenue and operating profit by approximately $1 million and EPS by approximately $0.01 per share in the quarter net of a $1 million hedge gain. Free cash flow was $192 million in Q3. On a trailing twelve-month basis. Our net income to free cash to a conversion ratio was 91%. For the full year, we're maintaining our outlook for free cash flow conversion of 90% to 95% while updating our full year outlook for capital spending to approximately $160 million, reflecting lower projected spend and project timing. Our balance sheet remains in a strong position. We ended the quarter with leverage ratios of 0.7 times gross and 0.4 times net of cash. In the third quarter, we allocated 225 million in capital to share repurchases, supporting a 1.1% year-on-year reduction in diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our 2024 guidance, we've updated our full year overall organic revenue growth outlook to 5.3% to 6% and our outlook for CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth to 5.8% to 6.4%. At midpoint, this reflects a reduction of 1% to 1.5% compared to our prior full year organic revenue growth outlook, primarily driven by recent US Macro and sector trends, constraining visits and demand at the clinic level. This outlook incorporates Q3 results and reflects expectations for continued pressure on US CAG diagnostic recurring revenue growth in Q4 related to macro and sector trends and recent severe weather impacts in Q4 at midpoint. The updated outlook reflects expectations for overall organic revenue growth of approximately 3%. This aligns with a Q4 midpoint expectation for global CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth of 3.5% to 4% net of an estimated 0.5% of negative effect from severe weather impacts in the US. We expect global net price improvement and CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues of approximately 4% to 4.5% in Q4, including effects from new business agreements. With a consistent outlook for approximately 5% full year global net price realization. Our updated full year guidance for reported revenues is $3.865 billion to $3.890 billion, a reduction of $38 million at midpoint. Our updated reported revenue outlook includes a favorable $15 million adjustment related to more recent FX estimates. In terms of our profit guidance, our outlook for 28.7% to 29% in reported operating margins reinforces our full year goals for solid comparable operating margin improvement. Our full year reported margin outlook incorporates effects from the discrete litigation expense accrual recorded in Q2, which will reduce full year reported operating margins by approximately 160 basis points and EPS by $0.56 per share. Excluding this impact and FX effects at midpoint, our operating margin outlook reflects a consistent 40 basis point to 50 basis point improvement in comparable operating margins net of a negative 40 basis point impact related to the lapping of the Q1 2023 customer contract resolution payment. Our updated full year eps outlook of $10.37 to $10.53 per share is consistent with our prior EPS guidance at midpoint. At midpoint we've incorporated approximately $0.14 and negative EPS impact from the reduction to our organic revenue growth outlook offset by $0.02 in favorable foreign exchange adjustments, $0.01 in favorability related to updated interest expense estimates and a positive $0.11 per share benefit from improvement in our outlook for our effective tax rate. Our updated effective tax rate estimate includes approximately 0.5% of full year rate benefit or approximately $0.06 per share from a non-recurring tax reserve release we expect in Q4 as a result of the lapsing of an applicable statute of limitation. That concludes our financial review. I'll now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Jay Mazelsky : Thank you Brian and good morning. IDEXX delivered against our strategic priorities in the third quarter including strong profit growth as we advanced a robust innovation agenda supported by a high touch commercial model. These pillars of our organic growth strategy position IDEXX to continue to lead the development of the companion animal diagnostics sector over the long-term while supporting solid organic revenue growth in the near-term. Third quarter CAG diagnostics recurring revenue growth was supported by sustained IDEXX execution growth drivers including solid net new business gains, customer retention rates sustaining at over 97% and a net price realization aligned with our expectations including impacts from extens expansions in corporate accounts. Performance was also supported by double digit growth in our premium instrument installed base reflecting high interest by practices around the world in adopting IDEXX technology to obtain differential clinical insights. These consistent growth drivers reflect the benefits from our decades long strategic commitment to focusing and integrating on companion animal diagnostic assays instrumentation software supported by a highly capable and tenured commercial organization. As Brian noted, US Sector and IDEXX US growth has been moderated by cumulative macro pressures on pet owners which has pressured visit and demand trends in U.S. clinics. The results we are providing this morning reflect excellent execution from teams across IDEXX in a more challenged macro environment. We remain confident in the enduring positive secular growth tailwinds that create an attractive growth opportunity for our sector over time. From a growing global pet population to longer pet lifespans and increased opportunities to improve the quality of our pets lives, the future growth opportunity and the value of companion animal medical services remains highly compelling, further enabled by IDEXX innovations and commercial focus. These secular trends position companion animal diagnostics as the fastest growing area in the vet clinic and a key driver of medical services and practice profits. Today I'll review IDEXX'S progress against our strategic objectives and how strong commercial and operational execution helped deliver excellent financial performance in the quarter. Customers seek insights on both new existing diagnostic tests that support disease detection, interpretation and care management and ways to optimize clinic workflows to increase staff productivity. They rely on IDEXX commercial professionals who bring subject matter expertise and best practice benchmarks to help them achieve their practice objectives. The result is a sustained trend of diagnostics revenue growth outpacing overall clinic revenues as well as high levels of retention and sector leading levels of customer satisfaction. IDEXX commercial teams delivered solid third quarter global premium instrument placements across regions and platforms. Building on high prior year levels. These placements supported the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit premium instrument installed base growth on a worldwide basis as well as for our international regions. In the US the continued strong pace of competitive catalyst placements coupled with overall placements and including IDEXX inVue Dx preorders resulted in very strong year-on-year EVI gains highlighting the high quality of placements in the period and expected future consumable revenues. In Europe, continued strong net customer gains and premium installed base growth supported a sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit CAG diagnostic for recurring revenue growth, highlighting the benefits from our maturing European sales organization. These are just a few examples of the growth and value our teams are delivering aided by a new wave of IDEXX innovation. Customer interest in partnering with IDEXX was also reflected in the three major corporate account relationship expansions secured this year. These extensions position IDEXX to benefit from volume gains as new business is brought into the extended agreements. These expanded relationships will benefit growth across our modalities over time. The extension and expansion of these key account agreements demonstrate IDEXX's ability to deliver value to customers of all types and sizes as these partnership models are increasingly centered on organically driven growth versus through clinic acquisition. In addition to serving strong demand for our current on market products, commercial execution also includes supporting demand for upcoming IDEXX innovations which is especially relevant now given the early stages of our new wave of innovation. As we sit here today, IDEXX is on the cusp of delivering the newest significant piece of innovation. The IDEXX inVue Dx Cellular Analyzer, which remains on target for a Q4 launch. Our commercial teams have been engaging with customers highlighting the benefits of this transformative new in clinic testing platform and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Since beginning to take orders in North America at the end Of July, the IDEXX commercial team has taken close to 700 inVue Dx pre orders in Q3. This demonstrates the high value that clinicians place on the new diagnostic insights they will receive as part of the launch menu with ear cytology and blood morphology in the easy use they attach to slide free workflow. Early customer enthusiasm for inVue Dx is very high as they see inVue as a transformative point of care platform. Additionally, we started to take preorders in select international geographies in Q4 as we build global demand and keep in mind the value of the IDEXX InView DX analyzer will expand beyond ear cytology and blood morphology over time. Designed as a technology for Life platform, the InView DX menu will expand in 2025 as we add F&A lumps and bumps capabilities. This menu expansion will help address the approximately 25 million dogs around the world that we estimate would benefit from an oncology diagnostics as part of a clinical visit. This opportunity highlights the reason that we focus on purpose-built platforms as an expanded menu over time grows both medical and economic value similar to our catalyst platform beyond InView DX. IDEXX's in clinic business also continues to benefit from innovation and in September we began shipping Catalyst Pancreatic Lipase Lights to customers in North America with the global rollout beginning with Europe in Q4 and extending to other regions over 2025. The catalyst pancreatic Lipase Test, a single slide solution for canine and feline patients suspected of pancreatitis, represents the 10 menu addition to the Catalyst platform since 2012. This most recent example of our technology for life innovation strategy delivers improved functionality and diagnostic insights to our customers, all while using IDEXX analyzers that have already been purchased and built clinical workflows around. This strategy not only increases the medical value of an IDEXX analyzer to our customers, enabling them to deliver improved standards of care, but also helps drive utilization and increases the economic value to IDEXX of a premium instrument placement. Early feedback from customers in North America has been extremely positive for this quantitative test. With over 3,000 customers already utilizing the slide for dogs and cats, this important diagnostics test will soon be available to our entire 72,000 plus catalyst installed bays globally. Also at the point of care, IDEXX Catalyst SmartQC launched recently in North America. It will be shortly followed by Global Romp. SmartQC greatly simplifies and streamlines the monthly Catalyst quality control process. Early indications estimate SmartQC is 90% faster than the existing process. This is yet another example of our focus on bringing innovations to our customers that enhance workflows and unlock critical capacity. IDEXX teams continue to advance work towards the 2025 launch of the IDEXX Cancer Diagnostic Screening Panel at IDEXX Reference Labs. Launching initially with lymphoma detection and 2025, the IDEXX Cancer DX Panel will expand over three years to cover the six most common cancers which represent greater than 50% of canine cancer cases and $1.1 billion addressable revenue opportunity. Extensive research has shown that both veterinarians and pet owners see value in the medical insights that come from oncology screening and are highly likely to adopt this new technology. We look forward to sharing more updates on these critical pieces of innovation as we get closer to launch. Complementary to our diagnostic solutions, IDEXX software solutions provide customers with robust, intuitive products that support greater diagnostics utilization while simplifying workflows at each stage of the pet owner visit, thereby helping customers unlock capacity for more value-added work. Veterinary clinics see tangible benefits from cloud-based software technologies and IDEXX meets these needs with our broad portfolio of cloud native products from practice management systems that are tailored to the practice size and needs to workflow management tools. The result of this fit between IDEXX software products and customer needs resulted in high double digit growth in cloud based product placements which once again comprised over 95% of total software placements. Momentum for software business remains very strong with quarterly placements growing sequentially through Q3, while future placements are supported by strong bookings and pipeline aided by increased commercial productivity and corporate account interest. These trends are a leading indicator for future DevSoft and diagnostic imaging. Recurring revenue growth as a growing PIMS installed base is the gateway for customers to benefit from our expanding vertical SaaS offerings. These include workflow and pet owner engagement tools, payment processing and other productivity enablers. We are pleased by the early interest in Velo, our modern Pet owner engagement application with deep integration into IDEXX PIMS. As a quarter end we had over 300 enrolled and active practices and excellent pet owner engagement is measured by higher clinical visits, clinical revenue and diagnostics usage post implementation based on a robust pipeline. We look forward to growing vel's clinic user base by more than double by year end. As we shared at Investor Day. We have an exciting development roadmap for Velo to further address practice pain points with pet owner communications while helping to further drive visit growth and diagnostics utilization. We look forward to providing updates as we advance our software strategy and grow the related high margin recurring revenues. As we conclude our prepared remarks, I'd like to recognize the IDEXX employees who are working hard to serve veterinarians and pets in areas impacted by Hurricane, Helene and Milton. Our lab operations team took proactive measures to protect employees, mitigate service disruptions, and provide critical diagnostic services to advance care for pets in needs. We stand ready to support our customers impacted by these hurricanes as they look to rebuild their practices and resume operations. Now let's please open the line for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you so much. This is Katerina on for Chris. Thank you for taking your question. So first, you touched upon this earlier in the prepared remarks, but can you maybe just elaborate a bit on the drivers of the reduction outlook and the step down in 4Q? I guess what's the rough split between the weather things you mentioned and the underlying US macro versus anything else want to call out? And then I guess second question is just on vet visits more broadly, can you just elaborate a bit on what's the biggest delta I guess between the underlying outlook you gave in 2Q versus the one you're giving now? I guess what's different in the market and what's driving this kind of worsening macro environment? And where are you expecting to see the most impact? Thank you so much. Brian McKeon : Thanks for your questions on Q4. Just to clarify the commentary, we highlighted an outlook for organic growth overall of about 3% and CAGDX recurring revenue growth of 3.5 to 4%. The 3.5% to 4% is net of a estimated 0.5% growth rate impact from the hurricane. So if you normalize for that it is 4% to 4.5% and that is actually aligned with our outlook for price benefit. So in Q4 we're basically looking at normalized for weather, relatively flat volume. It is similar to the trends that we saw coming out of Q3. It incorporates a similar outlook for clinical visits that we saw in Q3X the weather impact. There is some impact from weather and so it really is more reflecting the trends that we saw in the third quarter. I think the one element in the third quarter that was somewhat different than we anticipated, we saw relatively more kind of pressure on end clinic demand in terms of just independent of clinics, some compression on that. We tried to highlight in our comments that the for pets coming into the clinic frequency is sustaining. It's actually up in wellness. It's when you adjust for the pain med effect. It's. It's actually up in non-wellness as well. And so I think that is very encouraging that there's still a lot of interest in diagnostics for the pets coming in. It's not expanding like it had historically. I think that's probably our, an element that we're still working through. And again, we think that's more near-term macro impacts that will both on the visits front and in terms of some of these demand impacts we think we'll be able to work through over time. But in the near-term we're just incorporating these trends in our balance of your outlook. Jay Mazelsky : Let me address your question about the clinical visit piece. As Brian indicated, we continue to attribute that to the near-term macro and sector pressures. Clearly from a macro standpoint there's the cumulative pressures of inflation and not just affecting animal health, but across the economy as a whole. We continue to see, that at the pet owner level there's a great deal of resilience. I think pet owners continue to prioritize the care for their pets at the, at the expense of other discretionary categories. But that's not to say that they're immune to these broader macro pressures, especially at the margin. we think that from an overall clinical visit standpoint it will normalize over time. all the, I think sector drivers around pet population growth, pet longevity, human pet bond, aging pets which will, consume more care are important, important support to the overall clinical visit trends. And then that our own innovation and the contribution that our own innovation will play both from a direct and leverage standpoint as, as we add capabilities to practices that support these long-term trends will drive the increase in utilization. Operator : The next question is from Michael Riskin with Bank of America. Michael Riskin : Great, thanks for taking the question guys. First to start, the reference lap number came in particularly weak in the quarter. I think we were a little bit surprised. That was the biggest delta. And during your performance remarks you made some comments about how there was some impact to price in reference lab from those three major customer agreements. Could you expand on that a little bit? Is that, I mean, I think we kind of can read between the lines that there was a little bit of price to win the contract. Is that standard operating procedure? Were these a little bit more Outsized than normal, just in general. Is that something you're seeing a little bit more pushback on in terms of price or if there's anything else on Reference Lab to call out? Brian McKeon : Thanks, Mike. Maybe I could just set context on the numbers in the quarter and then allow Jay to talk about the dynamics. In reference Labs, we had 2.4% growth organically. We highlighted there was actually a day's headwind effect in labs. The benefit that we saw in the quarter was all related to shipping days. So normalized roughly 3% growth. And we highlighted that volume growth was actually positive. So to your point, there is a level of effect on lab price realization, which is a good news item in that we this year had three major new customer extensions and expansions and that will have long-term bond growth benefits for IDEXX. And you know that that's captured in kind of our gross to net pricing effect. And you see some of that in the Q3 numbers in labs. But the underlying health of the business is quite solid, particularly with some of the pressures we've seen on things like wellness testing. So Jay can expand on that? Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, I think there's a couple ways of looking at this. The execution drivers at the Reference Lab business continue to be really strong. As Brian indicated, we have seen modest volume growth. There's new business gains and very high customer retention levels. The price gains were moderated by these major new customer agreements and expansions and extensions and they will benefit the company and the business over the longer term through volume grades. Keep in mind that the Reference Labs is relatively more indexed to wellness testing. We know that wellness testing has been more pressured. We saw the decline of 3.4% in the U.S. there hasn't been change in any of the mix that we've described over time. And we're very optimistic about the innovation agenda for the Reference Labs. We take Fecal antigen and Cystathin B for kidney health and the IDEXX cancer diagnostics in 2025. Really continue to position that modality in a highly differentiated way. And just getting back to my prior comment, clinical visits will normalize over time. Michael Riskin : Okay. And then if I can squeeze in the follow up, just want to expand more on price in general. You talked about five for the quarter. I think you're kind of sticking with 5 for the year. 5% price. 4Q is going to be a little bit lighter than that. Four, four and a half. I know some of that is probably tied to timing of the price increases you took last year. Again, correct me if I'm wrong. And if your 4Q price assumption did get lowered, but just in general, how do you think about price as a lever going forward? Jay, you just talked about thinking that vet visits will come back. We talk about execution and new product launches and sort of the IDEXX premium. The third pillar of the model is price. It's been obviously very elevated over the last three years. In '22, '23, '24, it looks like it's starting to normalize a little bit. Should we expect that to continue continued normalization of price over time back to that 2 to 3% historical level? Is that the right way to think about it? Brian McKeon : Yes. Mike, just to clarify some of the numbers that we shared, as you noted, we reinforced the 5% full year outlook. Some moderation in Q4. That's principally just the new business effects that we highlighted. So I think this is consistent kind of trends. We are positioned to communicate our pricing to our customers. It's not a lapping effect, is kind of the. I think that was part of your question. It's more the new business effect. And we're positioned to communicate our price increases for next year later this year with our customers. Continue to feel very good about the value that we're delivering with the focus on innovation and that we've had in the long-term as a company. And we have a new wave of innovation that we're really excited about. So I think it'll be anticipated, it'll be a positive driver for us in the near-term. In the longer term. Jay Mazelsky : Keep in mind that the way we think about pricing is to really maintain. We want to maintain. We want to be on the right side of the whole value equation. And so there's obviously new products, new innovation, but then there's products that we continue to really expand from a feature and capability standpoint. So you think about Fecal imaging and Cystoisospora and tapes and Cystatin B and VEConnect plus these were all added to the menu and panels at no additional cost. So what we strive for is to really make sure that we're adding value and price obviously reflects that. And as Brian indicated, we'll provide more guidance when we provide 2025 guidance. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The next question is from John Block with Stifel. Thanks guys. Jonathan Block : Good morning, Brian. The first one, I think there's a step down in the 24 guidance of about 150bps for total organic revenue versus the 100 bip step down for CAG the ex-recurring at the midpoint. So maybe if you can speak what that's attributable to in regards to the Delta, I'm guessing it might be fewer end use going out this year than maybe initially expected? Maybe a little bit of LPD as well. So we'd love your thoughts there. And then just to tack onto that any color on the realized ASP for in view as we start sort of scrubbing the model and the contribution into '25 and then I'll ask my follow up. Brian McKeon : Great, thanks. Thanks for your question. John. I think you hit on the themes. It's the Update includes incorporating Q3 so I think we did see somewhat softer results in areas like LPD than anticipated. So we're carrying that. I think we are capturing also the instrument revenue effects. It's principally just the strength of the in view advanced orders. I think that does have some impact in the overall order generation. So in terms of our other premium instruments, it's a good news story. Overall the EBI normalizes up very strongly and so we're really encouraged by that. And so those are kind of the factors, some tweaking on the software numbers as well just based on trends.So those are kind of the themes. The bigger driver of course is just the calibration on the CAG diagnostic recurring. Regarding your specific question on NV pricing, I think low teens has been the number we've shared and I think that's still a good estimate for the instrument price realization. It'll vary by program, but to the degree these are placed under things like 360 contracts, it's primarily upfront revenue. Jonathan Block : Okay, got it. Helpful and maybe I'll ask the follow up there.But Jay, are there any comments of was the plan always to take 700 orders and only ship 50 out? You know obviously you're beta testing this in the field. Were there any challenges that you incurred throughout that process in terms of why most of those shipments are occurring? Call it in '25, '24. That's sort of the follow up. But then the second question just on the corporate renewals, you guys don't typically talk a lot about that but admittedly corporates are a big part of the market. I don't know 30 or 40%. So just any more color that you can provide? Was that just specific to the lab number, not the in clinic? And then for the lab Brian, did we think about it like the pricing will be a headwind for the next three quarters. It took effect third quarter of '24 it's a headwind for the next three quarters, year over year and then essentially you lap the pricing benefit but continue to. I'm sorry, you lapped the pricing headwind but continue to benefit from the volume tailwind for what I'm assuming is a multiyear contract and hopefully that came across okay. Thanks guys. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, let me start with the corporates and I'll address the in-view launch and I'll turn it to Brian for some additional color on that. from a corporate standpoint, we've been very successful and these represent not just extensions but expansions. I think the corporates from a maturity standpoint are focusing more on organic growth. If you go back, they grew through clinic acquisition and there was a lot of consolidation and arbitrage. And so I think that the focus on organic growth, not just within the reference labs but using technology, whether it's point of care software and integrating those pieces, has positioned us really well and has given us an opportunity to really partner with them and help them achieve those objectives. And as I indicated in my remarks, there are certainly volume benefits that we see over time that will develop as a result of expanded business with those folks. So yeah, very excited by that. There's also, I would say from a corporate standpoint, more of an emphasis on how to implement wellness campaigns and programs. Much more harmonized way versus independent clinics as one offs. From an in view launch standpoint, we have a very tried intrude approach in terms of how we launch instrumentation. If you look at Catalyst, inVue Dx and more recently Prosci one, we start in a control fashion. We're very careful that we deliver the right customer experience. Customers expect that from us and the way we do that is we start with a smaller group of implementations and onboard those customers and tweaks as necessary. So it's really not driven by a certain number in Q4. It's really more from overall readiness so that we deliver the right experience and build over time. The receptivity to that product itself has just been outstanding and we look forward to being able to build global demand based on the menu. Very compelling menu for customers. Brian McKeon : And John, to your specific question, I hope I could follow it, but the new business effects and pricing are relatively more in labs, US labs. So that's where some of the business opportunity that we're very excited about in terms of expanding the relationships is flowing from. And I think your point was about lapping and I think you're correct. There is a, there's kind of a gross to net kind of effect in the near-term, but you work through that. Keep in mind it was three agreements that kind of built through the year. So it'll be, we'll get more clarity as we get into 2025, but basically there'll be some favorable lapping dynamics that go on the latter half of next year. To your point, you nailed it. Operator : The next question is from an Aventee with BMP Paribas. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you discuss how industry innovation in the affordability space so with vet practices offering payment plans and ADEX credit card in view and Velo could help mitigating lower visits in the near and longer term. And also can you discuss the as you are monitoring the divergence between wellness and non-wellness visits, what are you updated thoughts on the sector conditions? Thank you. Jay Mazelsky : Just maybe address the payment question first. Most of our instruments, whether it's in view or broader vet lab suites are placed through various programs and what that typically involves is there's not cash upfront and the customers make a volume, commitment over a period of time. So from a it's built in financing if you will. So there's not really, practice cash constraints on being able to, purchase new technology or instrumentation. our focus is really being able to provide technology and tools that help with capacity challenges as they exist. You know, the flip side of capacity is obviously productivity and practices are looking for ways that optimize workflow within the practice support staff productivity enable them to communicate with clients or pet owners and Velo helps us do that. Brian McKeon : And just your question on visit trends, it's interesting we tried to highlight this pain medication pain med visit effect in the numbers and as we noted that overall the -2 point visits are actually supported by about one to one and a half percent of benefit from these payment visits which show up in the non-wellness visit per the data analysis that we've done. And when you adjust for that, roughly the wellness visits would be down about 4% and non-wellness would be down about 3%. And so it's relatively more pressure on non-wellness exes pain med visits. But I would say it's indicative of a broader kind of challenge that we've had related to the macrodynamics which is visits are down overall. So I think again somewhat more in wellness which is logical given that it's relatively more discretionary but it's a broader theme. Operator : The next question is from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Erin Wright : Great, thanks. Good morning. Could you give us an update on cancer to. Yes, just the timeline magnitude that you're thinking there in terms of the rollout. And then just where should we think about in terms of. Or what should we think about in terms of price? As this is sort of a premium cancer screening wellness type of platform and any sort of early feedb on your kind of pilot testing or as you kind of talk to customers about the opportunity, particularly in the initial offering in canine lymphoma. Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, thank you. Good morning, Erin. We continue to work on really making nice progress on IDEXX cancer diagnostics with lymphoma. You know, we're still targeting a 2025 launch from both a price as well as tertiary time standpoint. We see it as a, an appropriate wellness screening, really being able to target younger but at risk dogs as well as older dogs. The feedback from key opinion leaders and oncologists has been excellent. So we continue to fully develop the product, validate the testing platforms, collect data, and are really looking forward to being able to build a market. We know that both pet owners and veterinarians see this as a major pain point today in terms of being able to detect cancer earlier than what's currently done. And when you can detect cancer earlier, obviously the therapeutic options you have are more numerous and more effective. Erin Wright : Okay, thanks. And then just on the reference lab in general, I know you touched a little bit on it before, but in terms of kind of the performance in the quarter, how we should think about the quarterly progression, any sort of changes from a competitive landscape standpoint at all, and then also just kind of your strategy, whether it's turnaround times and service levels and overnight testing and that kind of stuff, is anything changed in terms of how you're kind of contracting or working with your customers on the reference laboratory side, particularly in just kind of an inherently lower volume environment. Thanks. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. Aaron, we don't see any change in the competitive dynamic. We track that very closely. We look at net new business gains which have been positive for the quarter and for the year. We look at retention levels which remain very high in the reference labs. As Brian indicated earlier, we do see volume growth in the reference labs, the differentiation around the overall menu, Fecal antigen and the whole renal health panels and vecnect plus in the coming IDEXX cancer diagnostics, we think continues to position us really well. I think the corporate contract extensions and expansions I talked to, I spoke about really speak to the differentiation of our reference lab business. Corporates as well as independent practices want to partner with us and putting together win win partnerships is part of our strategy. Operator : The next question is from Brandon Vasquez with William Blair. Brandon Vasquez : Hey everyone, thanks for taking the question. I had two. They're both kind of related to kind of end market volumes. And so I'll maybe just ask them both upfront. The first one is, as part of your snapshot, you guys also disclose the frequency and utilization metrics. Maybe X price, if you look at that. Still a little depressed. I always tend to think of those as things that you have a little bit more control over versus the vet visit volumes. So maybe just talk about within frequency and utilization. What levers do you guys have that you can pull on as we go into 25 to help offset some of the weaker vet visit growth? And then the second follow up on vet visits is just around these pain medication headwinds that you guys are talking about. Can you clarify if this is simply, the headwind that you're talking about is simply looking at vet visit volumes, they're actually worse than they are. Or is the impact that less NSAIDs because now they're switching to injectables, means that less diagnostic tests are being done for pain medication? Thank you. Brian McKeon : So maybe I can clarify the last point and it provides a little bit of data insight on your frequency and utilization question that Jay can expand on. But what we're seeing in the data is that there are a number of visits, particularly older pets, that are related to pain medication, more recently, particularly follow up visits where the pets are being brought in and there typically isn't a diagnostic, there's an administration of the pain medication. And that is with the ramp of these pain meds, particularly over the last few quarters, that's been a pretty meaningful positive contributor to visit growth, but obviously doesn't benefit our business in terms of driving diagnostics. So what we're trying to highlight is that minus 2% on clinical visits is really for our business, minus 3% to 3.5% in terms of visits that drive diagnostics. When you turn to their frequency in the utilization side, what's interesting is adjusting for those dynamics, frequency is actually up. So for visits for pets that are coming into the clinic, we think it's positive 50 basis points rather than the minus 50 basis points we show. And it actually we see increases in utilization as well per visit, albeit at moderated paces from what we've seen historically. But it's continuing to be positive. So that's kind of the backdrop. I think there is a specific dynamic as it relates to some of the metrics that our investors focus in on and we focus in on. We think the underlying dynamics within the clinic are very healthy. It's really a visit challenge for us. But Jay can talk more about this? Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. So, the way we, from a strategic standpoint, influence both frequency and utilization is really through innovation and our commercial model. Innovation has both direct and leveraged impacts in terms of being able to drive testing, obviously within we begin shipping inVue, they'll use the cartridges and consumables and that drives utilization. But also, our programs, our marketing programs that place instruments through IDEXX360 really inspire use of the reference labs and rapid assay and our software businesses. So it's, we think that over time, and we've shown this over time that historically where do you bring innovations that solve the most challenging, both clinical and business problems that, customers end up, veterinarians end up using diagnostics because it's really foundational in terms of driving the medical services and care management approaches within their clinics. Operator : The next question is from David Westenberg with Piper Sandler. David Westenberg : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So I'm going to unpack a couple of that on the reference lab and then on the pain drug visits. And ultimately what I'm trying to get to is potential utilization acceleration probably next year or maybe the year after. But the differential between consumables and reference lab, we haven't seen that big of a gap since 2018. Is there a way maybe veterinary groups are thinking about changing the way they're thinking about diagnostics, perhaps using inside lab more as a strategy to generate more diagnostics. And again, I'm only saying that because we're seeing the biggest gap that we've seen. You've explained some of that stuff, including days and then also on the pain drug. In fact, we've seen Cytopoint. It's been around since 2016. It's been about half as much of an impact on visits, but it's still been an impact on visits. Now elderly patients are more likely to be sold the diagnostics. So you would think that, maybe there's a, as you see this captive audience, I mean, when we talk to veterinary customers, they love this captive audience. So is there maybe a longer tail impact to increase diagnostics? Because now you have the elderly patient. And again, I'm trying to focus this question on utilization of diagnostics. Maybe next year as we build on some of these trends. Thank you. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. So good morning, David. Let me just talk about the in clinic versus the reference lab model, we don't see actually a modality shift. I think a number of things influence that. Obviously wellness visits, as I called out, is primarily a reference lab send out modality. But just in terms of overall use, it's based on situational conditions with the pet. If the pet comes in and is non well or an acute condition, veterinarians tend to do the in clinic testing so they get to interpretation quickly. In other cases, if it's a specialty test, they'll send that out. But we haven't seen, we actually haven't seen a mix shift above and beyond the wellness visit trend that may be impacted by overall macro considerations. In terms of the pain medication piece, the point that I would highlight is we haven't seen for those patients coming in to the practice that are getting let's say pain medication primarily, let's focus on dogs, primarily older dogs. And we haven't seen any impact on the use of diagnostics. So we don't think there's a substitution, effect or potentially even driving more diagnostics in those cases, if that's what you were getting at. Brian McKeon : And Dave, just to your question on utilization and utilization drivers over time, I know you're familiar with this, but we've highlighted frequently in our longer-term strategic discussions the metric of bloodwork inclusion in diagnostics and that for a very long period of time had accelerated at 50 basis points. We saw that going into the pandemic actually accelerated through the pandemic. And what we see more recently in this transition post pandemic period with some of the macro headwinds is it's sustaining, it's just not growing at the 50 basis points. That's a 200-basis point growth upside. If we can get back to the 50 basis point expansion for our US business and 150 basis points globally that was highlighted in our investor day discussion. So we're encouraged that it's sustaining so well with some of the macro dynamics going on and building off of the accelerated growth that we saw there in pandemic. And we feel very confident in our ability to influence that over time as we've done for decades and see that as central to our long-term growth strategy. Jay Mazelsky : So I'll now conclude the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you for your participation this morning. It's once again my pleasure to share how I'd executed against our organic growth strategy. While delivering excellent financial results in the third quarter, companion animal diagnostics sector remains an attractive space supported by long-term global secular growth drivers and a significant opportunity to enhance standards of care. IDEXX's current innovation cycle and effective customer engagement playbook have positioned us well to lead the penetration of this opportunity, and I look forward to sharing more updates with you on our solid progress. And so with that, we'll conclude the call. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

In reviewing our fourth quarter 2024 results and initial 2025 guidance, please note all references to growth, organic growth and comparable growth refer to growth compared to the equivalent prior-year period, unless otherwise noted. To allow broad participation in the Q&A, we ask that each participant limit their questions to one with one follow-up as necessary. We appreciate you may have additional questions, so please feel free to get back into the queue, and if time permits, we'll take your additional questions. Today's prepared remarks will be posted to the Investor Relations section of our website after the earnings conference call concludes. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian McKeon. Brian McKeon : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Today, I'm pleased to review our Q4 and full year 2024 financial results. Andrew Emerson, who will be assuming responsibility as IDEXX's CFO on March 1st, will take you through the details of the company's outlook for 2025. IDEXX had a solid finish to 2024, reflected in fourth quarter performance ahead of our expectations. Revenue increased 6% organically, supported by 7% organic gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues. Operating profits increased 7% as reported and 8% on a comparable basis, benefiting from solid gross margin gains, which supported operating margin performance at the high end of our guidance range. We also saw positive impacts from increased stock-based compensation activity, which benefited our effective tax rate. These factors supported delivery of $2.62 in EPS in Q4, up 10% on a comparable basis. IDEXX execution drove solid expansion of our business for the full year 2024. This is reflected in 7% full year organic growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, 9% growth in our global premium instrument installed base, 11% organic gains in recurring software and digital imaging revenues, and 11% organic growth in our Water business. We delivered excellent full year financial performance in 2024, supported by comparable operating margin gains at the high-end of our long-term annual improvement goals. Full year EPS of $10.67 per share, which includes $0.56 per share of negative impact related to a discrete litigation expense accrual, increased 12% on a comparable basis, including 2% of negative growth impact from the lapping of a 2023 customer contract resolution payment. These results were achieved as we successfully advanced our innovation-driven growth strategy and worked through greater-than-expected sector and macro headwinds. As Andrew will discuss, this performance sets a solid foundation for our business to build upon as we enter 2025. Let's begin with a review of our 2024 results. Fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 6% reflected solid gains across IDEXX's major business segments, including: 6% organic growth in CAG; 7% organic gains in LPD; and 9% organic growth in Water. Worldwide CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue increased 7% organically in Q4, including benefits from improved volume growth trends. Results were supported by average global net price improvement of 4 % to 4.5%, with US net price realization of approximately 3.5%. As noted in our last earnings call, US net price realization includes impacts from the successful extension and expansion of three major customer agreements in 2024, which will provide long-term incremental volume growth benefits for IDEXX. US CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue increased 4% organically in Q4, net of a 1% negative growth impact from fewer equivalent selling days. IDEXX execution drove approximately 2% US volume growth in the quarter, normalized for equivalent days. These results were supported by sustained solid new business gains, high customer retention levels, and relatively higher gains in diagnostic frequency and volume utilization per clinical visit. IDEXX achieved a solid 800 basis point normalized growth premium compared to US clinical visit growth levels in the fourth quarter. We continue to work through pressure on US same-store clinical visit levels, which declined nearly 3% in Q4 and 2% for the full year in 2024. This has been the primary constraint on IDEXX's recent growth, reflecting transitional sector macro impacts following the accelerated expansion of pet healthcare during the pandemic. International CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth was 12% in Q4, including a 1% benefit from equivalent days effects. Strong Q4 international results benefited from net price gains and improved volume growth, supported by new business expansion, reflected in double-digit year-on-year growth in our international premium instrument installed base. IDEXX fourth quarter performance was supported by strong global growth in consumable revenues. IDEXX VetLab consumable revenues increased 12% organically, reflecting double-digit gains in US and international regions, normalized for equivalent days effects. Consumable gains were supported by a 9% increase in our global premium instrument installed base in 2024, reflecting solid gains across our Catalyst, Premium Hematology and SediVue platforms. For the full year 2024, we achieved approximately 18,500 premium instrument placements with excellent quality, reflected in sustained, high, new and competitive Catalyst placements. In the fourth quarter, we placed 4,625 premium instruments, down 12% from high prior-year levels. Overall CAG instrument revenues also declined 12% organically in Q4. Quarterly placement results were supported by strong gains in SediVue and continued expansion of ProCyte One. We also initiated shipments of IDEXX inVue Dx in the quarter, supporting strong comparable EVI gains, including the projected value of inVue preorders. Rapid assay revenue was flat on an organic basis in Q4. Rapid assay results were constrained by pressure on US wellness visits as well as by the addition of the pancreatic lipase slide to our Catalyst menu, which we estimated to be a 4% headwind to Q4 revenue growth. Global lab revenues expanded 4% organically in Q4. Reference lab results in the quarter were supported by solid normalized volume growth in US and international regions, and net price gains. Reference lab net price gains were moderated in Q4 by near-term impacts from major new customer agreements, which will benefit long-term reference lab growth. CAG veterinary software services and diagnostic imaging revenues increased 7% organically in Q4 compared to strong prior-year levels. Results continue to be supported by solid growth in recurring revenues and ongoing momentum in cloud-based software placements. In other business segments, Water revenues increased 9% organically in Q4 compared to strong prior year levels, driven by continued solid gains in the US and Europe. Livestock, Poultry and Dairy revenues increased 7% organically in Q4, supported by solid gains in our US, Europe and Latin American regions. Turning to the P&L, Q4 operating profits increased 7% as reported and 8% on a comparable basis, supported by gross margin gains. Gross profit increased 8% as reported and 9% on a comparable basis. Gross margins were 59.8%, up 130 basis points on a comparable basis, adjusting for approximately 10 basis points of positive FX impact. Gross margin gains reflected favorable business mix supported by strong consumable growth, benefits from net price improvement, and higher Water gross margins. Operating expenses were up 10% as reported, and 9% on a comparable basis in the quarter, reflecting increases in R&D spending, aligned with advancing our innovation initiatives, including our new instrument platforms. For the full year 2024, operating margins were 29%, an increase of 60 basis points on a comparable basis, including an approximately 40 basis point negative impact from lapping a customer contract resolution payment in 2023. Full year operating margins included 160 basis points of negative impact related to a discrete litigation expense accrual recorded in the second quarter. Q4 EPS was $2.62 per share, up 10% on a comparable basis. In Q4, EPS benefited from a lower effective tax rate, including $0.13 per share in tax benefits from share-based compensation activity and $0.06 per share benefit from a non-recurring tax reserve release related to the lapping of an applicable statute of limitations. Foreign exchange drove a $0.03 per share EPS headwind in the quarter, net of approximately $3 million in hedge gains. Full year EPS was $10.67 per share, an increase of 6% on a reported basis and 12% on a comparable basis, including a 2% negative EPS growth impact related to lapping a customer contract resolution payment. 2024 full year EPS results include $0.56 of negative impact from a discrete expense accrual related to an ongoing litigation matter, $0.05 of negative impact from currency changes, and $0.24 in tax benefits from share-based compensation activity. Foreign exchange had limited impact on Q4 and full year revenue growth. For the full year, foreign exchange reduced operating profits by $5 million and EPS by $0.05 per share, net of $6 million in hedge gains. Free cash flow was $808 million for 2024 or 91% of net income, aligned with our guidance and long-term goals. Capital spending was $121 million for the full year or approximately 3% of revenue. We allocated $249 million to repurchase 564,000 shares in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we allocated $859 million to repurchase 1,760,000 shares. Our balance sheet is in a strong position. We ended 2024 with leverage ratios of 0.7 times gross and 0.4 times net of cash. That concludes our financial review. Andrew will now walk you through our initial 2025 financial outlook. Andrew Emerson : Thank you, Brian. Turning to our 2025 full year outlook, IDEXX is planning to deliver solid organic revenue growth and profit gains, led by strong execution and benefits from new innovation. We're providing initial guidance for revenue of $4.055 billion to $4.170 billion, an increase of 4% to 7% on a reported basis. On an organic basis, this reflects a growth range of 6% to 9% overall, supported by 5% to 8% organic growth in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues. At current exchange rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 2% negative impact on full year revenue growth. In terms of key drivers for our 2025 organic growth outlook, the midpoint of our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth range incorporates expectations for global net price realization of 4% to 4.5% and volume gains of approximately 2%. The outlook includes assumptions for declines in US same-store clinical visit growth levels with the midpoint reflecting a similar rate of a decline seen in 2024. These targets incorporate continued, solid global growth benefits from IDEXX execution drivers, including new customer gains and increases in testing utilization, supported by IDEXX innovations. The higher end of our CAG Diagnostic recurring revenue growth outlook captures the potential for improved sector visit and same-store growth trends, while the lower end of the range calibrates for further potential effects of macroeconomic conditions. Our revenue growth outlook includes approximately $50 million of projected IDEXX inVue Dx instrument revenue aligned with 4,500 placements. Jay will discuss progress against our inVue Dx launch in his comments. Our reported operating margin outlook for the full year 2025 is 31% to 31.5%. On a comparable basis, this reflects an outlook of 30 basis points to 80 basis points of improvement year-over-year, net of a 160 basis point operating margin benefit related to the lapping of the discrete litigation expense recorded in the second quarter of 2024. We're planning for solid gross margin gains on a comparable basis in 2025, supported by growth in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenues, benefits from lab productivity initiatives, and expansion of our high-margin cloud-based software business. This is partially offset by unfavorable business mix planned from higher levels of CAG Diagnostics instrument revenue gains and preliminary estimates for tariff risk on internationally-sourced materials. Our 2025 EPS outlook is $11.74 per share to $12.24 per share. This reflects an increase of 8% to 12% on a comparable basis, net of a 6% EPS growth benefit from the lapping of the Q2 2024 discrete litigation expense, and includes a $0.06 per share headwind from higher taxes related to a non-recurring tax reserve release during the fourth quarter of 2024. Our EPS outlook also includes $42 million of net interest expense at prevailing rates. Foreign exchange is expected to have a negative impact of $0.21 year-over-year at the rates disclosed in our press release, net of established hedge positions. In terms of sensitivities to changes in foreign exchange rates, we project a 1% change in the value of the US dollar would impact the full year reported revenue by $15 million and operating income by $5 million, net of hedge positions. Our 2025 free cash flow outlook is for net income to free cash flow conversion ratio of 85% to 90%, aligned with our long-term goals. This reflects estimated capital spending of approximately $160 million or about 4% of revenues. The outlook incorporates increased capital deployment, aligned with $1.5 billion towards share repurchases or approximately 4% of our current equity market capitalization. This reflects our high confidence in IDEXX growth potential, including continued strong execution and advancement of our innovation agenda. Regarding our Q1 outlook, we're planning for overall organic revenue growth of 4% to 6%, with similar gains in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue net of a 1% to 1.5% days headwind. This factors in US clinic visit trends more aligned with Q4 2024 and pricing benefits at the low-end of our full year price realization range as we work through the major customer agreements noted by Brian. Reported revenue growth of 2% to 4% includes approximately 2% negative impact from foreign exchange at current rates. Our Q1 reported operating margins are planned for 30.2% to 30.6%. This reflects moderate compression in comparable margins in the quarter compared to high prior-year levels and reflects investments to support recent and upcoming product launches. Overall, we're well-positioned to build on our solid 2024 financial performance with continued strong execution and robust set of new product launches during 2025. This concludes our guidance update, and I will now turn the call over to Jay for his comments. Jay Mazelsky : Good morning, and thank you, Andrew. IDEXX delivered another strong quarter to close out 2024, capped with the initial placements of IDEXX inVue Dx. Our results this quarter exemplified the resilience of our business model, built on the foundation of customer-centric innovation, high-touch commercial execution, and a steadfast commitment to growth, by advancing the standard of care in veterinary medicine. This year, we celebrated significant milestones, including the highly-anticipated launch of IDEXX inVue Dx, a groundbreaking cellular analyzer redefining slide-free Point-of-Care testing. We recently announced the launch of IDEXX Cancer Dx with canine lymphoma, a transformative oncology screening and aid-in-diagnosis panel that will expand over time to address the most common canine cancer. We're also concurrently commercializing three new products and services as part of our Catalyst technology-for-life platform in test menu and enabling software. Introductions include : Pancreatic Lipase Testing, a single-slide solution already embraced by thousands of clinics; SmartQC, which enables very easy monthly calibration on our chemistry platform; and an updated IDEXX VetLab Station with a more modern, intuitive interface supporting workflow efficiencies. IDEXX commercial teams continue to operate at a high-level this year, supporting new business gains, solid net price realization, high-90%s customer retention levels across major testing modalities, and sustained adoption levels of diagnostic testing utilization near post-pandemic highs. High placement levels across our core premium instrument platforms drove a 9% growth in our premium instrument installed base. The team also delivered very strong year-on-year EVI gains when incorporating benefits from nearly 1,600 global pre-orders for IDEXX inVue Dx, which will benefit our business over the coming year. 2024 also saw the extension and expansion of three major customer agreements, which will provide solid volume gains for our reference lab business. These important contractual renewals highlight the value IDEXX solutions bring to our customers, supporting their practice revenue growth through highly important diagnostic testing categories. 2024 was also a pivotal year for our software business. With double-digit growth in our cloud-native PIMS placements, and the launch of our pet owner engagement solution Vello, we are helping clinics bridge the gap between patient care and operational efficiency. Vello, now adopted by nearly 600 practices, has enhanced pet-owner engagement by streamlining communication and driving increased clinical visits and diagnostic frequency. These advancements highlight the expanding role of software in unlocking the full potential of diagnostics while delivering a seamless experience for veterinarians and pet owners alike. This strong execution was delivered in a dynamic macro-economic and sector environment, which saw continued pressure on clinical visits. For pets visiting US clinics, pet owners continue to demonstrate interest in a higher standard of care, reflecting the strength of the pet-owner bond and the prioritization of pet health. Diagnostics play a key central role in enabling better medical outcomes, as nearly half of clinical visits include some form of diagnostic testing. The growth in the use of blood work in preventive screening, highlights the value pet parents place on proactive care, driven by advancements in technology and awareness of health benefits. Our commercial strategy is to support this positive trend through the use of preventive care marketing programs like Simple Start, and testing innovations such as IDEXX Cancer Dx, which will be included at attractive prices to inspire pull-through. IDEXX's commercial execution continues to be a cornerstone of our success, reflecting the deep expertise, commitment and customer-focus of our teams around the globe. Our partnership approach has yielded exceptional customer retention rates of over 97%, ensuring that practices continue to see IDEXX as an indispensable partner in their growth and efficiency goals. Customers trust IDEXX to help them navigate challenges of staffing and visit trends. Our nearly double-digit premium instrument installed base growth, is driven by robust new placements across chemistry, hematology, and SediVue platforms, as well as the first placements of IDEXX inVue Dx. We also continue to make strong progress in placing our IDEXX VetLab suites in competitive and greenfield accounts, a focus area since we get the full growth benefit of consumables usage. Customers are hungry for Point-of-Care technology that supports their medical mission with fast, real-time results, while minimizing workflow bottlenecks with innovations such as load-and-go capability, a common easy-to-use interface, and instrument uptime measured in years. An additional benefit is that our large, rapidly growing installed base of over 74,000 chemistry analyzers, for example, allow for rapid global adoption of new testing innovations such as Pancreatic Lipase, the tenth such menu extension in a bit over 12 years. Menu extensions such as Pancreatic Lipase help support a healthy volume premium to the clinic visit baseline. Our international regions showcased strong performance in 2024, contributing significantly to our growth story. Double-digit expansion of our premium instrument installed base outside the US underscored the benefits of our targeted global commercial investments over the past three years. Our maturing international sales organization has not only secured high-quality placements but also driven consistent diagnostic utilization gains, particularly in the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions, where we continue to see untapped potential. Spotlighting our European region's very strong performance, we saw the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue growth, with IDEXX VetLab consumables growth in the high-teens. Customer satisfaction remains at the heart of our commercial strategy, supported by sustained sector-leading levels of engagement and trust. IDEXX's investment in areas such as VetConnect PLUS feature expansion that now gives the customer the ability to access reference lab sample turnaround time and order status information. This is part of our strategy to not only provide subject matter expertise and complimentary testing support through our medical consulting organization but workflow optimization that help clinics navigate the complexities of modern veterinary care. This focus on customer success not only drives loyalty, but also ensures that IDEXX remains the go-to partner for diagnostic solutions. The launch of IDEXX inVue Dx has been one of the most exciting developments in 2024, marking a new era in Point-of-Care diagnostics. Designed as a technology-for-life platform, inVue Dx combines advanced optics, artificial intelligence, and a slide-free workflow to deliver transformative diagnostic insights with unparalleled ease of use. The initial menu focuses on ear cytology and blood morphology taps into two clinically well understood, high volume use cases that benefit from automation and a step up in testing consistency and performance. Customer interest for IDEXX inVue Dx continues to be exceptionally strong, with nearly 1,600 preorders globally by the end of Q4, reflecting the high demand for this next-generation platform. International interest has been similarly robust as we began taking orders in select geographies in Q4; though like the US, we have placed some limits on the number of preorders our account managers take. This level of enthusiasm underscores the transformative potential of inVue Dx in clinics worldwide. As I mentioned previously, we initiated a controlled launch of IDEXX inVue Dx in Q4 and, to ensure a best-in-class customer experience, we will gradually ramp up placements through 2025. Early feedback from customers, both in the customer experience trials and for the initial placements, has been exceptionally positive. Customers are simply amazed with how easy the analyzer is to use, eliminating the need for complex slide preparation or interpretation, with results in minutes. Underpinning the financial guidance Andrew shared is a placement target for 4,500-plus inVue placements over the course of the year, as we march towards our 20,000 placement goal over five years. IDEXX operations and supply chain teams have made outstanding progress ramping manufacturing to support this level of placements while our field service representative team has been expanded and trained to provide critical installation capacity to support both the inVue ramp and continued growth of our core instrument platforms. The moment is upon us to bring this transformative analyzer to our global customer base. Looking ahead, we remain on track to expand IDEXX inVue Dx's capabilities further with the addition of Fine Needle Aspirate, or FNA, testing for lumps and bumps later in 2025, unlocking significant opportunity in oncology diagnostics. We are excited to have announced at VMX, the March launch of IDEXX Cancer Dx panel with Lymphoma, a pioneering advancement in veterinary oncology. This innovative screening solution represents a significant step forward in companion animal healthcare, addressing a critical need for early cancer detection and as an aid-in-diagnosis in canine patients. The IDEXX Cancer Dx panel has breakthrough cost, performance, and turn-around-time attributes for early-stage cancer diagnostic screening and as an aid-in-diagnosis test, priced for as little as $15 per test when included as part of select diagnostic panels. This will change how and when canine cancer is detected, and its early diagnosis will likely change how cancer care is managed, with positive patient implications for the support of longer, healthier lives. Given the performance, cost and turn-around-time attributes of the Cancer Dx panel, the opportunity is to inspire a much broader inclusion of cancer screening as an essential part of preventive care blood work. The Cancer Dx panel will initially launch with lymphoma detection, one of the most common and treatable cancers in dogs. Over the next three years, the panel will expand to include the six most prevalent canine cancers, which collectively account for over 50% of cancer cases in dogs. This expanded menu will tap into an estimated $1.1 billion addressable opportunity, underscoring the potential of this diagnostic innovation. Our software ecosystem plays a pivotal role in supporting veterinarians by enhancing clinic efficiency, optimizing workflows, and fostering deeper connections with practices and pet owners. With double-digit growth in cloud-native placements, software remains a critical enabler of diagnostic adoption and practice success, reinforcing our position as a leader in vertical SaaS offerings tailored to veterinary needs. One of the year's standout achievements was the expansion of Vello, our pet-owner engagement application. Designed to address the growing demand for seamless communication and improved visit outcomes, Vello has been embraced by nearly 600 practices at year-end, doubling its user base since Q3. Early results from the app's deployment have been highly encouraging, with participating clinics reporting increased clinical visits, higher diagnostic usage and improved revenue. This underscores Vello's ability to address critical workflow pain points while fostering stronger relationships between veterinarians and pet owners. We have meaningfully increased development resources and investment in Vello throughout 2024 and now in 2025. Looking ahead, Vello's development roadmap promises even greater value with upcoming enhancements focused on streamlining communications, expanding engagement tools, including the ability to personalize messaging, and integrating advanced analytics. Customers appreciate our commitment to an integrated diagnostics and software suite and the way it unlocks new opportunity for growth. Beyond Vello, we continued to expand our broader software portfolio. We placed a record number of cloud-native PIMS, expanding that installed base by 20% year-over-year, as our offerings remain a top choice for clinics seeking modern, scalable solutions. We finished the year with 60% of our PIMS installed base in the cloud, ahead of our estimate shared at Investor Day in August. IDEXX Web PACS, our cloud-native imaging workflow engine, also experienced double-digit subscriber growth, demonstrating its relevance in addressing key pain points such as dental imaging workflows. These advancements not only simplify complex processes but also allow clinicians to spend more time focusing on patient care. The integration of diagnostics and software remains a cornerstone of IDEXX's value proposition. By providing intuitive, efficient, and comprehensive tools, we empower clinics to unlock new levels of performance while delivering superior care to their patients. As we move into 2025, our focus on software innovation will continue to drive recurring revenue growth and deepen our partnerships with veterinary practices worldwide. As we turn the page on 2024, IDEXX remains steadfast in its purpose : to create exceptional long-term value for our customers, employees and shareholders by enhancing the health and well-being of pets, people and livestock. I extend my deepest gratitude to our nearly 11,000 employees whose dedication and hard work have made these accomplishments possible. Together, we have delivered robust financial results while setting the stage for a promising 2025 and beyond, supported by a new wave of IDEXX innovations. I'd like to thank Brian McKeon for the exceptional contributions he has made over a 20-year IDEXX career, spanning both as a member of our Board, and over the last 11 years, as IDEXX's CFO. As previously announced, Brian will be stepping down from the role as CFO as of March 1st. One of Brian's many contributions has been to build a world-class finance team and develop future leadership talent. It's my great pleasure to welcome Andrew Emerson, who will become our new CFO as of March 1st. Andrew brings more than 20 years of finance experience in the healthcare industry in roles of increasing responsibility, including over nine years at IDEXX working side-by-side with Brian throughout this time. He is well versed in our business, our sector and our strategy, and he is set to contribute on day one. Brian will remain with IDEXX in a senior advisory capacity until his retirement date of June 1st in order to help ensure a smooth and seamless transition for Andrew. With that, I will turn it back over for Q&A. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Erin Wright : Great, thanks. And Brian, it's been great working with you over the years, and congrats on your retirement. And looking forward to working with you, too, Andrew, as we, kind of, move forward. But, in terms of my questions, I'll start with innovation. So, I guess, can you speak to what guidance assumes now in terms of the innovation contribution in 2025? Is that adding about 1 point to CAG recurring growth assumptions for you? And I just wanted to get an update on inVue on that front. I guess, why are you limiting preorders in the US and the replacements, I guess, of 10, but preorders of 1,600, so I guess why is there such a backlog there? Is there more AI training needed? Is there necessary adjustments to the offering or timing of the rollout or anything like that, or practitioners just waiting for FNA? I guess, when do you expect FNA to launch as well, and what is guidance assumed on that front? Thanks. Andrew Emerson : Good morning, Erin. This is Andrew. Happy to kick us off with what's included in the guidance and then I'll hand it over to Jay to talk a bit about inVue. Just in terms of what we've provided, we initially get the benefits from the instrument revenues as we launch a platform like inVue. What we noted in the prepared remarks is approximately $50 million and 4,500 placements on the innovation launch of the inVue Dx platform. So, we feel good about that. That's captured in our overall guidance. We haven't necessarily broken out the other innovation areas, but we do expect benefits from PL and Cancer, as Jay highlighted in his remarks. They're going to allow us to continue to build momentum, both domestically and internationally, but we haven't broken those out. We just have included that, and we feel good about the guidance that we've provided at this point. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. So, I'll take it from there. Good morning, Erin. So, as disclosed, we began shipping in Q4. I'd say that customer interest has been very high, and that's reflected in close to the 1,600 preorders that I indicated. From a customer lens, what customers are responding to is -- are some of the things that we've been talking about, the key attributes of the system, starting with the menu, ear cytology and blood morphology and then FNA later in 2025. The way customers see these clinical use cases, very high volume, well understood, and well-integrated into the workflow of how they practice. They also like the slide-free operation. They see preparing slides as really an intensive bottleneck, sometimes 15 minutes, 20 minutes. And of course, at the end of the day, what they want is consistent, highly accurate results, and they see inVue as being able to deliver that. In terms of the actual launch and approach, we follow a very tried and true controlled launch process for all our analyzers. In fact, this is my fourth premium instrument launch since being at IDEXX, and it starts with the aim of delivering an exceptional customer experience. It's what they expect of us. They know we have a world-class product development organization. There's always tweaks that come up as part of any launch. What I would say is, we're making excellent progress. We plan to deliver the 4,500-plus in 2025, as I indicated, and that will ramp over the year. Manufacturing and installation capacity are ahead of plan, and that puts us in a strong position to achieve the plan and customers aren't waiting -- to answer to your specific question around, are they waiting for FNA to pick delivery, they're not. Erin Wright : Okay, great. That's helpful. And then, does your guidance assume any sort of notable changes from a customer account standpoint at Point-of-Care or ref lab? I just -- presumably you're still lapping through some of that repricing action taken, I guess, in 2024. I guess, can you remind us, when you fully lap that? And can you help us quantify how that headwind lingers into 2025? Is it an incremental headwind net-net or less of a headwind in 2025? Thanks. Andrew Emerson : Thanks, Erin. So, just on pricing, what we noted was 4% to 4.5% for the full year. In Q1 specifically, we did a remark that we would expect to be on the lower end of that range, just given the three large customer lapping that Brian had captured in his commentary on our Q4 results. So, we will continue to lap that throughout the year, but I think we've captured that in our guidance. And again, we feel good that we have strong momentum in terms of our ability to continue to work with our customers and expand our installed base, both internationally where we saw double-digit growth as well as globally where we had a 9% installed base expansion for 2024. Erin Wright : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much for the questions. Just two on the 2025 guidance. First, can you just elaborate on the vet visit trajectory you expect from here? It sounds like, I think from the prepared remarks, down 3% or so in 1Q, but can you just talk about the recovery and confidence in recovery from there? And the second question was just on US versus ex-US growth this year. Any notable kind of differences or trends that you're expecting as we think about the regions? Thank you. Andrew Emerson : Good morning, Chris. So, just to talk about the vet visits, in terms of what we've included in the guide for the US, we signaled it was similar to the decline that we intended for 2024. So that would represent approximately 2%, as Brian highlighted. When we think about Q1, we are anticipating that we saw similar trends as we exited the year. Q4 was about a 3% decline on clinical visits overall. And just as we saw in Q4, we saw some modest differences by quarter, but ultimately, again, we're anticipating about a 2% decline in clinical visits for 2025. So, not really an improvement as we head into the year and that could bounce around a little bit by quarter and we'll provide more information as the year goes on. Jay Mazelsky : Good morning, Chris. Maybe just to spotlight our international performance. We've, as you know, invested fairly heavily in expanding our international commercial footprint over the last three-plus years. And we've seen really nice growth in terms of overall installed base of our premium instruments and associated consumable stream. In Europe, in fact, we've seen last seven quarters of double-digit growth, and from a consumable standpoint, in the high-teens. And I think that's just a reflection of really strong execution, longer tenure in [seat] (ph) and customer response to innovations like ProCyte One and other solutions that help them practice good medicine. Chris Schott : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question is from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Michael Ryskin : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I have a couple of quick ones, hopefully, guys. The first on the -- just going back to the visit dynamics, you talked through your assumptions for 2025. I just want to dig into 4Q a little bit. I know we probably shouldn't look into quarter-to-quarter trends and these things are volatile. I understand all that. But just the dispersion here between wellness and non-wellness, is what really struck me. It seems like it sort of accelerated through the course of '24 and sort of reached its broadest dispersion in the fourth quarter. You really saw wellness drop off pretty sharply relative to total clinical visits or non-wellness visits. Just wondering what you're seeing on the ground, what the feedback is you're getting at? Obviously, there's a lot of concern that that's driven by demand, elasticity, price, weak consumer environment, people just sort of backing away from some of those more discretionary visits. I know you've talked in prior quarters about potentially the impact on visit trends from some therapeutic options and turning -- including injectable drugs. Just any color you can provide on wellness specifically and why you've seen that deteriorate over the course of 2024? Jay Mazelsky : Sure. Let me provide some insight on that, Mike. We do think at the margin, there was probably the impacts from the consumer and the overall macro environment, but the interesting thing about wellness is the inclusion of diagnostics actually went up. So, we saw a really nice premium growth. Our belief is that the quality of these visits went up. The pet owner in veterinarian really used that higher intensity of diagnostics. So, though there's probably some marginal pet owners dropping off potentially deferring or delaying some of those visits, the ones that came in, very high quality, and we benefited from that, and we think with our IDEXX Cancer Diagnostics panel included in wellness visits, we'll continue to inspire potentially pull-through on that end, too. Michael Ryskin : Okay. All right. And then, for my follow-up question, I don't think you really called this out in the prepared remarks, but I noticed that for the guide for 2025, Brian or Andrew, you guys are assuming a little bit more share buyback. I think you said 2% to 3% reduction in shares. I think you've -- most years, you've sort of been in that 1% reduction. Just any additional color there in terms of the rationale for that? Thanks. Andrew Emerson : Yeah, Mike. So, just in terms of kind of a rationale, we have high confidence in the company's potential growth model here. We've executed exceptionally well, and I think we're really on the cusp of that new wave of innovation, which Jay has highlighted several times. This really reflects strong free cash flow generation. We have a really healthy balance sheet with high liquidity. Brian mentioned on the call in terms of Q4, our gross leverage was about 0.7 times, and this largely sustains those levels at a higher deployment rate. So, it does achieve that 2% to 3% reduction in average shares. And again, we look at this as a positive momentum for the long-term. Michael Ryskin : All right. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Jon Block with Stifel. Jon Block : Thanks, guys. Good morning. It looks like the IDEXX premium for the quarter, so in other words, 4Q '24 was the strongest of the year and that was before the rollout of Cancer Dx, I mean, essentially before inVue for the most part. So, can you just talk about what led to the uptick for the premium in the quarter, allowed you to arguably offset the down whatever was 2.9% in clinical and still put up some pretty good CAG Dx recurring? That's specific to the fourth quarter '24 question. Then, I'll ask a follow-up. Brian McKeon : Hey, Jon, it's Brian. As you pointed out, it was a very good quarter, our best volume growth quarter of the year when you normalize for days. We saw very strong consumable growth. I think that that's reflective of the progress that we've made on instrument placements, growing the installed base during the year. Some benefit from innovation, the pancreatic lipase slide is helpful on that front, and globally, just really good international momentum. So, I think, it's reflective of the strong execution that we've seen throughout the year that's enabled us to grow at a faster rate than the sector. And as the team has pointed out, I think the company is really well positioned to build on that heading into 2025 with the new innovations that will be coming. Jon Block : Got it. Helpful. And then maybe second question on price. So, I think it's -- I think you called it 3.5% in the US. It sort of implies, I don't know, 5%-and-change in the international markets. Jay, can you just talk about your comfort in these pricing levels that the consumer can absorb the likely increases? I think you're going to say we don't dictate price to the consumer, but you sort of do because the vet's not going to take it all on the margin -- on their margin. And to Mike's previous question, do you think this higher pricing environment while providing a temporary fix is acting as a headwind as we continue to see this wellness slide and hence the pet owner avoid wanting to come in for that wellness sticker shock? And then, part B of a very disparate question is, the $42 million in interest expense, can you just reconcile that? It just looks pretty high considering where we were in '24. Thanks, guys. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah, let me talk about pricing and I'll turn it to Andrew to talk about the interest expense. Of course, I'm going to caveat it and say our customers determine in sector pricing. Keep in mind, wellness versus non-wellness pricing are different things. Typically for a wellness visit, the veterinarian doesn't spend more than five, seven, 10 minutes with the pet owner. So, they price it differently, and we offer a number of programs like compliance-based pricing, which I think is positions it positions those panels very advantageously. I would say that we are very mindful of the need to be in front of the differentiation that we offer through innovations. A lot of what we offer, for example, is complementary to the customer, whether it's VetConnect PLUS, whether we add in tapes and Cystoisospora for fecal antigen. I think Cancer Dx is a great example of really keeping that price very moderate at $15-plus per select panels. So overall, we're comfortable in terms of where we've priced. We've seen an increase, as I just indicated, in the inclusion of diagnostics and wellness panels, in fact, very strong increase in Q4. So, the quality of the visits and the quality of diagnostics inclusion has been growing fairly strongly. Andrew, do you want to address the... Andrew Emerson : Yeah. Jon, just in terms of the $42 million on interest, that does align with the step up in terms of our planned buybacks of $1.5 billion. So, again, we've calibrated that based off of current rates. As Brian noted, we did just about $850 million in 2024. So, there's an increased level there and we've captured that in our interest expense cost. Operator : The next question is from Daniel Clark with Leerink Partners. Daniel Clark : Yes. Thank you. I just had a quick clarification on inVue. Are you still limiting preorders or are you fully allowing those now? Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. So, we -- generally, we've opened the funnel in terms of what our field organizations can take in North America. I would say internationally, it's more limited and we'll continue to just offer it in select countries. And throughout the year, we'll revisit that. Daniel Clark : Okay, got it. Thank you. And then just a separate question, was there any impact from weather that's worth calling out in terms of visit trends for 4Q or how you're thinking about 1Q? Thanks. Andrew Emerson : Good morning, Dan. So, just in the fourth quarter, I think we had signaled on the last call that we anticipated about 50 basis points of weather associated with what we saw in early October. Yes, as we head into Q1, certainly, we've seen some weather types of impacts, but at the end of the day, we've captured those in our outlook and again feel good about the guide that we presented today. Operator : The next question is from Navann Ty with BNP Paribas Exane. Navann Ty : Hi, good morning. First on the vet visit, if you can discuss further the underlying factors embedded in the 2% decline, expected midpoint in terms of macro impact and time to replenish vet and vet techs graduate? And do you expect potential improvement in 2026? And then, in terms of margin, should we still expect 2025 margin expansion to be still gross margin-led? And can you discuss the SG&A and R&D this year with the inVue and Cancer Diagnostics launches and expansions? Thank you. Jay Mazelsky : Yeah. Just to provide some -- I'll cover the clinical visit trends. Just to provide some additional color on that, we still think capacity constraints are a challenge for practices less around just absolute employment levels and maybe more related to number of hours worked. In talking to number of the corporate or enterprise accounts, they continue to speak to the desire to hire more veterinarians and staff as they become available. And in that sense, supply can drive demand. Probably the more primary factor is macroeconomic environment, cumulative impacts of inflation and some moderation as a result of that. Andrew Emerson : Yeah, Navann, just on the gross margin and breakout of OpEx, we didn't provide any explicit detail here. But overall, what we're planning for is an operating margin improvement of 30 basis points to 80 basis points on a comparable basis year-over-year, the midpoint being about 50 basis points. I think you'll expect most of that to be gross margin-led as we reinvest back into the business. Certainly, again, we feel good about the innovation cycle we have here and the potential for growth over time. We want to make sure we're making investments in the right areas in order to support that ultimately. Jay Mazelsky : Okay. I'd like to thank everybody for their questions this morning. We're now going to conclude our Q&A portion of this morning's call. It's been a pleasure to review another quarter and full year of strong IDEXX results. So, thank you again for your participation this morning and we'll conclude the call. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
