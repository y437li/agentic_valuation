Incorporated, Research Division Operator : Welcome, and thank you for standing by. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. I'd like to turn the meeting over to President Martin Mucci and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex first quarter fiscal 2014 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. Yesterday afternoon, after the market closed, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2013, and filed our Form 10-Q, which provides additional discussion and analysis for the results for the quarter. These documents are available by accessing our Investor Relations page at paychex.com. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month. On today's call, I will review the highlights for the first quarter in our operations, sales and product development areas. Efrain will review our first quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance. And then we'll open it up for your questions. We are off to a solid start in fiscal 2014. We made good progress toward our growth goals, with positive sales momentum, new product enhancements and geographic expansion. Additionally, our client satisfaction and client retention remain at record-high levels. Efrain will go into more detail on the financial results and comparisons. However, I'd like to provide you with some of the highlights for the quarter. Payroll revenue met our expectations, with growth exceeding 2% due to the increases in both checks per payroll and revenue per check. HRS revenue grew double digits for the first quarter as we continue to experience great success in selling 401(k), and HR outsourcing and other value-added solutions to our clients. Total service revenue grew 5%. Checks per payroll has improved for 14 consecutive quarters. First quarter growth was 1.6%, consistent with the growth rate experienced for the full year fiscal 2013. Our execution in service operations has continued to be excellent, demonstrated by our exceptionally strong client satisfaction results that are consistent with the record levels we achieved in fiscal '13. We believe that the industry-leading client service that we provide, combined with our innovative technology, sets us apart from the competition. The dedication of our employees has resulted in client retention that also remains at record levels. From a sales perspective, we saw very positive momentum during the first quarter, particularly in our core payroll, SurePayroll and HR service areas. We continue to grow revenue per unit as well. We recently announced that we are expanding our payroll and HRS offerings into South America through a joint venture arrangement in Brazil, a significant market with a growing economy. There have also been recent regulatory changes in Brazil, which we -- which present an opportunity for outsourcing payroll and HR services. In addition, yesterday we announced that we have acquired a payroll provider in Germany, allowing us to further expand our payroll operations in that market. This acquisition will increase our revenue, client base and product offerings in Germany and help us capture a greater share of the payroll market in that country. Our operations outside the U.S. do remain a small piece of our overall business, but we're excited to expand our international presence. From a technology perspective, continued investment in our SaaS solutions and mobility offerings position us for long-term growth. We have market-leading SaaS solutions, leveraging the latest technologies, and continue to invest significantly in online capabilities, as well as our mobile applications. We recently updated our smartphone apps, giving clients the ability to start, edit and submit payroll on the go. This, combined with the cleanest and fastest access to all of your information, whether you are an employee or employer, with 1 to 2 clicks, provides our clients with the best mobility app in our marketplace. We are excited that we have reached the milestone of over 100,000 downloads of our mobile app. Our SurePayroll product, which also is a SaaS solution, continues to do well with strong double-digit sales and revenue growth. In fiscal 2014, health care reform is one of our most important initiatives, as this legislation is expected to have far-reaching effects on businesses and employees. During the first quarter, we launched new comprehensive solutions to help with certain mandates under health care reform. These new solutions include our Paychex Employer Shared Responsibility Service, designed to make it easier for business owners to determine if the employer shared responsibility provision applies to them and the actions they may need to take. We also offer our new ESR Complete Analysis and Monitoring Services for those clients who want a more robust solution. The Paychex Benefit Account product allows employers to offer FSAs, HSAs and HRAs on a single platform with one debit card for their flexibility, and we will give employers access to the Paychex Private Exchange in conjunction with this product. We have also launched a new health care reform section on our website, designed to provide information and ways to navigate to employer solutions with regard to health care reform. In summary, we are off to a solid start for sales, service, product strength and financial performance for our fiscal 2014. And I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employee team. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer, to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Marty. Let me start with our standard legal disclosure. Refer to our press release that includes a discussion of forward-looking statements and related risk factors. As Marty indicated, first quarter results for fiscal '14 met our expectations and represented a solid start to the year. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter. I will provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of our '14 outlook. Total service revenue grew 5% to $598 million. Interest on funds held for clients declined 1% for the first quarter to $10 million. The result was a byproduct of the low, albeit improving, interest rate environment, offset by a 7% increase in average investment balances. Expenses increased 4% for the quarter, primarily in compensation-related costs. We continue to invest at a higher rate in product development and supporting technology and experience higher sales-related costs attributable to solid sales execution in the first quarter and sales force initiatives that began in fiscal 2013. Operating margin was 41% for the first quarter. Operating income net of certain items increased 8% to $245 million for the quarter. Typically, our first quarter reflects the highest operating income net of certain items as a percentage of total revenue in a given fiscal year. We expect operating margin for the full year to be approximately 38% as we continue planned investments during the balance of the fiscal year. Net income increased 6% to $163 million for the first quarter. And diluted earnings per share increased 5% to $0.44 per share for the quarter. Turning to payroll service revenue. It increased 2% in the first quarter to $395 million. We benefited from increases in checks per payroll and revenue per check, as Marty already mentioned. Our checks per payroll metric continued to grow, increasing 1.6% compared to the same period last year. This was an improvement over growth of 0.9% or approximately 1% experienced for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, a quarter that we think was impacted by timing. Revenue per check grew modestly as a result of price increases partially offset by discounting. And finally, timing of processing in the first quarter slightly impacted our growth rate. On the HRS revenue side, it increased 11% to $203 million for the first quarter. This increases -- increase reflects client growth in our retirement services, HR solutions and eServices products and price increases. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in average asset value of participant funds. Insurance services revenue growth reflected an increase in the number of health and benefits applicants and higher premiums in workers' compensation insurance services. With respect to investments and income, our goal is to produce -- to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We focus on ensuring we can meet all of our cash commitments to clients. On the short-term side, the primary investment vehicle is high-quality VRDNs and bank demand deposit accounts. In our longer -- portfolio, we invest primarily in high-credit-quality municipal bonds. Interest rates still remain low even though they're improving a bit. Combined portfolios have earned an average of -- rate of return of 1% for the first quarter compared to 1.2% for the same period last year. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased during the first quarter, primarily driven by the expiration of payroll tax cuts on December 31, 2012, which resulted in higher social security withholdings, favorable trends in checks per payroll and also client growth. Investment income decreased due to lower average interest rates earned, partially offset by an increase in average investment balance resulting from the investment of cash generated from operations. I'll now review the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong, with cash and total corporate investments of $925 million as of August 31, 2013, and no debt. This quarter, we entered into a new $500 million credit facility. It's intended to finance the working capital needs of the company. Funds held for clients as of August 31, 2013, were $3.9 billion compared to $4.1 billion as of May 31, 2013. As you know, funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.5 billion for the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 7%. Total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized losses of $8 million as of August 31, 2013, compared with net unrealized gains of $35 million as of the end of last fiscal year. This change to an unrealized loss position is due to recent increases in market rates of interest. Total stockholders' equity was $1.7 billion as of August 31, reflecting $128 million in dividends paid during the first quarter and $84 million of shares repurchased. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 34%. Cash flows from operations were $267 million for the first quarter, a 23% increase compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher net income and some timing, related to working capital items. During fiscal 2013, the board authorized the repurchase of up to $350 million of our common stock, with the authorization expiring at the end of fiscal 2014. During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we repurchased 2.1 million shares for approximately $84 million. We have reaffirmed our guidance for fiscal 2014 from what was presented to you in June. I'd like to remind you that our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Payroll service revenue growth, 3% to 4%, based on anticipated client base growth and modest increases in revenue per check. HRS revenue growth expected to be in line with recent experience, in the range of 9% to 10%. Total service revenue anticipated to be in the range of 5% to 6%. Net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 8% to 9%. Growth rate -- this growth rate is impacted in the fourth quarter, as in the fourth quarter of last year we recognized an additional tax provision for the settlement of a state tax issue, which impacted our diluted earnings per share by $0.04. Operating margin for the year is expected to continue to be approximately 38%. This is lower than what we experienced in the first quarter. But as I previously mentioned, our first quarter tends to be our highest-margin quarter of the year. We don't expect the expense leveraging result realized in the first quarter to continue quite at the extent [ph] throughout fiscal 2014 as we continue planned investments in technology innovation. Guidance for the other ranges, for interest on funds held and investment income, remain unchanged. I'll now turn it back to Marty. Martin Mucci : We will now open the meeting for any questions or comments that you may have. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Glenn Fodor, Autonomous Research. Glenn T. Fodor - Autonomous Research LLP : Just on the stock buyback in the quarter, you bought back a little over $80 million. Last quarter, you indicated that you would buy back to offset dilution. Your share count typically doesn't increase that much, and this slug of buyback, which you just did, basically offsets last year's 2 million share increase year-over-year. So as we think about this remaining $200 million or more, that's a lot more than you need to offset dilution. So I just want to see what your thoughts are around that. And also, the question is why buy back stock at a relatively high multiple when, clearly, investors prefer dividends -- prefer a higher dividend yield? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Glenn, thanks. Actually, our share count has been creeping up, so we're just trying to keep it more in line with what we've seen recently. I'd say we were in the market buying, last quarter. We do it opportunistically based on where we see the price settling. We won't -- we aren't necessarily committed to using the entire $350 million to purchase shares this quarter, but we'll look opportunistically to buy. I think with respect to the dividend, we had a nice increase there, 6% last -- in July we announced. We feel pretty comfortable with where we are with respect to dividend increase. So we'll look at opportunities to buy back based on what happens with respect to share price as we go through the year. Glenn T. Fodor - Autonomous Research LLP : Okay. And then just a final question on Brazil, just on the entry strategy. Just curious why enter the market by partnering with a portfolio company rather than an existing player with local expertise? The release referenced that this is a large CPA-based market. So was there just not an opportunity to partner with a broad CPA organization for referrals? Martin Mucci : No, I think the best opportunity was to partner with Semco. They were somebody who has helped other companies get started in Brazil. They have great connections there, great experience, very well respected. And we thought that the best way for us to get there, and get in there the quickest and most successfully, was with someone like Semco. So as we looked at various partnerships, they were certainly the best, and I think we'll move the quickest with them as well. Glenn T. Fodor - Autonomous Research LLP : Does that preclude you just going off and signing your own referral agreements with perhaps a CPA organization? Or is everything you do going to be through them? Martin Mucci : No, it's a partnership. They'll help us get started in there because of the connections and experience, but we're already working with CPAs in that area directly. We'll be running it day-to-day, and we'll be working with CPA and the CPA community to get the referrals and everything. That's already started actually, as we gear up for a first quarter calendar start. Operator : The next question is from David Togut of Evercore Partners. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Marty, you highlighted improving sales execution in the quarter in core payroll and HR services. Can you quantify year-over-year bookings growth in the August quarter so we can gauge the financial impact of what you signed in the quarter? Martin Mucci : No, we -- Dave, we don't give that much -- we've never given that much specific on the sales. I will tell you though that we've now seen at least 3 quarters now, and of course, we get an extra month in here that -- since we released the quarter. We feel very good about the sales execution, particularly in those markets. I mean, they're -- we're really seeing some nice sales growth, and we don't typically quantify it. We talk a little bit about the selling season after the January quarter. But we do feel very good, and it's very consistent. So even though small business starts haven't quite picked up as much, our execution on the sales side is going very well. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : To what do you attribute the improved bookings? I mean, is it just execution? Is it new products? I mean, what are the drivers of higher bookings? Martin Mucci : I think it's a combination, and I think the execution is very good. We've got some new leadership in there over the last couple of years. I think we've gotten some very good training programs underway. And I think the product execution has been good. The mobility platform is completely solid now and has been out there. We've been introducing a number of other products and so forth. So I think it's product innovation, I think it's execution by the sales team. And I think, businesses -- I think that CP -- like the CPA relationships, the referrals are picking up again. And so where new business starts haven't quite -- they're still a little sluggish, the CPA referrals have really started to pick up again very strongly. And we're doing well against regional competitors in particular. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : I see. And just on that vein, Marty, you've indicated you have a next-generation suite of products coming out in the November, December time frame. There's a little discussion of that in your 10-Q, particularly in integrated workforce management solution. Can you give us some more details about what you have coming up in November, December in terms of new products and what's the actual advance over your existing product functionality today? Martin Mucci : Yes, sure. I think the -- what we've seen that we released in kind of the June, July time frame and then in the -- coming up in the November, December time frame, it's much more about, I would say, integration. Particularly for the mid-market space, the over 50, you're going to see much better integration of the product set. So we have a complete set of products, time and attendance online, HR administration, benefit enrollment, expense management and so forth. But I think here you're -- what you're going to see is much more integration of that. We've had single sign-on, but you're going to have a cleaner look and feel and integration between the products, including one of the key things for employers, which is the ability to update all of their employee information and do edits on that information. That will come even easier than it is today. So I think that what we feel is we're making this -- we have a full product suite, but the integration, the look and the feel and the use of the product by the client will be even better than it ever has been. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Got it. Just a quick final question for me. You probably saw ADP had a high-profile Innovation Day yesterday, some new products focused on the mid-market. I don't know if you had any reaction to that in terms of what they're introducing relative to your existing product set. How should we think about competitive dynamic, particularly in the mid-market? Martin Mucci : Well, I think, obviously, they have been a good competitor. They continue to be a good competitor. I think we're very much head to head in this mid-market and -- with some others, and I think we have a very competitive suite of products. We'll get even better in the fall time frame, and we kind of just keep introducing things. I've never felt better, frankly, about our innovation in our product suite than I have over the last few years, as we've introduced all of our mobility, a full suite that's out there now, including doing all the payroll online. And certainly, all of our online products, our SaaS-based product set, I feel very good and very competitive with everything that they're offering. Operator : The next question is from Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein. Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : So is your net price increase year-to-year tracking at less than 1% growth? Efrain Rivera : No, it's not. Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : So is it right at 1%? Efrain Rivera : It's above 1%, for sure. It's in the range we've said, 2% to 4%. Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Okay. All right. And so can you give us an update on the growth in the client base and whether you can get that on track to grow positively in fiscal '14? Efrain Rivera : Yes. It's -- I'd say what we always say at this time, Rod. So if I stop here and tell you where our client base is, it's grown from end of year, and we think we're on track to get to where we need to be. I caveat that always, that the selling season, because it represents so much -- a large portion of our sales, is going to dictate whether we get net client growth. But we're off to a good start, and we feel pretty good. To the extent that you're wondering why growth was 2.4% versus a higher number, that really has to do with the calendar and the amount of processing days in Q1 of this year. Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Okay. All right. But do you think with the bookings performance that you've had in recent months, you actually are in a position to post some organic client base growth in fiscal '14? Efrain Rivera : Yes, we're expecting. That's what we're working against, yes. Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Okay. And can you quantify that target? I mean, is it positive 1% or positive 3%? I mean what's the goal there? Efrain Rivera : The range is 1% to 3%. We hope to be higher rather than lower, but we think it will be positive. Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Okay, great. And then finally, just on the margin front, you had some decent year-to-year margin expansion, x float. And I guess I'm wondering, as the year wears on, will your spending pace go up as the fiscal year wears on. Or can you sustain this level of year-to-year margin expansion? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So I think, certainly, over the last 3 years, what you've seen is that we start a little bit slower in terms of ramping spending in the year, and then by the time we get to fourth quarter, then our spending goes up. So I think we'll follow the same pace this year. We're not intending to leverage the same way we did this quarter in future quarters. So our margin guidance, we feel pretty comfortable about where we're at. Operator : Next question from Jason Kupferberg, Jefferies. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : So not to split hairs on the core payroll growth, but like you mentioned 2.4%, a little below the full year guidance range of 3% to 4% rather than kind of being around the low end of 3%. And I think that's what you guys were looking for last quarter. So was there some delta versus your expectations when all things -- when things where all said and done? And can you talk about the acceleration, the drivers of the acceleration that you'll need to get to the full year range? Because the year-over-year comparisons do get a little bit tougher each successive quarter, the rest of the year. Efrain Rivera : Yes. So from an expectation standpoint, it was about where we expected. Look, 0.1% would have rounded us up to 3%. It really -- now we're really splitting hairs. We knew that we were going to end up with 1 less processing day in the quarter, which is what's driving that low number. It will normalize as we go through the year, and that's really kind of what's driving the lower payroll revenue number. Obviously, as we sit here, we have 4 months of results that we know. We feel pretty comfortable at least through next quarter, if not a bit beyond that, that we're going to be in the range on payroll service revenue. Martin Mucci : Yes. We feel good about the price increase and how that's holding. We feel good about the sales performance and -- now for 3 or 4 quarters actually. And we're feeling consistent that we'll certainly be in our guidance range, and we feel very good about that at this stage. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. I mean, is the -- would you encourage folks to think about the lower end of the guidance being more likely, just given where you're starting at here in Q1? Or has your view on where you might fall in the range not changed at all because you don't have any year-over-year processing day headwinds the rest of the fiscal year? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I think we're in the middle of that range. I don't think we're ready to say it's at the low end of the range. Actually, if anything, Jason, I think we are -- we've got 4 months of sales results and feel pretty good about where we're at. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. And can you give us some insight into how much leeway your salespeople have out in the field when it comes to making pricing and discounting decisions, either signing up new clients or doing renewals of existing customers and whether or not any of those policies have changed materially over the last year or so? Martin Mucci : No. They really haven't changed. We've always given them some flexibility. We don't say how much, for competitive reasons, but they've always had the same level of flexibility. And I think the one thing that we've seen over the last -- this is the second year now, second fiscal year, is definitely an increase in the revenue per client that they're selling, though. And so we feel very good about their managing. They're incented to sell for the most revenue they can. That's how they're paid, is a percentage of the revenue that they sell. So they certainly have an incentive to sell -- to get the most revenue for the sale. But at the same time, they have flexibility to discount within reason, and that has not changed. But in fact, I think the results have gotten even better. I think it's just better execution from the sales force. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : And then just a last housekeeping item. Is there any material amount of revenue or costs built into the fiscal '14 guidance for the Brazil joint venture or the Germany acquisition? Efrain Rivera : No, not really. Brazil will be really, really negligible this year. We're really just getting ramped up. We'll have a little bit of additional revenue from Germany, but it will be pretty immaterial to our results. Operator : Next question from Kartik Mehta, Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : Marty, you talked a little bit about the health care stuff in your opening remarks. And I'm just wondering, as these new ACA rules are coming down, how -- what you would expect for Paychex in terms of maybe opportunities or challenges over the next 12 months as this law goes into effect. Martin Mucci : Yes. I think the opportunity is that we -- the good thing is we have the products out. We got them out early. We have very -- a complete -- everything, from the shared responsibility kind of report to a better -- to a more full, complete monitoring service right to the full exchange to be able to help clients, with a combined card that you can put everything on the one card and -- FSA, HSA and HRAs and then even get to an exchange. So I think the opportunity is good, and I think that we were well ahead on this one to get the products out in front of clients. I think the only negative is that with all the confusion and then the delay of the employer side of it, I think people are still really kind of up in the air as to what to do, particularly small business. And I think that will start to clear out a little bit here, the next few months it looks like, as the exchanges have now opened up, at least signing up for the exchanges today. And I think that, that will clear up. So I think it's a nice opportunity. We have not baked a lot in, into our forecast, for that because we just think it's a little bit too early to know what it's worth. But I feel really good from a product standpoint, also from a training standpoint of our sales teams and the fact that it gives a lot of good opportunity for us to just go in and talk to the clients and prospects about it. So good opportunity, still a little bit early to tell how much it's really going to be worth to us. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : And then, Marty, as far as discounting is concerned, if you look to discounting this selling season versus last selling season, any change or is it about the same in terms of what you're having to do? Martin Mucci : I would say roughly it's about the same. But if anything, we've seen the revenue on the sales go up per client. So I think, if anything, maybe it's dropped a little bit. We were getting stronger on the price increase that we did. So I would say that the discounting is the same or even slightly less, given the revenue per client that we're seeing coming in on the sales. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : And just one last question, Efrain, for you. On the float, you had -- we had 7% increase in the balance this quarter. Would you anticipate for the full year a similar type of increase? Or do you think it moderates a little bit for the full year? Efrain Rivera : No, it moderates in the back half, Kartik, because we're still anniversary-ing the repeal of the -- or the expiration of the payroll tax credit. So in the back half of the year, it will normalize and then we'll be back to more kind of an inflation plus 1 kind of range, maybe 3% or so. In other words, so we won't have the benefit of that expiring payroll tax that occurred in January. Operator : Next question from Tim McHugh, William Blair. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Efrain, first, I want to ask, just to clarify on the processing day topic. If my recollection is correct, we had fewer processing days in the year-ago quarter as well. So is it one less than even you had in the year-ago quarter? Or is it one less... Efrain Rivera : Compared to last year, we had one less day in this quarter. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay. And it's as simple as we think about the impact of 90 calendar days and 1-day impact? Or how should we. . . Efrain Rivera : Yes. I think that's roughly it, Tim, yes. So just to clarify a little bit. So you have the days, but there was one less business day in this quarter, and it will normalize through the year. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay. And is there a particular -- do you know when we would catch that back up? Efrain Rivera : I think, looking at the quarter, it looks like in Q3. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay. All right. And then, I guess, just I had a high level, I guess. Can you talk about international expansion? So you've done Brazil and now you've announced Germany, a small acquisition there. Are you more aggressively going to be pursuing international expansion? And I guess, just to be direct, address the skeptic, the skeptical argument would be that, that's a sign you're less confident about the U.S. growth. Martin Mucci : Yes. I'd like to address that one because it's not the case at all. The growth internationally is something that we started to take a look at, actually, a couple of years ago. We're trying to push growth always. And so we decided -- Germany, we've been doing well in Germany, but we had not put a lot of attention on it, in my opinion. And so we felt that there was opportunity to really grow there, so we went off looking for acquisitions and other ways to grow. We added sales reps there to our existing operation and then look -- and continue to look for acquisition opportunities there because we're there, we already have a good presence, good reputation and we're trying to grow that. Then we said, \"Look, what other countries do we think would be the best to go into to add to our growth?\" And Brazil, with it's going 5 million to 6 million businesses, small businesses, and some changing regulatory environment, which are going to require more electronic filing and more difficulty for small business to do things themselves, decided that, that was the place to go and went off with Semco to start that operation in the next few months here. And then, we're looking at other countries as well. But it's really not at all about thinking that the U.S. market is behind. We feel -- actually, I probably never felt better, certainly in the last 3 years, about our sales execution, our product set and the level of client service and retention that we have. So we feel good about the U.S. market. We've added sales reps over the last couple of years, and we target them at different growth opportunities, including, like we said, the franchise environment, where we picked up Subway's recommendations [ph] and Tim Hortons. We've gone after bank channel much stronger. So it's really just a chance to go at growth in every different way that we possibly can. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : And on the international front, you talked about you're looking at other countries. What's your strategy or approach going to be? Are you going to pick 2, 3, 4 and really focus on trying to make those work? Or are you looking to have a number of these markets start to ramp up all at once, so I guess, you can maybe have a bigger geographic presence in Europe or something like that? Martin Mucci : Yes. Our approach, Tim, would be much more about going for fewer and getting a stronger hold in those countries. So expand Germany because we already had a hold there and really, take a bigger market share there; go after Brazil because of the big opportunity we think there, and growing, and the regulatory changes; and probably another country that we're looking at. And it could be just payroll products or it could be actually an expansion of the product set that gets us into that country. But it would be fewer countries with more presence would be the way we'd go. We think it's more efficient and certainly, has a better level of success and margin for us. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Great. And then last, just on the Germany acquisition, can you give us any sense of the size of that in terms of, like.... Efrain Rivera : It's pretty modest, Tim. So we won't disclose the actual amount of sale. But it certainly increases our footprint. Martin Mucci : Yes. I think if you look at it from a size of clients and revenue, it's significant from where we are today, but it's still a small piece of our overall revenues and so forth. But it gives us a nice pickup in the Berlin area, where we were more in Hamburg and some of the other cities. We now have every major city in Germany, and I think we'll really get the name known well. Operator : Next question from Joseph Foresi, Janney. Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : This is Jeff Rossetti in for Joe. Marty, just a follow-up on the health care rollout that you mentioned. Are you still targeting a material impact in the second half of calendar 2014? Martin Mucci : I don't know if I'd say it's material. We didn't really bake much in for the guidance and so forth because we just didn't know how it was all going to play out. So I would say we're expecting it to start to pick up steam this quarter a little bit, but I don't think it's going to have a significant revenue impact, knowing the size of our clients and what we charge and so forth, until next year. I think we'll start to see some pickup, and we'll be able to give you, I think, a lot better feel for it at the end of the second quarter and into the third. Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Okay. And just on your sales force growth and win rate, just wanted to see if there was any kind of deviation from what you last talked about, maybe you're tracking about 2% sales force growth. I just want to see if maybe you could talk about if there was any change on the win rate side across the 4 or 5 client bases you have. Martin Mucci : Yes. I'd say it's still pretty consistent. The 2% to 3% kind of growth in sales force is certainly consistent. And the win rate, the competitive environment, I think, is very similar. I think it's competitive, but we haven't really seen the win-loss rate change much -- too much at all. But I think what we're seeing is a lot more activity in presentations starting to pick up, and therefore, when you're winning even the same amount at more presentations, you're obviously starting to pick up some wins there. Operator : Next question from Paul Thomas, Goldman Sachs. Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : So you were talking about the improved momentum that you're seeing. Could you talk a little more about interest in the online channels? Have you seen any increase in search activity, or meaningful increase, in the last quarters or seeing a little more positive sentiment from small businesses? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think we are seeing -- while I don't think new business starts have -- they are still a little sluggish. I do think in certain areas of the country, where -- I've talked about this before, where housing is starting to pick up, home sales and building of new houses are starting to pick up, that's giving us a little bit uptick in new business starts there. Online, we're certainly -- search is becoming a bigger part of our referrals, and I think we've done a really good job on our website of attracting the search and then capitalizing on it from a sales perspective. And then, if your question was also online interest, just online for our online payroll's certainly picked up interest as well. Now with our model, clients have a dedicated payroll specialist but they can go online to do -- to make changes, to do their payroll if they want, the next week go back to the specialist. They always have that specialist dedicated to them, though, to help them through it, answer questions, et cetera. So we've seen a pickup in the online interest of all of our clients as well, as you'd probably expect. Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. Then on HRS, that was strong in the back half of last year, and that was a trend that you had talked about not continuing this year. Is that your -- still your expectation? Or are you seeing a little more sustained momentum there? Martin Mucci : I think we're -- obviously, we feel very good about the 11% pickup in the first quarter over last year with HRS, our HR outsourcing and 401(k), et cetera. We're feeling good about it. One quarter doesn't make a year, so we're not ready to change guidance or anything because there's some tougher comparison there as well. But we're certainly feeling very good. 401(k) continues to be very strong. We still lead in that marketplace. We have more 401(k)s than anyone else, new or existing, from our recordkeeping. Our work with financial advisers has been very successful. That was a group we really started last year. And going after larger plans also has been very successful, so 401(k) doing well. And with all of the health care reform, the PEO side of the business, as well as ASO, but PEO picking up some steam, too. So I think we'll know more in the next quarter as we head into selling season, but it's -- all of it's going pretty well. Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. Maybe just one more for me. Thinking about growth in adjacent markets for Paychex, has there been any recent discussion around entering another space, like merchant acquiring, given the relationships you already have with small businesses? I guess at least one merchant acquirer found payroll interesting enough to buy a payroll company. Have you guys given any more thought to that space recently? Martin Mucci : Yes. We've tested that out. Actually, I think I've mentioned it before, that we've been testing that. We're trying it at different ways to sell merchant processing with a partner and -- who do the actual processing, but we've been selling it because of the access. It's starting to pick up. It's still small, and I would say we're having some success with it. But we're trialing it, and we'll have, I think, more evidence here in the next quarter or 2, trying it different ways. Other markets, other adjacent things, we're certainly looking at, and I think you'll hear from us soon on some other things that we're looking at getting into, where we think we have such a great distribution model with our sales force, as well as our web work -- website work, that I think we've got some other adjacent products that we'll be able to introduce as well. Operator : Next question from Sara Gubins, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : You mentioned, in the selling season, seeing some pickup in revenue per client. Is that being driven by taking on -- them taking on incremental services? Or is it really pure payroll service? And sort of secondarily, do you think it's being driven by any change in the size of new clients? Efrain Rivera : I think size of client is not a significant change, Sara. But I would say that we've given the sales force now a range of products that they can sell as they go in, including, for example, time clocks, and that has been successful. So they have a range of products that they can talk to clients about. And I think they've got the right incentives in place to drive higher revenue -- get the right revenue per unit. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Is there any way to distinguish between how much of that is helping as opposed to the price increases sticking? Efrain Rivera : Price increases, I think we've given you the range so you'll be able to kind of see that flow through the P&L as we go through the year. It's partly some price increase, but really, it's more being able to capture higher revenue with clients because they've got a more complete bag of products they can sell. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, great. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned expecting margins for the rest of the year not to see the same kind of leverage that you got in the first quarter, partial seasonality and then also partial investments that you're planning. Could you give us a little bit more detail about the planned investments? And I'm wondering if that will continue past this fiscal year. Or if it's still sort of the catch-up in technology that might then wind down? Efrain Rivera : Well, I think I'll let Marty talk about the details of the technology a little bit more. But I think that through the balance of the year, this is probably one of our biggest years in terms of technology releases that we've had. So that investment is going to continue. With respect to looking out beyond this year, it's tough, Sara, to call that precisely because, obviously, the market keeps changing. We understand that we need to continue to make investments, and we evaluate that year-to-year in terms of what we need to do to our product suite to remain at the leading edge. And I would just say this, I don't -- I wouldn't characterize what we're doing now as playing catch-up. In important respects, we're ahead of competition, and we want to remain that way. Martin Mucci : Yes. I think that the investment in the technology will continue. I think we've mentioned before that it kind of peaked out, so I don't think we'll see big increases in that continue. And our focus is always on balancing spending -- increased spending for growth opportunities. We're trying to drive the top line growth, and we'll balance that with always trying to leverage. So I don't think you're going to see margins drop off. I don't think they're going to go up dramatically. But we're always looking to leverage the revenue dollar as we increase and maintain industry-leading margins out there for operating income. That's certainly our goal. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay. And then just last quick question. On the last earnings call, you mentioned expecting first half and second half earnings to be fairly comparable on an absolute basis. Is that still the case? Efrain Rivera : I'd have to look kind of where we're at here, but we haven't changed the guidance. So I think you just have to adjust based on where we ended the quarter. Operator : Next question from Ashwin Shirvaikar, Citi. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I guess my first question is, if I look at the payroll services growth on a sequential basis, obviously, the August quarter is the best growth you typically have due to pricing. But other than 2009, this is sort of the worst sequential growth in 10 years. And actually, if I adjust for a day of processing, that overall conclusion is still not so much different. So I'm kind of thinking, is that because of maybe a declining level of pricing power? Or is this a sign that maybe the end market is more penetrated or different in some way? If you can help me, particularly with the penetration and market size question. Efrain Rivera : Yes. I'd have to look at what you're looking at, Ashwin. So if I look at first quarter of last year, the sequential comparison between Q4 of the prior year and the first quarter last year would have been the worst sequential growth we've seen. We were only at less than 1%. So I'm not entirely certain your -- what numbers you're looking at. Because we were at 1% a quarter ago -- a year ago quarter, and we're about 2.5% this year. So I'm not sure about the sequential growth. [indiscernible] Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : No, I'm looking at 1Q over 4Q revenues. Efrain Rivera : Without getting into kind of a long discussion on what the details of Q1 were, I think what you have to step back and look, because recurring revenue businesses like ours are sensitive to the amount of days and the kind of days in the processing period. And what we've been looking at is, last year, we had about 2% payroll growth. There were a number of unusual factors in that -- in-year, not the least of which was Hurricane Sandy, and we're guiding to 3% to 4%. So I don't think the trajectory is downwards. Actually, this year the trajectory is upward, and we still feel comfortable that, that's where we're going. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Right. No, we could take that offline. I was looking at 1Q over 4Q, if you just see what revenues did because that partly takes into account the impact of days and so on. But we could take that offline. I guess a follow-on question I'm trying to understand, is with regards to as you do more bundling of services, which really is the way to go, and you guys have shown traction on that, so what -- I mean, what actually happens, the economics of the client, where you get more bundling versus less bundling? How should we think of that? And what's the penetration of that bundled set offerings today, if there's a number you can give us? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think we've always had a lot of different bundles that we offer. And I guess what I would say is bundling has been very good for us, in the fact that we've continued to drive up the revenue per client, particularly in the last 2 years. Now we had some pricing changes we made a few years ago in a bundle that lowered that price, and -- but we made adjustments to that 2 years ago, last year. And so the bundling has been good, and the bundles have driven the overall revenue up per client. So to us, the economics have been good. You're selling a full suite of products, it's easier for the client, it's easier for the sale, and it's driven up the revenue per client on new sales. So we feel pretty good about it. Efrain Rivera : And we disclose a lot of our -- a lot of information in that respect. And you can see that our revenue per client has been going up, and it's driven by that approach, frankly, across all of the product sets that we sell. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Right. I was trying to get more to the -- sort of the profit per client with regards to -- does that help delivery, if you have bundled offerings? Efrain Rivera : The short answer is yes, it does help profit per client. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay, okay. And the last question I have is, as some of these products are showing traction, 401(k) obviously, health care you're expecting to do quite well this year, what should we look forward to. I mean, are these more profitable than sort of any of the other core offerings that you have, where we can maybe see a step-up in core profitability, if you will? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So I don't think, necessarily, it's going to drive margins up, not because the profitability or the margins on these products are different than core. They're actually comparable. I make this point when I'm asked frequently that the profitability of HRS services, with the exception of insurance, is basically very close to what our payroll services profitability is. So it won't necessarily drive margins higher because the margin on these products is higher. But what you will see, as you get higher revenue growth, you have more opportunity to leverage. And so from that standpoint, higher revenue growth or more rapid revenue growth is going to drive better opportunities for leverage. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Got it. Efrain, last question. And this one is on the -- on your response to the question that was asked earlier on the buyback. Should we sort of take away from your response that essentially you're trying to manage the shares outstanding. Basically, it's not an indication of attractiveness or otherwise of the stock? This is -- basically, you're trying to manage to a share count number, right? Efrain Rivera : We are. Obviously, I have a responsibility, Marty does, too, to make those investments wisely. So we take that responsibility seriously. But yes, I think that's the direction. Martin Mucci : Yes, definitely. I think, at least dilution, we're trying to cover dilution, which is not something we've been that active in before. And it's because, really, the dilution wasn't that much. But share count, as Efrain mentioned earlier, has really -- has picked up some in the last year or so as the stock price went up. So we're definitely looking with the board -- with what the board approved to manage at least dilution. Operator : Our next question is from David Grossman, Stifel. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Just 2 really quick follow-up questions to topics I think that have already been addressed. The first one is, obviously, you've talked about some new products that will be more integrated, more seamless to the end user and that gets to the whole notion of bundling. Can you give us any examples in terms of attach rates or something that would give us a better understanding of what the economics are when you're able to sell an integrated solution versus some of the single-point product sales that have typically happened over the last several years? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think when you look at -- this is really in the 50-plus space, where you see Time and Attendance online, our product that we've had for a number of years, HR administration, BeneTrac, our online benefit enrollment offering. And then now we've picked up ExpenseWire and mystaffingpro over -- in the recent past. As you attach each one of those, obviously, the more revenue per client. Not only do you get more revenue per client and the margins are just as good, but the retention of the clients are better as well because it's stickier. You've got more arms and legs into it. The biggest thing with a client is, \"Okay, when I have these various products, how well do they integrate?\" And so I think that from an economics -- from that standpoint, I guess a margin standpoint, it's better when we combine more things, and we've integrated the technologies more and more together. So we have a single sign-on, where you sign on to one place and get on. But now we want to make them -- you'll see them looking more consistently. You'll see them being able to use more consistently. We'll have a single place for updating people information, client, employee information. And so the attachment rate is obviously the strongest on the HR administration. In fact, I think we sell more HR administration. We lead with it, I guess I should say, as opposed to payroll, so the retention or the attachment there is very strong. The TLO, time and attendance online would be next. That attachment is probably just below the HR. And in fact, most normally, we sell that bundle of time and attendance, HR administration and payroll combined together in the 50-plus market with pretty high attachment rates over -- I'd say, over 50%. It won't get to -- certainly, over 50% because that's what they're looking for, that full suite of services. Under 50, we pretty much sell the whole bundle, and the attachment is there. So everything is attached. Obviously, the tax filing is close to 100%, and everything else is very close. We still have a lot of opportunity to sell add-ons. Of course, workers' comp insurance and all of our health insurance, they're still very low attachment and penetration at this point, but we've got a big base to go after and a big opportunity. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : So really, the increment for the bundle is more in the middle market right now than it is in the less than 50 market? Martin Mucci : It is for the technology increases and the products rolling out in the fall, the rest of them rolling out in the fall. That's more, I would say, targeted toward that 50-plus mid-market. We have the product set and pretty good attachment, but still lots of opportunity on the under 50 on the ancillary products. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Got it. And then, secondly, you talked a little bit about what you're doing in terms of some of your ACA-targeted solutions. And maybe just a clarification, did you say that you are going to set up your own exchange or you're just going to have the bundled solution that can be used in conjunction with the exchanges that are out there? Martin Mucci : We have a bundled solution basically with the HSA, HRA and FSA together on one card that will help the client and the employee prioritize their payment. And it's tied -- we also can then help you get to an exchange through a partner. So it is -- but it is labeled, white label to Paychex exchange, but it's with a partner. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : And who is the partner? Martin Mucci : I don't know if we've released that yet so I'll -- let me look at that and see whether we haven't released that yet. And I want to be sure that, that's comfortable with them -- from their standpoint. But they're a big player in that market that have exchanges out there. Operator : Question from Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I got on a little bit late. I think most of the questions have probably been asked. But I just want to ask a question on the pickup in activity and the pickup in presentations. What exactly do you think is driving that? Martin Mucci : I think, honestly, Brian, I think it's really good execution. We had some turnover issues a couple of years ago, and I think as you bring newer reps in, they're not -- they don't have the relationships built up with the CPAs, the current clients, et cetera. That has really matured, our turnover in the sales force has been dropping. We're at a very good place right now, particularly year-to-date, on sales force turnover. As they build the relationships, the referrals come in. They're getting a lot more presentations in there. I also think that certainly the product set, the mobility platform, having a great mobile platform out there now on the smartphones and everything has been very positive to get them in the door. And health care reform has been a great opportunity to get in the door, start talking to prospects about health care reform and then that develops into a lead for more payroll and other products. Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : And that kind of leads into my next question. I was going to ask about strategy going into the big selling season. Are there things that you're going to be doing differently or pushing differently this year versus other years in the past? Martin Mucci : I think it will be very similar. I think health care reform would be a little bit different from last year and trying to provide information to new clients and prospects that -- trying to help them navigate through all that. But other than that, I think we'll have very similar approaches. This is something we've been in for a long time. So I think it will be a very similar approach. We know it's competitive. But between our current payroll specialists giving referrals, CPAs, banks and our web work and incentives and so forth, I think it will be a very typical, but I think a very successful, selling season. Operator : Next question from George Mihalos from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : So just wanted to go back. Efrain, thanks for the color on the extra processing day and that headwind, I guess, anniversary-ing in the third quarter. But as we look at 2Q now, is there any reason why we should not see a sequential increase in core payroll growth given the other variables that you spoke about? Efrain Rivera : So I want to be careful because you had a negative in there, George. Let me just state a positive, we should see a sequential increase in Q2. Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay, okay. And you will see a further acceleration in the back half of the year despite seemingly tougher comps? Efrain Rivera : Should be better in the back half of the year, yes. Georgios Mihalos - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. And then just final question, just on SurePayroll, is there -- can you give us a sense of what growth rates you're seeing there? And I think in the past you've mentioned that firms with -- I believe the number was sub-7 employees seem to be flocking to the product. Are we seeing any change in terms of the composition of firms with perhaps larger employee basis taking a look at it? Martin Mucci : No, it's still very -- been very similar, and they're doing very well both -- they're double-digit sales and revenue growth. And they've continued to really -- they continue to really hit that market, in particular. Again, they are doing it through some great work in their marketing and their website because everything is inbound, is drawing the clients in. But they're still seeing kind of the same demographics of the client base, and they're performing and closing really well. Operator : Next question from Jeff Silber, BMO Capital Markets. Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I will just ask one quick one. Given the delay in tapering from the Fed, I'm just wondering if there's been any change in your investment philosophy and if you can just remind us what that is in terms of duration. Efrain Rivera : Yes. So we're about a little over 3, about 3.3 years in duration. I will say that interest rates have really bounced all over the place in terms of the intermediate municipal market. We've seen swings of 40, 50 basis points, 30, 40 basis points. So we're a little bit cautious in terms of how we're investing and staying a little bit shorter than we otherwise would because we think interest rates are going to bump back up. But with the recent pronouncement by the Fed, they came back down. We think second half of the year, they'll bump back up. So it's been pretty volatile in the intermediate-term municipal market. We're just approaching it somewhat cautiously in terms of extending. Operator : Our next question from Jim MacDonald, First Analysis. James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : Two quick ones. You mentioned in your release that direct costs had an impact or else it sounds like HR would have had a higher growth rate. Can you talk a little bit about that? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So what happened there, Jim, is that we -- workers' comp costs in the PEO this quarter, compared to the other quarter, were up. That's partly due to growth in the PEO and so that impacted the growth rate a little bit, just the way we do the accounting. James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : Any impact? Was it 1% or 2% of growth? Or... Efrain Rivera : Yes. I can't call it specifically. In terms of HRS, it would have been about 0.5% or less. James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : Okay. And just another quick follow-up. So given the share repurchase, congratulations, by the way, for getting that going. What can we expect -- I mean, do we -- can we expect share count to stay -- do you expect share count to stay flat from here or down a little bit from here? Because it did bump up in this quarter. Efrain Rivera : It did bump up. I would say flattish. We don't want decline too much. If we can get it down a little bit more, we'll try to do that. Operator : Our last question is from Mark Marcon, R.W. Baird. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Just a couple of quick questions from a short-term perspective and then a couple of longer-term questions. With regards to the short-term questions, would you expect -- I mean, just given where things are now, that the effective yield on the float basically stays relatively flat, in terms of the way that you gave your guidance? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I think so, Mark. Look, it's becoming increasingly difficult to call where interest rates are -- not that you have that much of a crystal ball to begin with, but hard to call where interest rates are going to be. So I would say that's our assumption right now. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, great. And then how could you expect the ACA trend up impacting just the core traditional PEO, not the ASO portion, but the PEO and then your health care insurance business? Martin Mucci : I think from the PEO standpoint, I think, Mark, it will be -- it's positive because small business employers are finding that with PEOs, generally, you might get a better health care increase because they can, obviously, combine themselves with the co-employer and have a better way to navigate through everything and get better premiums. And so I think that's going to be very positive. And then I think your other question was with just -- from an -- I guess it was from an ASO perspective? Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : No, just for your health care insurance. Martin Mucci : Health care insurance. I think it's just the fact that it has brought it to light. Everyone is concerned about it. Everyone's confused. It gives you an opportunity to get into the client and discuss with prospects various options that we can provide. And having the experience and a good strong sales team out there in the health care side, health insurance side, I think it will give us some positive momentum. So I think both on the PEO and the health insurance we'll be very positive. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Mark, I think you also may be asking about what happens in the smaller portion of the market. So on the lower end of the market we view many of those clients eventually gravitating into exchanges, but we still think there's an opportunity in the mid and upper portions of the market, which is the way we've directed our strategy over the last 18 months. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. So I mean, the low end might go away or might change, but the upper end is where you're really focused, so it's not going to impact your business? Efrain Rivera : Right, yes. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Great. And then with regards to the operating margins x float, you gave that 38% target, which is consistent with what you said last time. Does -- you would still expect to see some leverage almost every quarter through the balance of the year, and 38% is an approximation so it could be a little bit higher than 38.0%, correct? Efrain Rivera : That's correct. As I said, when I had many of these calls, 38.4% is approximately 38%. 37.8% is between 37% and 38%. So we're not going to call it any finer than about 0.5 point if we felt it was going to be beyond that. And obviously, if you look at our guidance last year and what we did, where we have opportunity to leverage, we'll take it and then move on. And we set a very high bar for ourselves in terms of how we spend. We don't need to spend, we won't spend. But at this point, 38% is as close as we're calling it. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : That's what I thought, I just want to make sure. And then, finally, when we think about SurePayroll and then think about -- and then maybe separately, international, how should we think about that over the next couple of years in terms of the contribution? Martin Mucci : Well, international remains small as far as an overall view of everything, but it's giving us growth. And we think, long term, it has great potential, and that's why we went after it. But we knew it's a longer-term play. But we certainly feel very good about the opportunities that we're in now and are looking at. And then, on SurePayroll, obviously, if they can continue to grow double digits like they have been. I think it really got us into a market that we wanted to get into. It's online. It's that smaller end. And I think they continue to execute very well, same management team leading it and doing a really nice job. And I think that, that certainly will get more sizable to us. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Are they driving a lot of the core payroll growth at this point? Efrain Rivera : No, they're not. Martin Mucci : No. Efrain Rivera : Absolutely not, no. They're too small, Mark. They're just way too small to do that. Operator : And we are showing no further questions. Martin Mucci : All right. At this point, we will close the meeting. If you are interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived until approximately November 1. Our Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held on October 16 at 10 :00 a.m. in Rochester, New York. That meeting will also be broadcast over the Internet. I thank you for the time that you're taking to participate in this call and for your interest in Paychex. Thank you very much. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. And now I'd like to turn your conference over to Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin, sir. Martin Mucci : All right, thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today for our discussion of Paychex's second quarter fiscal 2014 results. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. Yesterday afternoon, after the market closed, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2013. We will file our Form 10-Q, which provides additional discussion and analysis of the results for the quarter tomorrow, on Friday. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about one month. On today's call, I will share some thoughts on results and update you on how we're doing in operations, sales and product development, and Efrain will review our second quarter financial highlights and discuss our full year guidance. And then we'll open it up for your questions or comments. Let me start by saying we're pleased with second quarter results. We have made good progress toward our growth goals with continued positive momentum in sales, new product enhancements and geographic expansion. Client satisfaction and retention remain at record high levels for Paychex, and Efrain will go into more detail on the financial results and comparisons. However, I'd like to provide you with some highlights from my perspective. Total service revenue, and specifically, payroll service revenue, showed good growth of 7% and 5%, respectively. Payroll service growth at 5% as compared to 2.5% or 2.4% growth in the first quarter. HRS revenue continued to grow at double-digit rates in the second quarter as we continue to experience good success in selling and retaining 401(k), as well as HRS -- HR outsourcing services under both the PEO and ASO models. Our checks per payroll have improved for 15 consecutive quarters, and in the second quarter, experienced similar growth with the first quarter. Our execution in service operations has continued to be excellent, demonstrated by our exceptionally strong client satisfaction results. We believe that this industry-leading client service that we provide, combined with the innovative technology, sets us apart from our competition. From a sales perspective, we saw continued positive momentum during the second quarter, particularly in core payroll, SurePayroll and HR service areas, and we are well positioned for our important selling season that we're in now. We continue to grow revenue per unit as well. From a technology perspective, continued investment in our software-as-a-service solutions and mobility offerings position us well for the long-term growth. We have market-leading SaaS solutions, leveraging the latest technologies and continue to invest significantly in online capabilities, as well as our mobile applications. Whether you are a client or client employee, our mobile app provides a clean and efficient access to all of your information with 1 to 2 clicks, as well as the ability for clients to start, edit and submit their payroll with the best mobility app, we believe, in the marketplace. We have further broadened our SaaS solutions portfolio with the launch of Paychex Accounting Online. This cloud-based accounting service is being delivered through a strategic partnership and investment we made in Kashoo, a leading provider of cloud accounting services. Our entry into the cloud accounting market reflects our commitment to provide small businesses with the products they need to succeed. This complements our industry-leading payroll and HR Solutions by expanding our suite of services designed for small businesses and midsized businesses and entrepreneurs. This product will also further enhance the strong partnership we have with the CPA communities. In the past few quarters, I've talked about it -- our new products designed to help clients -- our clients manage the compliance requirements of the Affordable Care Act, more importantly known as health care reform. We continue to execute the rollout of our new product offerings in this area including our Paychex Employer Shared Responsibility Service, a more robust monitoring service, and our Paychex Benefit Account. We continue to see health care reform as an opportunity and have worked to get a great deal of information out in front of our clients as they work through all of the requirements of the Act. This selling season, our sales force is able to present options to clients and help them determine what will be beneficial for their businesses. During the second quarter, we completed an acquisition of a payroll service provider in Germany, which we mentioned during our first quarter call. While our operations in Germany are immaterial to the overall company results right now, we continue to expand our global footprint with this acquisition and our start-up operation in Brazil and drive for more presence and growth in the markets that we serve. We are pleased with the progress that we have made in product development and expansion as well, and we continue to execute on what we have brought to market. We have also continued with the shareholder-friendly actions. Our quarterly dividend is now at $0.35 per share, increased from $0.33 back in July. We have also continued to repurchase Paychex stock opportunistically. And we have repurchased approximately 4 million shares of common stock for a total of $159 million in the first 6 months of fiscal 2014. Recent results released from the Department of Labor are encouraging. These results indicate, we believe, a continued addition of new jobs and a moderation in the unemployment rate. This is indicative of the U.S. economy as it continues its broad and steady job growth. We have seen positive impacts in our checks per payroll growth and this bodes well for continued positive trends in our business. In summary, I am pleased with what I see as solid results for our second quarter and continued momentum for the first half of fiscal 2014. I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employee teams across the country and in Germany and Brazil. And I appreciate the great work of our -- and I appreciate all the work that they're doing in service and sales operations. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Marty. I'd like to remind everyone that during today's conference call, we'll make some forward-looking statements that will refer to future events, and as such, involve risks. Refer to our press release on a discussion of forward-looking statements and related risk factors. As Marty indicated, second quarter financial results for fiscal 2014 represented sequential improvement from the solid start we had for the year. Here are some of the key highlights of the second quarter and the 6 months. I'll provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of the full -- 2014 full year outlook. Total service revenue grew 7% in the second quarter to $601 million and 6% to $1.2 billion for the first 6 months. Interest on funds held for clients increased about 1% for the second quarter and was flat for the 6 months to $10 million and $20 million, respectively. Fluctuations were driven by an increase in average investment balances offset by the impact of continued lower average interest rates. As you saw on our interest on funds, though, this was the first quarter in a long while we're actually up slightly. Expenses increased 7% for the second quarter and 5% for the first 6 months. We continue to invest at a high rate in product development and supporting technology, and we experienced higher sales-related costs attributable to solid sales execution during the first 6 months in both core and -- core payroll and HRS products. Operating margin was 39.7% for the quarter and 40.4% for the first 6 months. Operating income, net of certain items, increased 8% for both the second quarter and the 6 months. We expect operating margin for the full year to be approximately 38% as we continue planned investments during the balance of the fiscal year. Net income increased 7% for both the second quarter and the 6 months to $159 million and $322 million, respectively. Diluted earnings per share increased 5% to $0.43 per share for the second quarter and 6% to $0.88 per share for the 6 months. Now turning to payroll service revenue. It increased 5% for the second quarter and 4% for the 6 months. We benefited from increases in checks per payroll and revenue per check. As Marty already mentioned, our checks per payroll increased during the second quarter, consistent with the 1.6% we experienced for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increase -- increases, net of discount, together with the impact of increased product penetration. Our second quarter growth benefited from the absence of the disruptive effects of Hurricane Sandy a year ago. During the second quarter last year, Sandy impacted our payroll revenue growth by approximately 0.5%. As a reminder, the growth rate for the last -- for last quarter was impacted by timing of processing as there was 1 additional processing day in the comparative quarter for fiscal 2013. And what I mean to say there is that, that was a reference to what happened in Q1. On HRS revenue, it increased 12% for both the second quarter and the 6 months. Both ASO and PEO revenues grew at double-digit rates. HRS revenue increased -- the HRS revenue increase reflects client growth, primarily in retirement services, HR solutions and eServices products. eServices continues to grow due to the success in the sales of SaaS solutions. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in average asset value of participants' funds. Insurance services revenue growth reflected higher premium in workers' comp insurance services and an increase in the number of health and benefits applicants. HRS revenue growth was tempered modestly by higher direct costs in our PEO. Note that HRS revenue quarterly growth can vary due to volume of clients; PEO worker's compensation and basis points earned on retirement services client employee funds; basis point changes due to fluctuations in the financial market and the asset value of funds invested. PEO net service revenue also exhibits greater variability between quarters due to a number of factors, including changes of workers' comp claims experience. Now turning to our investment portfolio. Our priority has been and will continue to be to ensure that we can meet all of our cash commitments to the clients. On the short-term side, our primary vehicle is high-quality variable rate demand notes. In our longer-term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit-quality municipal bonds. Our long-term portfolio currently has an average yield of about 1.6% and an average duration of 3.3 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.1% for the second quarter and the 6 months compared to 1.2% for the same periods last year. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased during both the second quarter and the 6 months, driven by the expiration of certain payroll tax cuts on December 31, 2012, which resulted in higher Social Security withholdings growth in checks per payroll and client growth. Our investment income increased due to -- decreased for the first 6 months due to lower average interest rates earned, partially offset by an increase in average investment balances, resulting from the investment of cash generated from operations. I'll now review the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $839 million as of November 30, and we have no debt. Funds held for clients as of November 30, 2013, were $3.9 billion compared to $4.1 billion as of May 31, 2013. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.5 billion for the 6 months, a year-over-year increase of 6%. Our total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $22 million as of November 30, 2013, compared with net unrealized gains of $35 million as of May 31, 2013. Total stockholders' equity was $1.8 billion as of November 30, reflecting $256 million in dividends paid during the first months -- first 6 months. Our return on equity over the past 12 months was 34%. Cash flow from operations were $400 million for the first 6 months, a 23% increase compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by higher net income and our noncash adjustments from net income, mostly depreciation and amortization, and premiums [ph] of available-for-sale securities and changes in our operating assets and liabilities relating to timing. I'd like to remind you that our outlook is based upon our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes with the exception of HRS revenue guidance is unchanged from the previous quarter. So payroll revenue growth, we expect it to be 3% to 4% for the year, that remains unchanged. HRS, given its strong performance in the first half of the year, we bumped that up 1 point to 10% to 11%. We think that total service revenue will still be in the range of 5% to 6%, albeit on the high end of that range. Net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 8% to 9%. This growth rate is impacted or affected because the fourth quarter of last year we recognized additional tax provision for the settlement of a state tax issue, which impacted our diluted earnings per share, another way of saying that we ended the year at $1.56 and that's the way at which we're computing that growth rate. Our operating margin for the year is anticipated to be approximately 38%. This is lower than the margin experienced in the first half of fiscal 2014, but as I previously mentioned, margins are historically lower in the second half of the fiscal year. We don't expect the expense leveraging realized in the first half of the fiscal year to continue throughout the remainder of fiscal 2014 as we continue our planned spending. We didn't disclose the anticipated range for interest on funds held for clients and investment income net. These ranges were provided in June and we don't anticipate a material change from those ranges. I'll turn it back over to Marty. Martin Mucci : Great. Thank you, Efrain. We will now open the meeting to questions, please. Teresa? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason, your line is open. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : This is Jason Kupferberg. Just a question on the core payroll. So it was interesting to us to see that on a quarter-over-quarter bases, core payroll was actually up a hair. I think, usually for seasonal reasons, it tends to be down quarter-over-quarter. So was this an issue in terms of number of processing days quarter-over-quarter? I know there was no change year-over-year, but if you could just comment on that and then maybe just remind us as we think about the back half of the year in terms of quarter-over-quarter changes in processing days, we should be considering for Q3 and Q4 because I think, year-over-year, Q3 has 1 more day, again, year-over-year while Q4 has one less, if I'm not mistaken? Efrain Rivera : Yes, you're right. So yes, good memory, Jason. So the answer is Q2 did not have any additional days so we had 65 processing days in Q2 of 2013. We had 65 processing days in Q2 of 2014. You are correct in both statements that you made. So in Q3, we will have 1 additional day of processing. We'll still have 65, but it turns out that last year in Q3 in 2013, we had 64. And we will have 1 less day in the final quarter of the year than we had the year before. When you total all of this up for the year, we have 1 less day overall. I am happy to report that next year, we have the exact same days in the exact same quarters, so I won't have to -- we won't have to keep discussing days. But you're right. So we'll have -- this quarter was, even with the prior quarter in terms of days, plus 1 in Q3, minus 1 in Q4. So we'll have 1 less processing day overall than we had last year. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : But just to clarify... Efrain Rivera : So no issues from a compare standpoint. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. What about even just quarter-over-quarter? I mean, fiscal Q1 '14 versus fiscal Q2 '14, was that also flat processing days? Efrain Rivera : No. In fiscal '14 versus 2013, I mentioned that in the call, we had 1 less day this year than we had last year. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Right. No, I was just asking Q2 this year versus Q1 this year. Efrain Rivera : Oh I'm sorry, Q2 versus Q1. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Yes, I'm just trying to -- because I'm just trying to get to how you guys saw a little bit of an increase in revenue sequentially here in... Efrain Rivera : Sorry, Jason, I didn't catch the question. No, we're comparable in terms of number of days in this quarter versus last year. So to answer your question, it really is 3 pieces. So the first, we mentioned checks per payroll, about 1.6 comparable to Q2. We keep saying that checks per payroll will moderate. They have moderated, but very slowly. The second is we see better pricing environment. And the third is we've had some client growth. So those are the 3 components of why we did better. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Was there as much as a couple of million or so from the acquisitions in the Brazil JV in this quarter [ph]? Efrain Rivera : No, no, no. The acquisition, which Marty mentioned on data, that was less than 0.2%. So it's really -- it's timing, I guess we should call it out specifically. And the JV isn't generating any revenue. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then just lastly, the organic client growth, I think, you're targeting for this current fiscal year is 1% to 3%. So wanted to understand kind of where you're running at the midpoint of the fiscal year-to-date here. And any better sense of where you might fall within that range, obviously understanding that the key selling season is upon us and that may be a key swing factor. But any color there would be great. Efrain Rivera : Yes, good question. So we still feel good about the range. We certainly, through the first 2 quarters, feel comfortable where we're at. Having said all of that, I'd just caveat what we say all the time, which is that the third quarter is a critical quarter for us not just from a sales standpoint, but also from a loss standpoint. So good trends. We feel pretty good. We're in the middle of selling season. We'll update you on where we're at. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Thomas, Goldman Sachs. Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Marty and Efrain, just following up on that last question. I guess could you talk a little bit more specifically about the price increases? How much of a benefit that was in the quarter? And Marty, I think you also mentioned that some of that was a product benefit as well. So if you could talk a little bit about the benefit of both of those in the quarter? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think just generally, we talked about price increases. We don't give specifically what we increase, but it was a consistent range. But I think what we're finding is the price increase was holding very well. We're not having to discount more. And in fact, we're getting a little bit more revenue per unit that we're selling as well. So we're feeling good. I would say the competitive market is about the same, but we're actually doing well from a price on a revenue-per-unit perspective. And then we're continuing to get more product per client as well, so more revenue per client in what we're selling. We've obviously offered some additional products, and so we're able to not only get good payroll pricing but also sell some additional products as well. Paul B. Thomas - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. Then could you talk a little more about the partnership with Kashoo? Should we think about that as more of an attachment to SurePayroll clients? Or are there opportunities for that in the 50-plus market as well? Martin Mucci : Well, I think it's primarily targeted to, certainly, under 20, I would say. And I think it's, for a start-up, it's a simple cloud accounting software package. We just saw it as another way to get into small businesses, help them get started, offer a broad range of products and a suite of products that tie to payroll. It will tie to SurePayroll. It could also certainly tie to core payroll, our small business payroll at Paychex, because a lot of clients -- obviously, 80% of our clients are under 20. So I think it's a good fit for both of them. We're kind of just getting started, but it's getting some nice attention already just as we've rolled out the Paychex Accounting Online private-labeled version of it. Operator : The next comes from Rod Bourgeois from Bernstein. Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : I just wanted to inquire about the PEO business and to what extent there will be impact from Obamacare. Can you just summarize? I'm assuming there are some significant positives, but there also could be some negative implications of Obamacare. Can you just outline that for us? What are the major positives and the potential negatives that could stem from Obamacare as you look at the PEO business going forward? Martin Mucci : Yes. From the PEO business, I think, for the most part, it's been a positive that we've experienced so far, which is the fact that in that PEO co-employer status, it's making the -- it's a great sales opportunity to get in front of people and say that we're going to be able to help them by bringing them into the PEO being a co-employer and working them through the requirements and that we have the expertise to be able to handle their needs. So I think it's been certainly a positive for those clients who are concerned about the requirements. Everything keeps changing when things are due, when it's going to take effect. And so the PEO business is seeing, I think, a nice uptick from that. Not huge, but it's certainly seeing some positive momentum for it. From a negative perspective, I think, it's -- I don't know. Overall, I think, the negative perspective is just the disruption that it causes new business start-ups in general as to whether to add an additional business, whether to start up your business, whether to invest in health care at all because you're just not sure what it's going to cost you and what the requirements and possible tax implications are going to be for your employees. So I'm not so sure, Rod. I think the negatives are frankly across-the-board more than they are specifically for the PEO. And right now, at least in the short term, it's a positive for the PEO. Efrain, anything you want to add to that? Efrain Rivera : No. Rod, the other thing I'd add to what Marty is saying is that in the short term, the pluses are dwarfing any negatives. And one of the things that was implicit in what Marty said was that you have an ability to underwrite pretty successfully within the PEO in a time when most insurance companies are struggling to figure out what their requirements are. And so in this window of time, PEOs have an advantage because they understand their cost structure, self-insured to some extent, and are able to go to market with a pretty clear offering. Over time, that could change. I would say that's a potential negative as the exchanges get up and running and then become, perhaps, pricing changes. But in the short term, we're certainly seeing -- reaping the benefits of that trend. Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : That's helpful. And then one other question. When we spoke 3 months ago, we were inquiring about whether you think your payroll client base can show positive growth for the fiscal year. And you expressed confidence that, that could be achieved. How do you stand on that now? Do you feel more confident at this point that you can have growth in the number of payroll clients for fiscal '14? Efrain Rivera : I think we feel reasonably confident. But again, I caveat all of that by saying we have to win our share in the third quarter and not lose more than our share in the third quarter and we're in the middle of that so... Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division : Any early signs on how that's going that you can comment on? Martin Mucci : I guess I would just say that we're feeling continued positive -- real positive momentum on the sales forces kind of across-the-board, whether it's core payroll, SurePayroll, 401(k), HR outsourcing, all feeling a good momentum there that has continued from the first quarter right into the second. Operator : The next comes from Sara Gubins, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : You mentioned seeing some more client growth in this past quarter. Is there a sense that this is coming from any improvement on the new business formation front? Or is it better sales in existing small businesses? Martin Mucci : I would say it's not very much from the new business. I would say that the negatives seem to be flattening out a little bit there where we were -- that was when we were down year-over-year on new business growth. So that seems to be flattening out. I'm not saying we're getting any wind behind us on new business growth yet, so I think that's still -- very slowly improving. It's more from, I think, some of the focus we've put on banking channels and -- for referrals and franchises and the CPA community. So that's where we're seeing more positive momentum from a sales perspective. Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Great. And then separately, I was hoping to learn a bit more about the relationship with Kashoo. And could you give us any color of your ownership of it and whether or not you see a pathway to total ownership? And then also you mentioned that you thought it could help strengthen the relationship with CPAs. I was trying to understand that a bit better because it looks like maybe it could be a competing product with them? Martin Mucci : Yes, we see it as an alternative -- let me take the last part first. That from a CPA perspective, I think what we got from research we had that they're constantly looking for alternatives to what they have today. And that if a client -- this is a simple accounting -- cloud accounting package that can help a business, a brand-new business, maybe get started. But as they build and get larger, they would move toward a CPA, and the CPAs can very easily work on the same Kashoo work on their accounting package with the client, which, of course, they like. So we're trying to do it, always encouraging the client who gets on the product to use their CPA, do the work in conjunction with their CPA because that's still an important relationship for us. So we think that the CPA, one, is looking for other choices and accounting packages, and especially for a brand-new business that's starting up, this might be a way to start them then they realize that they could go to an accountant and help them either with Kashoo's package, our package, or move to something else. I would say from the relation-- the investment standpoint, we made an investment into the company, a minority investment. And there's -- I think there's always an opportunity for future increase in investment. But right now, we're pleased with having an investment in them, having a white label product under Paychex Accounting Online that we offer, and see how it goes from here. Operator : The next comes from Jim MacDonald, First Analysis. James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : Back to the ACA impact. What about the impact on your health brokered business, given the taxes that the ACA puts into place. Is that going to slow that growth? Martin Mucci : Well, we're thinking, generally -- first of all, the opportunity is for us to get in front of clients and explain what all the requirements are and that we have some products that will help them. Second, I think we're always impact -- we're always thinking that if small businesses move more to the shops, to the exchanges, that could hurt us a little bit, that would be a negative for us because some of the small business would move to the exchanges. But again, right now, we're not seeing much of that because the exchanges are not really in very good shape and they're not necessarily set up, and the rates aren't necessarily that much better than what we can offer through various carriers and so forth. So I think in the longer term, if they get up and running and get efficient and have competitive rates, it could hurt us a little on the small end. However, we had started to focus already on a little bit more of our mid-market or larger-market clients with insurance. We have covered the gamut, but we have focused the expansion teams, the increase in salespeople, on the 50-plus market and that won't impact. If anything, that will drive more sales, I think, to us because we can give a very competitive offering. And remember that our offering helps integrate with payroll, it provides additional information. We help with the billing and we help you set up a client -- I'm sorry, a new employee and we also help you with COBRA. So I think there could be some -- there's some negative piece to it that we've talked about on the small end, but there's some positive piece I think on the mid-market in which we're also selling insurance in. Efrain Rivera : And Jim, I think that everyone's feeling the fact that the ACA's tacking on some additional fees that clients have. So I don't think anyone's disadvantaged or advantaged in that process. We -- as Marty said, we knew the lower end of the market eventually will gravitate into an exchange that probably at the margin makes that a little bit more quick to happen. But they're -- but we've pivoted our sales force to address that, to position ourselves for that anyway. James R. MacDonald - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division : Okay. And the G&A this quarter seemed to be up a bit more than I would have expected. Any issues there? Efrain Rivera : No. There's no issues whatsoever other than good ones. So -- the first is our IT spending was about where we expected it. We expected it to be a little bit higher in the first half of the year. It was up. And then the other part was we're just having a very strong selling season. We typically wouldn't call that out unless it was a bit above where we expected it to be and we just have to make provisions on the assumption that, that will continue throughout the year. So if we don't call it out, it's because it's about where we expected it. And as Marty's been saying now for 2 quarters, sales execution's been really strong. So those are the 2 buckets where it increased. Operator : The next comes from Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Calling in for Smitti. I was hoping you guys could just help us quantify the Hurricane Sandy impact. I think last year you mentioned maybe a negative 50 bp impact to payroll revenue. So would you say that the benefit this quarter has been approximately the opposite of 50 bp benefit positive impact? Efrain Rivera : Yes, I'd say it's 50 bps. That's our best estimate. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Okay. And then heading into the year, you guys gave guidance around expecting EPS to being evenly split from the first half to the second half. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : So I guess now that you've had this strong first half, are you guys still expecting that same distribution? Efrain Rivera : No, not quite. I think we're obviously a little bit ahead in the first half and we reiterated where we are in our EPS guidance for the year as I read it out. So we're still in the 8% to 9% range. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : Got it. And then maybe if we could just revisit buyback. So you guys had that authorization last year and then share count was ticking up. And now it's the second quarter in a row where you've done the buybacks. I'm wondering if there's anything in your thinking that's changed and whether you expect to continue this going forward? Efrain Rivera : Look, I think that what we have done through the first 2 quarters is buy back opportunistically, primarily to offset dilution. Some quarters, we're a little bit more successful than others. And we'll do that through the balance of the year. Got no specific program purchases per se, but we'll look at opportunities to offset some of the dilution. We've had a pretty significant dilution over the last -- by our standards, over the last year or so, 18 months, and we're just trying to offset a bit of that. Operator : The next comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar, Citibank. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I guess I wanted to go back to the product road map, the comments on IT spending. If you could give us an update on key initiatives that you have coming up? And also remind us how much of the spend on all these multichannels in the recent past, how do you think of it in terms of onetime spend versus something you had to keep doing on an ongoing basis, what's the split there? Martin Mucci : I think there's always going to be a consistent -- some level of consistent spend there. I think we had been on a higher end of some of the spend now. But as you capitalize it and amortize that, obviously, that takes over for some of the expense you had. So you end up with more expense on depreciation and the amortization of capitalized software and so forth. I think we're at a pretty steady rate. I think we had reached our peak kind of over the last year or so. And I think it will stay steady. I don't think it's going to go down a lot, but I don't -- you won't see it going up as much as it had. It was the only expense that has grown double digits over the last 4 or 5 years. And I think it'll stay relative low double digit or below kind of growth in the future. And so I don't know. There's some onetime, but I think there's a constant level of spend and it's just a matter of setting your priorities on where you spend most. The focus will continue to be on integration of all the products. You have a wide suite of products and so it'll be on integration, certainly continue to be on mobility. Although we feel very good where we are now with the mobility product being able to get it basically any of your information as an employer or an employee and being able to submit or edit payroll as well. So I think it's mobility. It's integration. And certainly, it's always about making it easy, so from a user interface standpoint, how do you continue to keep up with the trends of making things very easy and client-friendly to get at their information, when they want it and how they want it and do what they want. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : That's useful. So just to clarify, though, steady in -- you said steady in the low double digit. Were you referring to growth, in which case it would keep growing faster than revenues? Or are you saying steady as... Efrain Rivera : Yes, yes, Ashwin. So the answer is we expect it to grow faster than revenue, but we expect other areas, obviously, ops -- operation expenses and G&A to offset part of that increase. The price of being in this game is to constantly spend in technology. And the game we're in increasingly is creating a suite of services that becomes the point that gets sticky for the customer. So payroll alone is not the only thing that many customer want. They want an integrated solution. So what you've got to do is invest in creating the technology, which Marty was just mentioning, to deliver that information in mobile fashion and give them access across all platforms to that information. So we anticipate that spending on IT will tend to grow at a faster rate than sales whereas spending on ops will grow at a slower rate. Martin Mucci : Yes, I think it'll be a continuation of what you've seen, even as when IT spend, we've mentioned this was probably more mid- to high single-digit increases -- growth increases, we always offset that. And so when we look at total expenses, we're always looking for some leverage in most everything we're doing, but that's in total. So where you drive productivity in one side, the technology spend will tend to be the higher end of the expenses. Efrain Rivera : Yes, Marty was saying mid- to higher teens. So yes, 15% to 20%, which was our peak. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Understood. That detail is quite useful. The -- I guess, one other question I had was more of a clarification again. The payroll client count, that's the overall number, does include SurePayroll, right? Efrain Rivera : Yes, it does. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : And that part is increasing nicely and you're saying it's really the core is still sluggish. Efrain Rivera : I didn't say any of that, but Sure is increasing nicely and overall we're increasing. We've increased in the first half of the year. But a caveat, for the third time, we need to get through the sales season to see where we end up. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Right, right. Is there any early intel in terms of competitive dynamics with regards to the selling season [indiscernible] Martin Mucci : No, I think it's a little too early for that, but we don't see, at least at this point, we don't see the environment any different, any more or any less competitive, than we have in the past. So it's a little bit early but we don't really -- haven't really seen much change in the competitive environment. If anything, I think we're feeling good about the progress we're making at this stage. Operator : The next question comes from Joseph Foresi, Janney Montgomery Scott. Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : So my first question here is just on -- I'm just trying to frame the demand environment. I know we've had a couple of years here where we're kind of slogging it out. But is this still currently a -- sort of a market share game? In other words, is it displacement and cross-selling just for the fact that the small business growth has been kind of mediocre? Efrain Rivera : I think -- let me characterize it this way. So 2 answers to that, Joe. The first is I think there's a couple of glimmers that indicate that the market itself is growing a little bit. It's still early but we've got some data points that suggest it's getting better. So I don't think it's purely a market share game, but I think it's still primarily one. So that's the first part of it. But I think the second part of it, the second way to answer that is that, increasingly, what we have seen over the last year is that when you go in to talk to a client, they want an integrated solution and they want integrated access to the data. So over time, what we believe is that the person -- or I should say the company that can provide that suite of services the best will win in the marketplace. And not just payroll, payroll is important, but it's also payroll and integrated data also. And that's where we had really gotten much, much better in our sales execution efforts, both on HRS, core and mid-market. And so I guess that's the way I'd frame the market and the opportunity. Martin Mucci : But I'd say -- just as Efrain said, there's some glimmer. I'd still say it's -- you could call it -- we could -- we would call it sluggish, but it's still -- there is some glimmer of some formation. And housing, I think, is still the one, as we've mentioned a few times, that looks like it's coming back in certain areas, and the housing gives us jobs all around that. So you're start -- as the inventories come down, new homes are going up. Prices are going up a little bit. Interest rates will be interest -- will be interesting on that. But it doesn't look like they're going to go up quickly or anything that would cause that to stall out, so. Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Okay. I mean, just to be clear, so we're not trying to extrapolate because I think people have asked you for data points on the selling season throughout the call. The glimmers you're talking about are more what you see on the macro side, not necessarily anything you're picking up on the selling season? Martin Mucci : That's correct. Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : I figured I help you guys on that one. One last one for me. It -- and it's a very kind of tough one. But if you had to kind of break up your selling into displacement versus cross-selling versus kind of new business or selling into existing accounts, I'm not asking for percentages, but where does that scale weigh right now? I mean, how much of this new business is displacement? How much of it is cross-selling? How much is new business? And you can just rank them. You don't have to give any kind of particular percentage. Efrain Rivera : Yes. So I guess you really have to look at it by segments, Joe. Primarily what we're doing on the HRS, not exclusively, but HRS is selling into the base. So you can say it's cross-selling or up-selling or whatever you want to call it, right? On the core payroll side, traditionally, 50% of our sales are in new businesses. So that's the new. And then the remainder are -- we're in a competition with everyone else in the market. So if you weigh all of that, a lot of it's cross-selling and up-selling for which we have a large opportunity within the base. And then in core, it breaks out kind of half and half. Operator : The next comes from David Togut, Evercore. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Marty, a couple of times, you've mentioned improved sales execution over the last couple of quarters. Can you bracket for us what bookings growth has been over the last couple quarters and compare it to what you saw in the previous fiscal year? Martin Mucci : Well, think I would just -- I guess I wouldn't -- we don't necessarily give a percentage. But I would just say that it is certainly positive across-the-board over last year. It was in first quarter, and it is in second quarter. And so across-the-board, what they're doing is, and Efrain kind of just went through this in a sense of we're selling better into the base for the HRS products, 401(k), ASO and PEO. We're selling, I think, better in the additional products that we've brought on, and certainly, the ancillaries of time and attendance and HR administration into the mid market. So I would just say that it's -- I don't want to be overly enthusiastic, but we're feeling really good progress on how sales is performing kind of across-the-board. SurePayroll is very strong. And so when you look at kind of payroll, HRS, SurePayroll across-the-board, all of them are doing better. So -- and I think that's better execution. I think we've focused a lot better in things that we've gone after, and we've executed well on that. And I think that's probably the best I can give you. We don't necessarily go into percentages, but I think it's been positive and it's been consistent. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Without going into exact percentages, can you bracket for us whether growth is in the single digits or the double digits? Efrain Rivera : It's good, David. We won't go any farther than that. Martin Mucci : Yes, especially before selling season. I would wait. Efrain Rivera : And it's been strong. So I'll just say that. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up. You highlighted the launch of Paychex Accounting Online. What was the date of the launch of that product? And can you quantify for us some of the sales you've seen from that product, client traction? Martin Mucci : Yes, it's been very early. We just launched it within the last -- about 30 days ago. And so it's been a lot of interest. It's -- you sign up over the web. And we do have a team to support those sales and so forth, but it's basically sold right now over the web. And we're getting a lot of good interest in it. It's done by search more than anything and then some advertising, and we're just getting started. But I think what you're finding is it's a very competitive space right now, very interesting space, that you'll see a lot of players in that. And it's something we thought, as we've researched it the last couple of years, that it was a good thing to get into, and we thought Kashoo had a very strong product in a simple cloud accounting app basis. So we're just getting started, but we're getting a lot of good interest in it. And we think it'll help also lead, obviously, to payroll sales and integration in payroll sales, both the SurePayroll and core Paychex payroll as well. David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division : Final question for me. As we look out to the next fiscal year, how are you thinking about your dividend payout ratio versus share repurchase in terms of overall capital allocation priorities? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I think, David, our position is that we'll first look at dividend increases before we look at share repurchases. But we'll have some element in the mix of share repurchase, at least to offset dilution. That's our thinking going forward. Martin Mucci : But you -- and you could see that we're -- we've been pretty consistent on where we are from a dividend payout ratio. And I would expect -- it's a board decision, but I would expect that, that would remain pretty consistent. Operator : The next comes from Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : I want to just ask on HRS services. Obviously, you increased the guidance there for that range. What's causing the surprise or where's the strength actually coming from better than your expectations? Martin Mucci : I think it's across-the-board. 401(k) has been very strong. We went after expanding -- about 1.5 years ago, expanding our kind what we call large market, going after a little bit larger 401(k)s than we had in the past and in our base, and that's been very successful. And I think -- so 401(k) across-the-board has done very well in their growth. And then on the ASO and PEO side, we talked a little bit earlier why the PEO, I think, is certainly getting a bump from health care reform, and that's helping. But I think we also are executing a lot better in our PEO business. We put some new -- there's some new folks in there, some new plans and leadership and over the last couple of years, and that's really starting to pick back up and do well. And so I think with all the insurance confusion that's out there, I think people have been much more open to go toward the PEO, and that's helped us. And the ASO, I just think there's more and more regulations. I think as the economy gets slightly better, businesses are willing to spend a little bit more and also see the value of that product and how much you can -- it can help you with all the compliance and so forth that we offer. And we've been in it a long time. So I think it's just kind of -- it's all kind of coming together to hit our stride between execution and the environment. Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And then just on payroll services. Obviously, the growth rate was a little faster than, I think, our and Street expectations. Thinking about that longer-term, what's the right growth rate? Is 3% to 4% the right growth rate on a longer-term basis, or due to a little bit of client growth, little bit of pricing, we can actually see that more -- a higher number than that as we go forward? Efrain Rivera : I think, Bryan, we need to kind of work through the remainder of the year. But I would just say, our internal expectation is that 3% to 4% is not a number we want to be at, and we think that there are probably a number of ways to get that above that. That's our guidance for the year. We'll walk through it and get a better sense. We've been feeling our way through this, coming off a year where we had just barely 2% for a number of reasons. We're really pleased with the acceleration, and we think -- we want to get it above 3% to 4%, put it that way. Operator : The next comes from Kartik Mehta, Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : And so, Marty and Efrain, I wanted to ask you a little bit about the SurePayroll business. And if you are seeing any more competition or more pricing competition? It seems like lots of cloud players out there, or people who want to be cloud players, wanting to get into the payroll business. And has that resulted in any more pricing competition? Martin Mucci : I think you're -- specifically, Kartik, I missed that first part. It was on SurePayrolls, right? Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : Yes. Martin Mucci : Yes. I -- there have been some more players that you hear of, that start up I -- but right now, they're doing very well. They've continued to have great sales growth, and we're not seeing a lot of change in the -- from a pricing per unit standpoint at all. I -- they've been very effective in selling a lot of their -- it's web search and then they complete the sale over the phone, and they've done a good job. So we really haven't seen an impact on the pricing there. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : And then Marty, on the Kashoo business. Any thoughts about changing the price you charge for customers for that business model to try to gain some market share? And then is there a need for more investment in that business, to add any modules or other services that you think would give you a competitive advantage? Martin Mucci : Well, on the pricing, I think it's pretty competitive right now. We're -- it's in that $25 to $30 range per month, and there are certain various promotions that go on. I -- so I think that's pretty competitive, very competitive with what's out there. And I think you're right. On the long term, we do see this as a growth opportunity for us. We've done everything around payroll. We've hooked almost every service around payroll and, I think, have down well and continuing to drive up the penetration of those products, 401(k), workers' comp, insurance, et cetera. When you kind of back up in that whole system of offerings and you look at accounting, now you've got a lot of other offerings that you could come off of that and begin to offer and expand, increased that penetration. Right now, we're just trying to build this base. We're at the stage of just getting started and saying, one, can we help clients get started with this; can we link them to payroll; can we build that client base? And then once the base is building at a good rate, then look to what you can add to it. But there's certainly some opportunities that we are continuing to look at to do that. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : So, Marty, will this just be sold over the Internet or will your payroll salespeople also sell it to accountants and you'll use that distribution channel as well? Martin Mucci : Well, right now, it's going to be over the Internet, given the cost of the service and so forth. Plus, I think that, that seems to be the most effective way to get it, because you're getting brand-new businesses just as they're getting started. And so I think selling over the Internet, we're going to try that first. We're going to trial probably some telesales type of effort as well on that and direct call-in and so forth, and we'll try various ways. But right now, it's going to be mostly web-based search and then sell it all over the phone. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : And then just one last question, Efrain. Any thoughts on changing strategies for the float to maybe increase the yield on the portfolio, or do you stay where you are? It seems like we're going to have short -- pretty low rates for a while -- for some time now. Efrain Rivera : I'd characterize it as a tweak. The -- yes, so I read what Bernanke said. And the notes I saw, post-call, were that they thought that short-term interest rates might increase by 25 bps by next summer. That's -- that wasn't sort of our thinking going into the call, but that's where he's -- what he's signaling. If you're in that environment, I would say there's a tweak to say go longer. So we'll look at that as we go through the year. Operator : Next is Jeff Silber, BMO Capital Markets. Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Just to continue the discussion on your interest on funds line. If I remember, at the beginning of the year, you talked about that line item being down. I think it was about 7% to 9%. Year-to-date, it's running roughly flat. You didn't change your guidance for the back half of the year. Is there something going on in the back half of the year that we need to be aware of, or do you think you're just being conservative? Efrain Rivera : I think we're being a little bit conservative, Jeff. I will say this that the recent Fed pronouncements are literally a day old, so it's a little bit tough to incorporate all of that thinking into our back half. We don't expect material improvement because our -- we only replaced about 15% to 20% of the portfolio, so we've made a lot of those decisions already, so may not see a lot of the upside or, I should say, sounds like a lot of upside, but any modest upside during the remainder of the year. We'll look at the portfolio. And if there's any changes, we'll update next quarter. I think it really is more kind of what next year looks like. That's what the recent decisions will cause us to revisit. Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, great. And on the fund balances side, I know at the beginning of calendar year 2013, you had mentioned you had an influx of funds because of an increasing withholding. Is there anything going on at the beginning of calendar year '14? Efrain Rivera : No, don't anticipate anything. So we're up 6% year-to-date. It's really just going to depend on client balances and number of clients in funds, so no structural changes. I'll call it expected. Operator : Next comes from David Grossman, Stifel. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : I'm wondering if we could go back to the HRS business. And could you just maybe help us better understand, at least in your own view, what the relative maturity of each of these different segments are that reside in that disclosure and, perhaps, the relative scale of each of those businesses. Martin Mucci : Well, I think there's still a lot of room. The highest penetrated product would be 401(k), and that still has a lot of room. And we don't actually give out the product penetration anymore, but that would be the highest penetrated. And yet, still, we have a number of clients in our payroll base that do not have our 401(k) and give us a great opportunity there, but have a 401(k) but not with us. And so I think that's probably the highest penetrated. All of them, I think we've said, are certainly well under 20% penetrated into the payroll base, and the newer products, when I would say \"newer\" like insurance, health insurance are way down into single digits and offer us an awful lot of opportunity. So we spent an awful lot of time as an executive team, David, just looking and saying, there's a lot of room here for -- there's a lot of opportunity here for product penetration, and we try to find ways to continue to grow that. 401(k) was a great example. We went after larger market conversions early. And for 401(k), for many, many years actually, we just took brand-new plans. And so there's just a lot of opportunity in all of it. It's -- I think gives us a lot of runway for years ahead. Efrain Rivera : Look -- and the fact that we don't specifically call it out, Marty saying, doesn't mean that we don't understand what the opportunity is. It's just that the opportunity is really large. And every quarter we go, we discover that there's other opportunities that we should be directing our attention to. And I think the 401(k) upmarket is a great example of an opportunity that -- an organic opportunity in the last year to 18 months that doesn't depend at all on our client base. Those are not current Paychex clients for payroll. They simply are new clients that we are adding because we have acquired a core competency that was adjacent to our -- that are adjacent to our initial core competency, which was doing payroll and 401(k) plans. So when we look at the opportunities in each of those segments, be it ASO, PEO, be it 401(k) or insurance, we just see a lot of runway before we ever would get to a point where there're -- where we saw we were saturating the client base. And I think the other thing, David, I would add is, that we've said this several times, that we really have a big advantage because of our client base and the fact that we see the market gradually moving towards a suite of services sale. And it's the best suite of services with the best integrated data that, over time, integrated access to the data that's going to win, especially in small and medium-sized businesses. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Right. So with that said, it probably takes 2 things, right? One is having a product set that is kind of truly integrated and meets those criteria. And then secondly, a sales force that can sell a bundle, which I think is a slightly different sale. So can you help us perhaps -- you can leave the technology piece out. I know you've talked a lot about that in the past. But on the go-to-market sales side, what have you done to tweak that sales organization to sell that bundle since it is really a different approach? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think, one, we've -- it's still -- to start with, most of the time, it's still going after the base and coming in behind it. And what we've done there is get much more specific on what each group is selling. So again, the 401(k) market was -- we had a lot of folks in 401(k) sales very good at selling brand-new plans, first time I ever had a 401(k), et cetera. Then we went more to kind of smaller but still conversions. Now we go to larger market conversions, it requires a different tenure, I think -- I guess I'd say of talent in the sales organization to sell a large market plan. And we also sell much more into financial advisors. So we'll go to a financial advisor who we would normally sell a plan to the client and then say you need a financial advisor and here's one you could talk to. Now we're building more relationships with the financial advisors, and there's an opportunity there to pick up even more business from the advisor, not just per client but maybe by advisor. So it's to us, for the most, it's changing some strategies to get much more specific on what you're trying to sell, and then look for the -- a different skill also, to some degree and experience. And we've been very successful on that, I think, is the biggest part. Then you'll see probably more of a shift of as we look at a client that comes in that might have more employees, that you go at that client with a full bundle. We're doing a little bit more of that now as opposed to just our traditional model of sell payroll and then sell everything else after on a kind of 30-day, 60-day, 90-day type of thing. So I think we're trialing a lot of different ways to sell it, to increase that opportunity. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : And do you have any data points on the bundled sale? Martin Mucci : No. I'd say it's still fairly early on that to say it. But I think the data point is when you're seeing the growth in HRS continue at double digits and 12% and numbers like that, it's showing continued great momentum. Because the client base isn't growing as quickly, obviously, over the last few years because of the economy, yet that HRS continues to drive into that product, into that base. I think that's the best data point I'd give you is that we're still seeing really solid growth there and bringing guidance up a little bit because of the execution. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Right. Okay. And then just secondly, just going back to the rates. I mean, Efrain, when you look at the forward yield curves, any sense of when the rate comparison actually should go positive? I mean, should we see that? I assume -- you're obviously taking out the total return with the balance growth. But just the yield itself, should we see that turn positive then -- next year? Efrain Rivera : Yes. You should see it turn positive next year. I can't give you numbers yet. We'll have to analyze what rolls off the portfolio, but we should go positive next year. Operator : The next comes from Tim McHugh, William Blair. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : First, just on the PEO business. I guess how's the competition as you're growing that? Is there anything -- is it, I guess, significant, or do you feel like you've pulled ahead and that's part of the growth you're seeing? I guess just a little more color on what you're seeing there, given the growth you reported. Martin Mucci : Yes. I think -- no, I think that the competition, the competitive environment is probably as strong as it's ever been because there's been some consolidations over the last few years, and I think they've -- therefore, I think the competition is pretty strong. I do think that we've executed much better, as I said earlier. I think we've got a better focus. I think we've got a great product. We've also -- we improved the technology and the product there with probably 18 months ago or so and got a stronger product set. And so between the product set, the leadership and the execution and the last thing I was -- and the market, this -- the whole health care reform environment, I think all of those have led to us doing better in the market overall. So I think the market -- I think the whole PEO market is positive to begin with. But I also think between product technology and execution on sales and operations, we've done a lot better. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Is the bulk of the sales and -- the reason people are buying in the PEO, is it because the health care uncertainty and, I guess, the cost of health care? Or is it out to the kind of a holistic outsourced solution? I guess where -- I think of those as the 2 main reasons people might buy some of those. Where does it sit right now? Martin Mucci : I think it's a little bit of both. I think, obviously, we sell it as -- there's a total outsourced solution, that we're giving you support from an HR perspective. And I think that the insurance side adds a strong additive to that. You start with the HR. But I think the fact that, right now, in particular, with so much concern and confusion over health care, I think that's kind of throwing -- it's kind of throwing people on the value set overboard to make the decision to go with it. So I think it's a combination. But I think, certainly, the health care confusion is helping a lot, drive you to the PEO versus an ASO. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division : Okay. And then on the topic of exchanges got brought up on kind of on an ancillary basis a little bit on the call. I guess what's your outlook there? I believe you've launched your own kind of exchange solution for small businesses. What type of interest from clients? And is that an opportunity to grow the insurance brokerage business more quickly, or is that a threat as you look forward, I guess? Martin Mucci : Well, I think it's -- on one side, it's going to be -- it's a little bit of both. On one side, it's the threat as we talked about on the small business side. I think at the exchanges, you assume, over the next year, they'll get in better shape and they'll offer competitive rates. I think that they will draw some small businesses to them. And I think that -- but I think, on our side, the partnership we did was actually more toward -- around the benefit card that we offer that allows you to combine flexible spending accounts and health savings accounts and reimbursements accounts altogether, because that's a big confusion point for our clients and their employees, and tying that then to a private exchange partner of ours. Right now, there's some confusion out there now because there's -- but with some changes in the flexible spending account rules as to whether you could do tax deferred or tax -- yes, I guess I'd say tax deductible, really, kind of payments into these plans. And that's -- so those rules are kind of changing right now, and we're trying to work through that. But generally, I'd say the exchanges are going to be a little bit of a negative for us. But overall, because of the way we'll partner, I think it'll be positive or a nonevent in the long run. Operator : The next comes from Mark Marcon, R.W. Baird. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Just wondering, with regards to the strength that you're seeing on the core, could you talk a little bit about where you're seeing that specifically in terms of really small end? I'm talking about sub-7s versus your traditional core versus MMS. Efrain Rivera : Mark, there really isn't a significant change from prior quarters. We were -- we've seen strength basically across all of the segments that we competed in payroll. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Any regional differences? Martin Mucci : Not -- I would say a little bit. We're -- I think southeast and west, I think where the housing, that's helping a little bit, give us a little strength there as the housing is coming back a little bit there, the new home construction and so forth. But that's helping on the new business side. But other than that, not a big difference. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then as it relates to the integrated and bundled solutions, can you talk about the new clients that you're getting? Like is there a greater percentage that are utilizing or buying upfront a bundled solution, or is it pretty much the same? Martin Mucci : I'd say it's pretty much the same at this point. I don't think you're -- I think with the economy the way it is, even though our selling is moving more toward that, you're still seeing people be a little bit cautious and maybe buying in over time additional products. It's still been -- it's still we're seeing, generally, you buy something, you build some confidence with them and then you can sell on to the next -- the value of the next product and so forth. Now with some clients you can go in right upfront and say, \"Look, I can sell you an ASO offering because you're a client that has a lot of turnover.\" You're a restaurant or a service organization that has a lot of turnover. You have a lot of issues with whether employees are exempt or non-exempt. It depends on the client. But generally, I don't think it's changed too much yet, overall. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Great. And then with regards to the pickup are -- how much of it -- of that would you attribute to the improved product relative to improvements in sales, both in terms of leadership and training? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think it's a little bit of both, I think, certainly, we've had great execution and leadership. I think there's a lot of new leadership in the team. I think they're doing very well, and they're continuing to drive, I think, a real accountability and commitment. We've always had that, but I think it drives it even more. And they're giving them a lot of support in the field. But I also think, certainly, the product having service satisfaction numbers at an all-time high and continue to be there, our operation teams, that really gives them a value to sell and then you get more referrals that way. And certainly, the technology, the mobility platform, we're just seeing an increasingly number of clients that are using the mobility platform, their employees and the clients, whether they're gaining -- getting information, getting their pay stubs. And all of that starts to give you not only better value for referral to sell, but also it improves the retention as well. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And you said that the client satisfaction is at all-time high, and you also mentioned that -- earlier that retention is near record levels. Could you give us a specific number in terms of the retention? Martin Mucci : I think we said on the retention, it was -- at our highest levels, it was over 81. It was over 81, which would be our highest -- I think that's the last number we gave out. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, great. And then are you also benefiting from a reduced number of companies going out of business just because... Martin Mucci : Absolutely, but that's flattening out now. That was a big improvement over the last couple of years. And now, that's not as much the issue anymore, that -- we're not gaining as much on that. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : So relative to a year ago, that's probably about the same? Martin Mucci : Yes. Well, even a little less. Like improvement from those going out of business is certainly less improvement, I guess I'd say, than last year. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then with regards to -- just to wrap up on one thing I wasn't certain on. The -- just sequentially, going from Q1 to Q2, you had the exact same number of processing days in Q1 as Q2? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay, great. And then finally, as we think about the tech spend, what are the areas that you think you need to improve further? How should we think about that and kind of the roadmap going forward? Like where do you think the biggest opportunities are? Martin Mucci : I think it's always -- to me, it's always integration of all your products, making it easier to integrate. It's -- we've introduced, in the mid-market space, some kind of the integrated solution of people, for example, a place where it's just easier from any -- whether you're in time and attendance, HR administration or payroll, that you can easily pull an icon down for people and make all your changes very quickly, kind of in a pop-up screen, and then it'll fill in all 3 of those services. It's always going to be about making though -- whatever the client needs easier and more integrated across the multitude of products that we have. So integration of products, ease of use, user interface and mobility will be our continued focus. And then, of course, as we acquire or do things like Kashoo, it'll be how do we integrate those more and more into our product set, so anything we buy and expand, how do we integrate those more into our product set as well. We'd like any client to take full product suite, obviously, and make it very easy for them to move between products and look at the experience as one total product. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : What percentage of the clients are on the platforms that would enable that easy integration? Efrain Rivera : The vast majority. Martin Mucci : Yes. Efrain Rivera : The vast majority, Mark. Martin Mucci : Yes. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. And then last question, just with regards to the new sales on the core. Of the 50% of the clients that aren't brand-new businesses, they're obviously doing something from a payroll perspective. Has there been any shift in terms of who you're taking clients from? It would seem that just as the technology investment goes up, it makes it more and more difficult for some of the locals to keep up. Martin Mucci : Yes. We've seen that pretty consistently that more local players -- but -- and I think we've done about the same as we always have with the other national competitor, maybe a little better lately, but that's pretty close. They take some and -- from us, and we take some from them. And -- but the regional players, it's more difficult for them to have the product suite, the breadth of products, as well as the technology and the mobility platform, which is becoming so much more popular now. Operator : Then the last question today comes from Tien-tsin Huang, JPMorgan. Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Just a few quick questions, I hope, just the acquisition side. I heard the dollar questions. But how's the performance of some of these acquisitions going? Are they like myStaffingPro? Are they performing above, below plan? Any kind of anecdotes there? Martin Mucci : Yes. I would say they're performing at or above where we expected. It's still fairly early, but we're -- not only from their organic standpoint, themselves, but also tying them into us. We're feeling pretty good. We're pretty careful. We look at a lot and acquire a few, and then we are very tight on the integration and the work and the execution work. We follow it very closely. So all of them are doing as well or better than the business cases that we put forth. Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : All right. Just a quick question, just around data, following up of the last question. Just -- have you seen any change in the way your clients are inputting their payroll data into the systems? Any shift there or interesting trends to call out? Martin Mucci : I would just say that I think -- the -- they're probably more online. But the interesting thing with us is we offer that dedicated payroll specialist to you. And this week, you may -- and we really encourage the fact that this week, we may call you -- the payroll specialist who's dedicated and knows your business will call you and get your information and work with you. The next week, you may want to do your own payroll online and then you may want call them with a question. The next week, you could do it on your mobile phone. So we are seeing more interest in online and -- but still with that dedicated specialist. So they don't -- they can do it but they have help whenever they need it, if they want to do it. But we're really at work to give them their freedom to do what they want, when they want, kind of where they want. And so we offer them that dedicated person, and yet, they have all the opportunity. So we've seen online usage and input increase a little bit. Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay, good to know. Last one, just the -- on just back to float. I caught the conservatism comments. But as we step into the next quarter or the following quarter, float balances, I guess, should come in a little bit, given some of that tax changes? Just trying to make sure -- or I guess, next quarter, any reason why it should step down sequentially? Efrain Rivera : No, it shouldn't. Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : It shouldn't, right? Efrain Rivera : Yes. But a caution, Tien-tsin, part of the mental calculation that I'm doing when I get asked that question, is how much of the 15% to 20% of the portfolio is rolling off in a given quarter. So that affects what my answer is going to be with respect to the -- with respect to where we see interest rates. So we've invested a lot of the funds that we expected to roll off at this point. We have a tranche coming in spring. And then the question is whether it really makes a dime's worth of difference for the projection for the remainder of the year. Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Got it. So the roll-off is the key. The float balance change shouldn't be that volatile. Efrain Rivera : No, no. That's right. Operator : There are no other questions, sir. Martin Mucci : Okay. At this point, we'll close the meeting. If you're interested in replaying the webcast, it will be available till approximately January 20. I thank you for the -- taking the time to participate in our second quarter press conference call and for your interest in Paychex, and we wish you all a very happy holiday season. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you.",

Operator : Welcome, and thank you for standing by. (Operator Instructions). Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Go ahead sir, you may begin. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex's third quarter fiscal 2014 results. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. Yesterday afternoon, after the market closed we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2014. We also filed our Form 10-Q, which provides additional discussion and analysis of the results for the quarter. These documents are available also by accessing our Investor Relations page at paychex.com and this teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month. On today's call I will share my thoughts on our results and update you on how we are doing in operations, sales and product development areas and Efrain will review our third quarter financial highlights and discuss our full year guidance. And then we'll open it up for your questions. We are pleased with our results in the third quarter. We continue to make progress driving new business revenue and selling more value added services and increasing revenue from our client base. We released additional enhancements to our online and mid-market products and in fact we\u2019ll be releasing the next version of our mobile app user interface this week. Along with these technology enhancements we remain focused on providing industry leading service to our clients and their employees. Efrain will go into more detail on the financial results and comparisons. However I would like to provide you with some highlights of the quarter. Total service revenue showed good growth of 7% for the quarter. Payroll service revenue growth of 5% was supported by solid results in the core payroll product. HRS revenue increased 12% in the third quarter as we continued to benefit from demand -- support from demand for human resource outsourcing solutions and strong execution highlighted particularly in the PEO business. Checks per payroll have improved for 16 consecutive quarters now, third quarter growth was 1% moderating a bit from the first half of the fiscal year. From a sales perspective we continue to experience good new business revenue growth particularly in core payroll and Paychex HR outsourcing solutions. Our execution in service operation s also continued to be excellent. The team did a great job for our clients with year-end processing including the distribution of our W2s and year-end reporting ahead of schedule. I also want to note that our business continuity plans have performed extremely well through severe winter conditions that many of our clients experienced, ensuring that our client needs our service even in the worst condition. This is probably one of the toughest winters that we've gone through from a service perspective and we've just done an excellent job particularly on the East Coast as went through a number of storms. I am proud of the partnership and the service commitment demonstrated by our employees that continued to result in client satisfaction and client retention results that remain at very high levels. This effort is really a testimony to the strength of our client service model, always putting our clients first. From a technology perspective continued investment in our SaaS solutions and mobility offerings positioned us for long-term growth. We have market-leading SaaS solutions, levering the latest technologies, our online HR, administration and time and attendance products are integrated with our Paychex next generation offering. We are experiencing increased demand for our SaaS solutions across our client base. We continue to invest significantly in our online capabilities as well as our mobile applications and whether you are a client or client employee our mobile app provides clean and efficient access to all of your own information with one to two clicks. We give clients the ability to start, edit and submit their payroll with the best mobility app in the marketplace. And as I mentioned we'll be introducing the latest version of the mobile offering this week. During the third quarter we officially initiated our operations in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil and enhanced our portfolio of value-added products and services with the official introduction of Paychex's payment processing services. This is a full suite of payment processing solutions, including credit and debit card processing, mobile and online payment services and point-of-sales solutions designed to meet the evolving needs of today's small businesses. This service is being offered in partnership with Elavon, a leading global payments provider. In the past few quarters I've talked about our new products designed to help our clients manage compliance requirements of the Affordable Care Act or more commonly known as Healthcare Reform. We continue to execute on the rollout of those product offerings in this area including our Paychex employer, shared responsibility service of more robust monitoring service in our Paychex benefit account. These products while new to the market represent an opportunity for us as we are uniquely positioned as both the payroll provider and insurance agency to help small businesses with these regulations. The frequent changes in ACA rules have caused some clients to delay decisions on purchasing products or making changes to their healthcare plans. However we continue to see healthcare reform as an opportunity for us as we are able to provide clients with the most up-to-date information on the latest requirements. We also continue our shareholder friendly actions. We increased our dividend back in July 6% to $0.35 per share and we continue to repurchase Paychex stock opportunistically and we have repurchased approximately five million shares of common stock in the first nine months of fiscal 2014. And finally last week we announced that on April 1, 2014 just next week in conjunction with IHS Inc. we will launch the Paychex IHS Small Business Jobs Index. This is a new monthly index that examines the state of small business employment in the U.S. by measuring aggregated small business payroll data from a subset of our small business client base. The index will identify and track small business employment trends and provide probably the most real timely accurate insight into national and regional employment activity as well as report on state and metro employment trends for many of the country's largest states and metropolitan markets. This index does not indicate Paychex financial results. In summary I am pleased with our results for the third quarter and I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employee team across all organizations from sales to service. And I will now turn over the call to Efrain Rivera to review the financial results in more detail. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Martin. I would like to remind everyone that during today's conference call we'll make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve risks. Refer to our press release for a discussion of forward-looking statements and related risk factors. As Marty indicated our third quarter financial results for fiscal 2014 represented good progress. There are a number of -- there are some of the key highlights for the quarter and nine months that I\u2019ll talk about now and I\u2019ll provide greater detail in several areas and wrap with a review of 2014 outlook. Total service revenue grew 7% for the third quarter and the nine months to $626 million and $1.8 billion respectively. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 3% for the third quarter and 1% for the nine months to $11 million and $31 million respectively. This result was due to lower average interest rate partially offset by an increase in average investment balances. Expenses increased 5% for both the third quarter and the nine months. The increase was mainly in compensation-related costs with higher wages and higher performance based comps. Wages were impacted by our investment in product development and supporting technology and new sales initiatives, implemented in fiscal 2013. For the nine months we also experienced higher sales-related costs attributable to new business revenue growth. We maintained strong operating margin of 38.4% for the third quarter and 39.7% for the nine months. Operating income, net of certain items, increased 12% for the third quarter and 9% for the nine months. We expect operating margin for the full year to be approximately 38%. Net income increased 11% to $169 million for the third quarter and 8% to $482 million for the nine month period. Diluted earnings per share increased 10% to $0.44 per share for the third quarter and 7% to $1.31 per share for the nine months. Turning to payroll service revenue, it increased 5% for the third quarter and 4% for the nine months. We benefited from increases in checks per payroll, revenue per client and client bases. As Marty already mentioned our checks per payroll growth metric continued to improve with the rate of growth moderating from earlier in the year. As we expected, checks per payroll increased 1% for the quarter and for the nine month period, 1.5%. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases, net of discount coupled with the impact of increased product penetration. The third quarter payroll revenue growth was bolstered by one additional payroll processing day in the quarter compared with the same period last year. The estimated impact on payroll revenue growth is in the range of 0.5% to 1%. Note that payroll revenue growth is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter due to one less payroll processing day compared to the prior year and we anticipate that payroll service revenue growth in the fourth quarter will be at the low end of the full year range. HRS, HRS revenue increased 12% for both third quarter and the nine months. We continued to experience rapid growth in both our ASO and PEO as well as in our online HR administration products. Interest revenue increase reflects client growth primarily in HR solutions, retirement services and online HR administration products. Our online HR administration products continued to grow due to success in sales of SaaS solutions. Within HR solutions the PEO continued to show strong growth in the number of clients we served. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in average asset value of participant funds. Insurance services revenue growth reflected higher premiums in workers' comp insurance services and an increase in the number of health and benefits applicants. HRS revenue growth was tempered modestly in the nine month period by higher direct cost in our PEO. Note that HRS revenue quarterly growth can vary due to the volume of client, PEO worker\u2019s compensation and basis points earned on retirement services client employee funds, basis points change in the fluctuations in the financial markets in the asset value fund invested. PEO net service revenue also exhibits greater variability between quarters due to a number of factors, including change in the worker\u2019s comp claims experienced. Turning to our investment portfolio, in the short term portfolio primary investment vehicles remain high quality variable rate demand note and bank demand deposit accounts. In the longer term portfolio we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.1 years. Our combined portfolio earned an average rate of return of 0.9% for the third quarter compared to 1% for the same period last year. For the nine months we earned 1% compared to 1.1% for the same period last year. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased during both the third quarter and the nine months due to growth in checks per payroll and the client base. For the nine months average balance benefited from the expiration of certain payroll tax cuts on December 31, 2012 which resulted in higher social security withholdings. Let\u2019s turn to the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong, cash and total corporate investments totaled $964 million as of February 28, 2014 and we had no debt. Funds held for clients as of February 28, 2014 were $4.9 billion compared to $4.1 billion as of May 31, 2013. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day to day basis and averaged $3.7 billion for the nine months, a year-over-year increase of 5%. Total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $39 million as of February 28, 2014 compared with net unrealized gains of $35 million as of May 31, 2013. Total shareholders\u2019 equity was $1.8 billion as of February 28, reflecting $383 million in dividends paid during the first nine months. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 34%. Cash flows from operations were $706 million for the first nine months, a 16% increase compared to the prior year. This increase was driven by higher net income, higher non-cash adjustments to net income, monthly higher amortization of premiums of available for sale securities along with higher depreciation and stock-based comp cost and changes in our operating assets and liabilities, related primarily to [time]. I would like to remind you that our outlook, turning to fiscal 2014 guidance for the remainder of the year is based on our current view of economic and interest conditions continuing with no significant changes. As I have mentioned the growth rate for payroll services revenue is expected to be at the low end of the full year range in the fourth quarter as a result of one less processing day compared to the same period last year. Our payroll service revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 3% to 4% for the full year and at the high end of that range. HRS revenue growth is also expected to be at the low end of the full year range for the fourth quarter for similar reasons and because we believe there will be a moderation in HR solutions performance. Overall HRS growth is expected to be in the range of 10% to 11% for the full year. Total service revenue is anticipated to be in the range of previous guidance although at the high end of that range. Net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 9% to 10%, adjusted up slightly from previous guidance. I remind you that in the fourth quarter of last year we recognized an additional tax provision for the settlement of the state tax issue which impacted diluted earnings per share. Our operating margin for the year is anticipated to be approximately 38% and as I mentioned to many of you 38% can be anything up to 38.5% and we don't call it to the nearest half percent. This is slightly lower than the margin experienced in the first nine months of fiscal 2014 as our margins are historically lower in the second half of the fiscal year. Finally thanks to those of you who participated in our Investor Day survey. Based on survey\u2019s feedback we decided to move it later in fiscal year \u201915 and we\u2019ll provide further information as we finalize the detail. Thank you very much and let me turn it back over to Marty. Martin Mucci :  Thanks, Efrain. Operator we\u2019ll now open the meeting to questions. Operator :  Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.:  Hey, thank you, guys. I appreciate you taking the question. Can you just give us a sense, now that the key selling season is over how your sales force did relative to the quota that they had during the key selling season and are you still expecting to be -- or I should say where are you expecting to be in kind of your 1% to 3% target range for organic client growth this year, now that you did get through the key selling season I am guessing you got some better visibility on where you might land in that range? Martin Mucci :  Jason, it's Marty. We don't necessarily we don't give the client growth number for the end of the year as you know because we want to get through the whole year. But I would say on the sales execution and selling season, continued solid performance there, so particularly in the HRS side in core payroll and HR small business and in the HRS particularly in the PEO, as we have said in some comments, feel really strong and the PEO came in really strong in the year and I think that's healthcare reform. I think that's just real resurgence there and that's been good. But really overall very continued solid execution from a sales perspective. Efrain Rivera :  And Jason just to add to what Marty said we don't give the specifics but we feel very comfortable that we are within that range. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.: Okay, that's helpful. And I think in the past, over the last several quarters or so when you guys have asked -- have been asked where pricing is running in core payroll, and seems like you've indicated it's been closer to the lower end of that longer term 2% to 4% range that you have made at the Analyst Meeting, a couple of years ago. Was that the case again during this quarter? Efrain Rivera :  Yeah, we are still feeling good retention from a client base and from a revenue, I guess I would say capture perspective, feel good about holding the price increase that we did last year. And I would think we never really changed that range going forward and we wouldn't want to get any more specific than that coming up. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.: Okay, and then just last question I think you mentioned seeing good traction on the SaaS side of the business. Can you give us any sense just in terms of mix of new sales how you've seen that shift, presumably the SaaS mix there has been increasing but any numbers you could give us just to help convey how much demand you've seen for SaaS, perhaps relative to the classic full service outsourced model? Martin Mucci : Yeah, it's an interesting mix. I will give you a comment then let Efrain pick up as well. But it's our model is we're giving over the last few years with all the technology investment and what we rolled out, we see a much bigger impact of clients moving to the online apps, but it's with our service tied into it. So what we like -- the way we positioned is was deliberately to say hey, you have a dedicated person there available to you but we have a much more robust online payroll time and attendance HR administration solutions for you as well. So if you want to do it online through the SaaS solution you can do that, if you want support and use your dedicated person you can do that. And what we're really starting to see is very much what we hope which was a mix of both using the solution and so many more online clients signing up for online but then using other service person as well, when they need to. So this week I may put in my own online payroll, I may call for something I need but I am putting it in myself, the next week I may go to the payroll specialist. What we're seeing, the biggest push online has continued to grow very much but the biggest push also had been in the time and attendance and HR solutions, the administration that our SaaS products online and we're seeing across both small and mid-market some growth in those products that's picking up in penetration and sales. So I wouldn't give exact numbers but we are certainly seeing a better penetration rate on the new sales; our attachment rate and a better penetration overall into the customer base. Efrain Rivera : Just to add to what Marty said when we say SaaS products we're talking about a suite of products that not only includes core payroll but includes things like timing, attendance, HR administration online, those are doing very, very well for us and they are both sold to our core base and also to -- in the mid-market space. With respect to the low end, the micro enterprise space, SaaS it's doing very well, it's continued to do well, that part of the market, the low end SaaS is very attractive to that portion of the market and so [payroll] translates very, very effectively there. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.: Okay, thank you guys for the color. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Go ahead sir your line is open. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : Hey good morning, Marty and Efrain. Martin Mucci : Good morning. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : Efrain, you said client growth, you don't want to give the client growth numbers but you are comfortable within the range you've set, is there a difference you are witnessing between may be the short payroll type of clients versus what I would consider your traditional Paychex type of client in terms of net client growth? Efrain Rivera : So we look at both and I think we are satisfied with the performance of both segments of the market. So I would say Kartik, the answer to your question is that we see growth on the low end and we've seen growth in our core client base also. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : And then Efrain, you had what I consider a very good margin quarter, seems like good growth year-over-year. Anything specific as why margins were really strong this quarter or is it that just one extra day and maybe just management of the expenses, was there anything else in terms of sales or sales execution or commission that might have impacted that? Efrain Rivera : I think Kartik that really, our model is -- has a significant component of variable expenses associated with it. And when we deliver strong top line growth the marginal expenses associated with that, that top line are relatively small and I think what you see in the model is that when we had strong revenue quarters like we did this quarter a lot of it flows to the bottom line and that\u2019s the way the model is built. So the more top line growth we deliver the better leverage we see. So I guess I'd characterize it that way. In other words we did everything we were thinking of doing in the quarter from an expense standpoint. There was nothing unusual about our spending pattern. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : And then just one last question Marty, have you seen any change or difference in terms of what\u2019s happening with your healthcare insurance business? I know at the beginning of the year you thought there might be some impact because of the Affordable Healthcare Act. I'm wondering because of all the changes that are happening or the delays that have been announced if that's impacted the business any differently than what you had anticipated? Martin Mucci :  Yeah, I think it certainly as moderated a bit. I think what we\u2019re finding, as I mentioned in the comments, Kartik was kind of a lack of decision making on some parts of the small business and really mid-size business because the rules keep changing and so I think the employers are not sure what to do exactly. So I think that it slowed a little bit from what we had expected or hoped for. The good news is the products are out there and the products that we rolled out giving the tools to the employer are really helpful. There is -- we\u2019re finding a lot of confusion from the small business and midsize business base and we\u2019re able to help them. So the good news is it's continuing to get us -- our reps in front of them with different products. I guess I\u2019d say the moderate news is that they are not buying as much insurance because they are not sure if now it's been pushed off a little bit and I think you might see that pickup more in toward into the summer and the fall as they look at benefit plans and start to see some, could be seeing healthy premium increases and they may look for alternatives from folks like our insurance agency, who can give them those tools. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Martin Mucci : All right, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim McHugh of William Blair & Company. Go ahead sir. Your line is open. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company: Hi, yes. Just wanted to ask you, you talked about seeing in the payroll growth, I guess better attach rates. Can you -- what is, I guess what solutions are included within the payroll services growth that you are attaching? And I guess the follow on, associated question also is, can we look at the revenue per client growth that\u2019s helping payroll growth partly reflecting that you are seeing, that your growth was in the mid-market necessarily than with smaller clients at this point or is that not a good conclusion to draw from the data? Martin Mucci : No, I\u2019ll start on the product and then let Efrain take that last part. I think Tim primarily what we\u2019re seeing is time and attendance solutions picking up and from a SaaS product standpoint anyway we\u2019re seeing time and attendance solutions that we would have felt were more mid-market are actually sliding down as well into the -- what we think of as the under 50, the small business market and that\u2019s been a nice pickup for us. So our time and attendance online solutions as well as some of the HR administration but mostly time and attendance are picking up into the small business. So they are showing up in the 20 to 50 where we were thinking they would be more seen in the 50 plus. Now we have a small end clock as well, when we purchased the Icon Time Systems, very basic clock, and that\u2019s the work in the under 10 but we\u2019re seeing even better pickup on the SaaS solution for time and attendance over 20, I would say. Efrain Rivera : Yeah, I would say, I don\u2019t think we can draw any conclusions on mid-market growth rates and I think that Tim what you see is a bit better client base, a bit better pricing, a bit better sales execution overall is really kind of driving what\u2019s going in payroll service revenue. In payroll service revenue we don't include the SaaS products that Marty just mentioned so time and attendance and HR online administration are reported in HR ad. So although we are attaching you are seeing some of the growth occurring on the HRS side. Now core payroll is I should say payroll is basically payroll services, tax pay, employee deposit which is executing better this year than we were last year. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company:  Okay and then I guess just given you had another SaaS based competitor become public, there\u2019s another one that\u2019s on file, that I guess just give us updated comments on the competitive environment as you see it from particularly in the I guess the small to mid-market right now. Martin Mucci :  Yeah, I don't see a lot of difference you know, whether they go public or not, you know obviously I don't think it changes a lot, it gives them a little bit of some name out there to get going public but we don't run into them too much -- we\u2019re still running into mostly the national competitor. They are not going to be able to offer as much from the service model perspective across the country, they are not going to offer quite as much from a technology perspective in its broader category from small to mid-size, I don't think as we do. So I think we\u2019re seeing kind of still the same level of competition and I think our investments from a technology standpoint combined with the service has been particularly strong right now. So I guess I would say for once Tim I am really glad that we invested where we did starting I would say four years ago when we really put a lot into the mobility app and the SaaS solutions because they are competing very well and it's positioned us nicely for the competition, that\u2019s coming up. But there is still more regional competitors from that standpoint. Efrain anything you want to add to that? Efrain Rivera : I would just say Tim that we know them very well, we know them in detail, we know their weaknesses and their strengths and we take all competition in this space seriously. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company: Okay, thanks. Operator :  Our next question comes from David Togut of Evercore. Go ahead. Your line is open. Martin Mucci : Hi, David. David Togut - Evercore Partners :  Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Martin Mucci :  Good morning. David Togut - Evercore Partners : Marty you mentioned some very recent enhancements in the mobile and SaaS product areas, can you perhaps lay out the broader new product roadmap over the next 12 to 18 months what we should expect from an innovation perspective from Paychex? Martin Mucci :  Yeah, I think the biggest thing is we have talked about it in the past, but I think we\u2019re seeing it come to fruition which is very much exactly what the clients want, which is an integrated experience for the way that we\u2019re delivering the entire product. So we started seeing a few years ago that really the mid-market and sometimes even the higher and small market is selling more to an HR or time and attendance need of the client and then payroll is part of that. And so what we worked on was enhancing products that we either purchased or built over the last four to seven years and then enhancing them to integrate the experience, put a revised look to them so that there is a combined, there\u2019s a single sign on, there\u2019s a combined UI -- the user experience and user interface for them. And you\u2019ll continue to see a more, I guess I\u2019ll say in that market you\u2019ll continue to see more integration and more UI and additional functionality that is more sophisticated and integrated like job costing and so forth that giving them everything and you are able to update, for example in the past we would have issues where you had -- you could update people's -- employees information in multiple places and sometimes that was confusing to the client. We now have one kind of people section that applies to the time and attendance HR in payroll and you can update in one place that updates everything and it\u2019s a much smoother seamless approach for the client and you\u2019ll continue to see that integration and usability improved and modernized. In mobility, like this week its making user interface even more modern and we just released this, the UI, I would say 12 to 18 months ago. Now we\u2019re releasing kind of an updated UI for the mobility platform. So the changes are going to be more frequent and they are just more modern as we see what the competitive market needs. David Togut - Evercore Partners : That makes sense. Just as a related question could you update us on the performance of some of your recent acquisitions and new products like ExpenseWire, myStaffing and Kashoo? Martin Mucci : Yeah, myStaffing, extremely strong performance from -- on organic -- they sell directly to clients as well and there is some indirect partners -- sellers there, indirect partnerships, that's selling very well and selling into our base as well. There is just a huge need for talent from applicant tracking through talent management and so forth and doing well. ExpenseWire is performing fine, that's from an expense management again integrating. We're pulling more and more those acquisitions into the overall mid-market products, so that there is more of a seamless integration along with our time and attendance and HR administration, so the client has a full suite. And then from Kashoo perspective on the Paychex's Accounting Online app very recent so we're getting good signups, we're getting a lot of attention. We're kind of learning how to drive more and more the, not only the sign up but then the adoption and actually registering and signing up the client. So we're working with Kashoo and then of course the private label version, our own is how do you drive -- we're doing pretty good driving activity in and then it's how do you get them to register in and sign up for the product. But it's very early, so we're kind of learning a lot in that market. But we're happy with -- we like the product and we're continuing to rollout with them additional enhancements to the Paychex accounting online. David Togut - Evercore Partners : On the topic of Kashoo, Intuit on its recent quarter reported 95% growth in their payroll processing business, are you seeing that the level of Kashoo, was that a little bit above or little bit below from a client size perspective? Martin Mucci : So you are saying they are seeing a big jump in their payroll processing service? David Togut - Evercore Partners : Right, I know they are targeted typically at very small businesses that may be below your average client size but I am just wondering if you see them at all in the market from a competitive standpoint. Martin Mucci : Okay. No, I think mostly what we'll see them, SurePayroll will see them and SurePayroll continues to perform very well. So that's the other acquisition that we would talk about it. Three years now we feel very good about SurePayroll continue to have good growth in more even in their direct channels and the indirect channels that they've done a lot of white labeling with banks and so forth. But even the direct channel's even stronger than we had expected. So we feel real good about their growth and their continued competitiveness against Intuit and others. David Togut - Evercore Partners : Just a quick final question, I thought in your comments about the strength in new business sales in the quarter, you called out every area as being strong except the mid-market. Do I have that correct or there was another message you are trying to send on mid-market payroll? Efrain Rivera : I think what we said there David was we just called out the one that were the strongest. We could have called out a number of different sales areas and we called out the ones that were strongest. David Togut - Evercore Partners : Okay. Thank you very much. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of RBC. Go ahead sir. Your line is open. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets : Hi, good morning. Martin Mucci : Hi Gary. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets : I think in the comments you said that for the nine months sales commissions was one of the drivers of growth but didn't specifically say that, that was a big driver of cost growth this quarter. Should we read into that a change in that the trending or growth of new business this quarter versus early in the year or am I reading too much into it? Efrain Rivera : I think you are reading too much into it. Actually sales expenses for the nine months are up with sales growth for the year. So I think you are reading a little bit too much into it. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets : Okay, all right. Efrain Rivera : And by the way, so as Marty said we continue to have very solid sales execution for the year and expect that to continue. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets : Yeah, okay. The next question you talked a lot about new product launches over the last few years and certainly all the product development investments you've been making, can you give us a sense, either numbers or sort of anecdotally how much of those efforts are to upgrade existing offerings that are going in and supporting the same revenue that you've been getting from customers versus driving incremental revenue through new sales or actually being a separate service? Martin Mucci : Yeah, I guess I would say certainly because when you look at the offering as a complete offering and we are seeing that more and more come down in the marketplace from people who wanted payroll years ago only and tax pay and direct deposit too, hey I would like something for my HR administration and time and attendance in particular, I think what you\u2019d see is the development has helped, it's both, it\u2019s shored up the existing product base but it\u2019s certainly getting more revenue per client in the addition of the time and attendance offerings. When you look at our product development work it's been about building mobility, so the clients have more choices to how they get to us and do their payroll, so they have a better online product now, and a much better mobility, I think the best app in the market place, for us from a payroll standpoint and combined services. So those kind of shore up the existing products for what clients expect now from a competitive standpoint. So if we didn\u2019t have mobility for example, I think it would improve sales and retention overtime, particularly the two national players compete and some of the regionals can\u2019t do as much in that standpoint. Then there is also -- when you take something like time and attendance, we didn\u2019t offer as robust a product few years ago as we do now and so that\u2019s the new revenue streams that have helped the HRS growth in time and attendance, HR administration online, both SaaS products, BeneTrac, the benefit and enrollment products that we added there and so forth. So it\u2019s a combination of shoring up and keeping you very competitive and then also adding more products to it. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets : Okay, great and then just one more question about the competition, and I totally realize that you grow your revenue in dollar terms more in a year than the size of most of these new upstarts. So looking at the growth rates is unfair but there just seems to be an awful lot of more press by very unscientific review of banner ads on the web and other things. It\u2019s just showing a lot more discussions around some of these upstarts. So in light of all that have you changed the mix or sophistication of how you\u2019re marketing and attracting customers, doing efforts to compete with what seems like some more brand awareness and probably somewhat more tech savvy new entrants trying to come after your market share? Martin Mucci : Yeah, a couple of things on that. One, I think that one of the positive things about all the press and some of these regional players going -- doing IPOs or partial IPOs I guess I\u2019d say is that they bring more awareness to the market of the products and so there\u2019s a little bit of plus there for all of us and I think when you look at Paychex or another national competitor, hopefully clients see a much bigger strength there of being around for 40 years and producing consistently solid results retention service numbers et cetera. So I think there\u2019s actually a little bit of plus there and we already have the competition, so it\u2019s interesting. From a marketing perspective we definitely have pushed a lot more on the web. We\u2019re picking up a lot more leads from the market search and that\u2019s been a bigger part of our approach. We also have found a much better way to handle those leads. We\u2019ve evolved into much more real time handling of the leads themselves that come in. So I think our marketing has picked up some, always can do I think more, but I think it\u2019s a balance of where do you spend the money, is it on marketing around sales, which we kind of put in, in that category and we always tend to give more on the sales side and put more on our actual execution of the sales team and put more money there for supporting the sales team and their execution. But I think the marketing -- our marketing has picked up, our website is much stronger, our whole process of handling the lead is stronger, and I guess that\u2019s how I look at it. I appreciate that you do talk about looking at absolute numbers of growth as opposed to percentages because that certainly means a lot to us. The amount of growth of what, 5% to 6% means for us is a lot bigger than sometimes the entire company that someone else might be looking at. Efrain Rivera : Hey Gary, one other thing I\u2019d add to what Marty said, we don\u2019t talk a lot about the efforts, that support sales but we have an entire organization where we\u2019ve made significant investments, our national sales support office here, both in terms of technology and numbers of people. And I would say, I would put our ability to both generate and convert leads up against anyone. We can put a person -- feet on the street within hours of getting a web lead, which I don\u2019t think many people can do. And we also have both SurePayroll, as I mentioned to some of you. SurePayroll and our core sales competing, we let them compete head to head in terms of web and sales lead. So we don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re missing anything that\u2019s occurring in the market. We just don't toot a horn with respect to that either. I think to be in this game long term, not short term but to be in it long term you would have to have a compelling service proposition and a compelling technology position. And what we have been doing is we have been improving both. Some people in the competition have not been doing that. We think long term the right solution that works is the one that combines, that creates a sustainable advantage by maximizing both, not just one. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets : Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. Operator :  Our next question comes from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead. Your line is open. Martin Mucci : Hi, Sara. Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. A question about checks per payroll trend and the 1% growth in the quarter; I know that your comparison was more difficult and you have highlighted that it would slow, but I am just wondering what you would expect going forward and if there\u2019s any potential mix impact on that? Efrain Rivera : There\u2019s a little bit of mix impact always, just to kind of refresh your recollection. We\u2019re not doing same store comparison, we do a little bit of validation and make sure it\u2019s not too whacky but it\u2019s not a same store comparison. We are just taking the amount of checks we admitted and comparing them to a prior period. So you get some mix effect in there. I think Sara what happened, we had a pretty strong Q3 last year. There was some Sandy overhang, there were bonuses in there, we think that may have affected that number. Now we\u2019re normalizing down in the -- I would say that we\u2019re down in the 1% -1.5% range that\u2019s what we have seen during the year. Our assumptions are that will continue to moderate but we\u2019ll see. We haven\u2019t got it precisely correctly, so you are going to get some variability there and our expectation is, one we will be probably moderating slightly down from there. Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, and then separately, could you talk a bit more about the new payment processing service with Elavon and I am wondering how that fits into the chain of client acquisition, since I generally think of clients signing up for credit card processing first and then maybe adding on payroll solutions after that. Martin Mucci : Well I think you know -- Sara you are right. I think when we went into this and we started trialing it we really kind of looked at that we are getting in pretty early on a new business and that we had -- because we had feet on the street we would get to the new businesses as they started up and would be successful in signing them up for the first time. And what we found in trialing it, in a number of zones around the country was that wasn\u2019t always the case and that, so we actually changed the sales model around and we sell more of that now basically over the phone and into the client base and we are having more success there. And so what we found and it's kind of its own animal. So you have to know the pricing, you have to know how to price it per transaction, the different kinds of businesses and what we found was a little bit more of a specialized team over the phone and concentrated could sell into the client base more successfully than 200 reps going at brand new clients the first time. So we trialed that around, found the best way we think to sell it and now we\u2019ve kind of officially introduced it and we\u2019re just starting to get you know some traction and results on it but we are definitely starting to get some traction. So we feel with -- you know over 500,000 clients and under that on the small business side that we have got a nice opportunity there, with Elavon obviously. So what we are doing is setting it up, we\u2019re getting to the client base who have the strength of knowing the Paychex brand and knowing that they already use us for money flow and so forth and that by trusting us that they\u2019ll sign up with us with competitive packages and all the solutions that Elavon brings and then we get a piece of that action on a go forward basis. Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim MacDonald of First Analysis. Go ahead. Your line is open. James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities :  Good morning guys. Back when you just reported HR client service in place on a sequential basis you sometimes had a more moderate growth over year-end given high attritions. It looks like you had a really good quarter, does that mean you actually had pretty good client employee growth over year-end this year? Efrain Rivera : I think we had good growth over year-end but I think Jim, we just really had strong sales in HR services overall. It\u2019s been a good sales year from that perspective. James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities : And does that processing day impact next quarter? You said that HR services wouldn\u2019t be at the low end, next quarter growth rate, is that as affected by processing day or is it something else there? Efrain Rivera : No, there is a little bit of impact on there but I also called out we had a very, very strong quarter in terms of HR solutions and look, we'd love to have every single quarter look like that. But at this point we don't think that will repeat quite to the extend it did this quarter. James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities : And just one final sort of technical question, so last quarter your SG&A sort of jumped a bunch, in this quarter it was didn't -- the increase wasn't very much at all. Anything going on there that I should know about? Efrain Rivera : Not really, what ends up happening, what's ending up happening in SG&A is that we are adjusting as we go through the year variable elements at constant terms. We get it right sometimes we overshoot a little bit. And we develop a view of kind of how it's going to project quarter-over-quarter. I would say in terms of the year we think it will be pretty close to what we expect to deploy, may be it shifted a little bit from one quarter to another. And then rate of IT spending also has an impact on that. So it can shift a little bit but not dramatically beyond what we expected when we started the year. James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities : Great, thanks guys. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Davis of Credit Suisse. Go ahead your line is open. Ryan Davis - Credit Suisse : Hi guys, this is Ryan calling in for George. I had the first question about the selling season. It sounds like you guys had some positive comments around it. Is it surrounding like the overall selling environment being better or is it may be a product of market share gains or combination of the two? Martin Mucci : I think -- well I think the overall environment is okay. I think it's still -- we would say from a new business start, one way to gauge it. Is it still fairly sluggish? I think new business starts are up a bit but it's nothing to kind of write home about. It's not back to pre-recession levels yet that we've seen employment is up a little, when we look at checks per payroll and so forth. So I think it's just kind of continued good execution on the sales side, more than that the environment is suddenly swelled or anything. I think we've seen some positive in the environment but it hasn't been anything to be overly excited about. We see kind of a steady improvement in the small business environment. Efrain anything you want to add to that? And I think as I said the execution has been consistent and in good there. So I think it's been just as much that more that than the environment itself. Efrain Rivera : You have to group it. Ryan Davis - Credit Suisse : Okay, fair enough. Now focusing in on the margins, ex [inaudible], they have been on a nice upward trajectory over the last several years. Is it a point where these -- it kind of takes a breather given commentary, I guess of accelerating new sales growth '14 over '13. And some of the acquisitions and the gracing cost, is it fair to assume these, the market could take a breather? Martin Mucci : I think we'll talk more about that when we get to the fourth quarter and talk about plans. The rates and the extent of leverages that is the function and part of top line growth. So as we grow top line more, we get more ability to leverage. So we have to go through the plan and look at it. I would just say what I say to everyone one on this point which is that when we go into a plan we look at trying to get leverage and when we get the leverage we try to beat it during the year. So that's what you see. Ryan Davis - Credit Suisse : Okay. And just one quick model maintenance question on start-up, it looked like there is a negative swing and the net change in funds held for clients' cash flow and balance pretty significant I guess what is that from? Martin Mucci : Not sure what exactly you are pointing to. Ryan Davis - Credit Suisse : So year-over-year it looked like there is $1.4 billion negative change in funds held for clients? Martin Mucci : I am sorry, yeah. Well it's -- I would urge you to really think about average funds held for clients. It really is very dependent on when a particular quarter closes, how much we have in funds, how much we have disbursed on that day or that quarter. On average if you look at our Q, I think nine months we call out the balance, the average balance $3.7 billion, so that's really what you need to focus on we're up about 5% for the nine months period. Quarter-to-quarter it can really, really swing and it's really a function of when the quarter ended, what funds we\u2019re holding, what payments needed to be made. Ryan Davis - Credit Suisse : Okay, thank you. Martin Mucci : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Go ahead sir. Your line is open. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup: Thank you. Hi, Marty, hi, Efrain. I guess my first question is with regards to the impact of new partner product that you introduced, some of it you covered, but there\u2019s been a range of payments, accounting, payroll cards, the new announcement recently. What is the revenue implication in terms of ramping revenues of that and also given their partner products as opposed to your own products how does that work with regards to margins and split of economics? Martin Mucci : Well, obviously we didn\u2019t gave too much detail on it from a competitive standpoint what we\u2019re doing with the partners exactly but I guess it's pretty small at the beginning with what we think that there is a nice value added advantage we have of getting into the client base and we decided instead of certain things like payment processing et cetera going out and acquiring a global payments process or our regional payments process was better to just get a commission on the sales there, on the ongoing transactions. And so it\u2019s positive but it\u2019s going to be pretty small compared to our overall revenue. We certainly hope that it will grow with the client base, as we penetrate the client base more but it\u2019s a little bit early to tell. When you look at the accounting that's a partnership with kind of an investment in Kashoo and then labeling our own product. So a piece of that it will be a pretty small for a while until we start converting clients and getting them to register and then overtime we may make a bigger investment there and then it starts to show up as a bigger impact on our revenue stream. So again these tend to be small longer-term investments that we think have a great opportunity to become significant but over the longer period of time. Efrain Rivera : The other thing Ashwin I\u2019d say and just echo what Marty said, it is a longer term play, but in the shorter term what we know is that the more products the client have the stickier they are. So that\u2019s a part of what we\u2019re trying to do is to build multiple touch-points with the client so that they are stickier within the base. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup: Right, understood. With regards to one of the product lines that you had for some time now healthcare, how big is it and with regards to ACA being I guess for the small business segment the below 100 being pushed out by maybe a year, is that affecting growth in the segment or are people looking forward and saying there is something they need to do? Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think from a size perspective I think we publicly said the agency is over a $100 million in revenue and that we have over a 100,000 clients, and that's for our insurance agency and I think specific to the health piece of it, as I mentioned earlier, it has moderated a bit, because I think clients -- it\u2019s been a good opportunity for us to get in front of client and support them with the products that we already rolled out which help them decide there is tools there as to whether on a monthly reporting and monitoring service whether it applies to them or not but I think all the confusion in the delays now the 50 to a 100 don\u2019t have to have insurance for their employees in \u201915, 2015 I think all that has moderated the sales of some of the products in short term. I do think as you approach the fall and people start looking at their annual premiums going up I think they will be well positioned to offer them options and in expertise to combine both because we offer that payroll company all the other solutions that we have, added services and an insurance agency, I think it will position us well. But it kind of pushed it out a bit as the rules have been and the requirements have pushed out. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup: Right, and just so I understand the people that -- your sales force that are selling whether it is specialized sales force and does it now have to be re-focused on other things or is it more fungible than that? Martin Mucci : No, it\u2019s a specialized sales force on the health and benefit side and the worker\u2019s comp insurance and other insurances side we are a full service agency. There are specific sales force that are licensed and sell those products in the field and over the phone and they are still out selling and there is good execution there, it's just not quite as big of an increase as we expected. We think it more moderate but it will continue to -- it's continuing to grow, that\u2019s for sure. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup: Okay, my last question is with regards to the index that you've introduced, how much of that is more of a branding exercise versus is there a lack of information in the public domain today that you will focus on bringing out? What sort of information is there in public domain? Martin Mucci : Yeah I mean there\u2019s a number of indexes out there but I think we felt we talked about this for number of years internally about whether to do it or not. We think that we\u2019re uniquely positioned because the one thing that we keep getting at is looking for more real time data on small business growth and we\u2019re taking basically a subset of our overall client base of 350,000 of the clients under 50 in creating an index with same store sale -- the same store that kind of shows year-over-year what the worker growth is for those clients. And the conclusion we came to was hey we have some unique data here. Typically you would get that kind of data from Federal Indexes that are or federal sources that are kind of lagged three quarters and that we were getting a push forward, hey how about some real time data from some of your clients, so we felt that we had something unique here. It\u2019s real time, it focus on under 50 and I think we have some of the best data in the business and so we produced an index that we think will add something a little bit different for the marketplace. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup: Okay, thank you guys. Good execution on the margin. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Martin Mucci : Thanks Ashwin. That's hard praise. Operator :  Our next question comes from Smitti Srethapramote at Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open. Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley : Hi, good morning. So couple of quick questions on pricing. You talked about offering a bundle of the core payroll product with some online solutions. What does pricing look like there? Is there a higher revenue per client solution or does it fall somewhere between the core product or just the pure SaaS product? Martin Mucci : No, it\u2019s really when you don't count your payroll and if you look at just the Paychex offerings there is no real difference. It\u2019s a complete offering for the small business under 50. You are looking at a complete offering with both online and that\u2019s part of the full suite. You are getting full service, dedicated service and you have the online and mobility it\u2019s all part of shoring up that product. The good news that we have seen is we\u2019re continuing to grow the revenue per client as we have said and we think that, that\u2019s been part of higher retention and better new business revenue being higher so a stronger I guess a stronger offering that is driving up the revenue per client and again we have said that the price increases are holding as well. So we think that\u2019s all part of a complete offering. When you look at your payroll it\u2019s a different offering. It\u2019s roughly a third typically in an average client that we see, we have said that and that\u2019s continuing to hold up very well on a price perspective as well. Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley : Got it and on the HR side you mentioned in the release that you are getting higher average premiums in worker\u2019s comp does it that going to translate into higher expected claims cost or is that all a pass-through? Efrain Rivera : No, that\u2019s just underlying rate that we would negotiate with [carriers]. It really doesn\u2019t have to do and on workers comp by the way at least within our agency that\u2019s broker business so we are not taking an interest on that portion of business. Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley : Got it. Okay, thank you. Martin Mucci : Welcome. Operator :  Our next question comes from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Go ahead. Your line is open. Jeffery Silber - BMO Capital Markets :  Thanks so much. I know it\u2019s late. I will just ask one quick one. Efrain on the guidance and looking at the operating margin, I know you said 38% could be 38.5% but even at that level it does imply some margin contraction for the fourth quarter. Is my math correct? Is there something going on that we should know about? Efrain Rivera :  You are right, Jeff and if you look at every fourth quarter kind of going back probably three years you see we have pretty significant contraction in the quarter and it\u2019s just a higher spend quarter in general and part of that, just to get kind of one level deeper is that IT spending typically has been going up double digits. This year is no exception and that ramps through the year, so that we exit the year at higher spending and then there\u2019s other sales related expenses that occur in that quarter, that typically kind of burden that margin a bit more. Jeffery Silber - BMO Capital Markets :  But would that still imply margin contraction on a year-over-year basis compared to fourth quarter last year? Efrain Rivera :  I haven\u2019t looked at quarter over quarter. I am just sticking to guidance. It shouldn\u2019t, Jeff even if we\u2019re between 38 and 39 we should be a little bit better. I have to look at it specifically. Jeffery Silber - BMO Capital Markets :  Okay, great. I think that\u2019s all I have got. All right, thanks I can follow up offline. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan Chase. Go ahead, your line is open. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Hey good morning. Martin Mucci : Good morning. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Yeah I just want to ask about retention, I am sorry if I missed this but did you give any color around what retention looked like in the quarter versus spend? Martin Mucci : Retention just started -- continues to be very strong. I think we're still looking approximately at the highest levels of retention we've had in our history, certainly five to six years. So we still feel very good about the client retention that we're seeing in the client base. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: All right, that's just good to know and then just, I know you had a lot of questions, not surprisingly about SaaS and some of the changes gone over in the public market place but just -- can you just give us a quick high level [inaudible] on just right now to date point solution versus service bureau sort of given all the stuff that's going on in the world with ACA and what have you, sort of what are you seeing on the ground in terms of preference between the two sides, because I know there can be push and pull at different periods of the cycle? Martin Mucci : Not seeing any drastic change, I think we continue because of the investments we've made and what we've rolled out. We feel good about the SaaS offerings that we have, both small market and large, that we're well positioned and the perspective from the offerings from the small business to mid-market, the time and attendance, the HR administration, the benefit enrollment all real SaaS solutions. But our focus has been very much offering the combination of that with the service, that's what folks are not seeing as much when they are usually when they are going somewhere else. We're still trying to give you that dedicated model and focusing that you have all the technology you have all the SaaS and cloud based solution that you want, all online now. There isn't -- we are not selling software that you are putting on your system and haven't been really for some time. It's all SaaS based and everything is becoming more and more integrated across the product set. So we feel very well positioned there, so even with all the hype we probably, as I think Efrain mentioned earlier we don't hype that as much and people look at us more as a service bureau but we are very much a SaaS based with the service model is how we look at it. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Yeah, that makes perfect sense. Just lastly I now want to go to the PEO stuff, a lot of good commentary there, are you making some incremental investments in the PEO, given some of the commentary around pick-up in demand? Martin Mucci : Yeah what we did previously, probably last year they went more to the SaaS model, the new online Paychex's next gen product. And so I think what we're seeing is that paid off -- that's being paying off very nicely because not only that we always have good service in the PEO model but as PEO kind of came more in favor, back in favor in the marketplace we were really well positioned to execute on the sales side not only for the need but because we have technology and the service level. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Great, great quarter guys, appreciate it. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Marcon of R. W. Baird. Go ahead your line is open. Martin Mucci : Hi Mark. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird: Hi, Efrain, hey Marty? Congrats on a great quarter. One strategic question, just as we continue to see an expansion in terms of the solution set, how are you thinking either or about build versus buy versus alliances as you optimize your solution set, just you had a couple of experiences, just how are you thinking about that? Martin Mucci : Yeah I think, we look at that a lot it's always -- we're very proud of the investment that we've made and that we're feeling good about them paying off as we kind of talked about through the call. But we're always on an eye to a year out, two years out, three years out in how well positioned are we in the various markets and we're very open to build or partner and always kind of looking pretty closely at that. We think we have a tremendous distribution model still. Our field sales team, of course the 3,000 sales people in the field have continued to execute and so it's all about how fast can we give them more to sell and what the best way to do that. And obviously you've seen kind of the smaller end when we look at payment processing we think there is an opportunity there, we partner. When we look at a new product like accounting online we partner. If we think that in various markets we're better our partnering we'll look at the we think that in various markets we\u2019re better off partnering we\u2019ll look at the economics of that and the opportunity to grow and we\u2019re very open to it. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird: Great and then with regards to some of the sales initiatives that you put in place such as going after franchises, can you just give us a little bit of sense for what areas have seen the strongest results in terms of the initiatives that you laid out at your analyst meeting? Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think one the banking channel that something that in the past we were much stronger on the CPA channel not as strong in the banks I think that Mark Bottini and the team there building a team that really are dedicated, more focused on the banks and support of the bank channel has led to all a number of referrals and sales there, and we\u2019ve seen that. We think that\u2019s been very successful particularly in certain markets and because we just focus better on, that was one of the initiatives the franchise has picked up as well. I would say even more successful in signing up the franchises and now we\u2019re kind of learning how best to service those franchises. So there is connections to subway, there is connections to Yum brands, there is Connexions there. Now we\u2019re learning who has more kind of cloud in those organizations because we\u2019re still not -- you are requiring them to sign up with you but you\u2019re driving influenced from the headquarters type of thing, and so we\u2019re learning a lot how best to partner with the headquarters and with the franchisees. But there\u2019s something we continue to invest in and I think that team has been very successful in building the relationships and signing up new franchisees from a corporate standpoint and now we got to pick-up the pay side on closing those franchisees and these we\u2019re finding different ways to sell into the markets once we have the agreement as well. So the initiatives on banks, franchisees and so forth we feel they are doing good. They\u2019re picking up momentum and so we\u2019re feeling pretty good about them. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird: That\u2019s great. And then one last question with regards to the expense performance this quarter, I mean it was basically isolated to the other line, what are some of the areas that just fluctuate within that? Efrain Rivera :  The other line\u2026 Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird: Yeah, so when we go through the Q, as an example there is -- you breakout expenses between wages and compensation, the other\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Yeah as you\u2019re looking at it by natural categories. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird: Yes. Efrain Rivera : I think, I\u2019d say this that our P&L is variable and we have a fair amount of ability to manage expenses intra-quarter and obviously based on what we\u2019re seeing in the year we can make adjustments as we go forward. So there\u2019s nothing unusual popping out in that category. We have higher IT expenses and we did a really good job on operating expenses, controlling that growth as the financial statements in the K, there\u2019s nothing strange going on there. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird: I was just wondering if you can keep that up. Efrain Rivera : Look if you ignore the natural category expense breakdown and look at what we\u2019re doing, step back a bit, what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re leveraging operating cost and we are continue to invest in IT so SG&A growing faster than sales primarily driven by G and ops expenses growing slower than sales. That trend, that macro-trend, irrespective of where it falls from a natural expense category standpoint is a trend that we expect to continue. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird: Great, thanks very much. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Martin Mucci : Thanks, Mark. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, your line is open. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank :  Hi this is Ashish Sabadra on behalf of Bryan. Martin Mucci : Hi. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank : Hi, most of my questions have been answered. Just a quick one on the CPA channel. I was just wondering if you could provide a quick update on that one. Martin Mucci : Yeah, that continues to be good for us, pretty solid across the board. We maintain those relationships and I think the only thing that would moderate that sum is just the new business growth as we\u2019ve said continues to be a bit sluggish and a lot of the new business referrals came from the CPAs. So that has probably tamped that down a little bit but the relationships and the approach from the CPAs and our referrals from them continue to be okay. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank : Great and just one more, quick question on the partnership model. Is there an opportunity for you to partner with other technology vendor and provide services as on top of that, these could be into a segment where you\u2019ve not currently tapped them, could be much more the big mid-tier clients or other HR solutions that you currently don't have in your portfolio. I was just wondering if you could just comment on that. Martin Mucci : Yeah we are always -- I might have mentioned earlier, we're always open to that. We think we're not going to go too far flung from what we do but in providing strength to the employer-employee relationship and if there is a technology need or a market that we think we can be very successful in and leverage the great 3,000 sales people that we have out there that execute well and we can bring them something else. We would certainly be open to that versus building. It's always a matter of looking at the economics of that and certainly what we think is our level of success. So we're certainly open to it and always looking at those alternatives. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank : Okay thanks. Martin Mucci : All right. Operator : Our next question comes from Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery. Go ahead. Your line is open. Martin Mucci : Hi, Joe. Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hi, how are you guys. I got a ton of questions, how much time do we have left? I am just kidding. So just two quick ones, hopefully they are quick, but how do you measure the progress of the technology upgrades? In other words I am wondering do you measure that per usage and if there is any color, if not that's fine and then just one quick follow-up. Efrain Rivera : Yeah I wouldn't say as much and usage at this point as it is the selling. So are we selling it, are we competitive. And again with good continued sales execution we feel good about that and increased penetration. So we're seeing increased attachment and increased penetration in those SaaS solution so we feel that, that's a good marker for us. And then certainly retention and we see good retention of the products that we're rolling up from a technical standpoint. And so we closely monitor that, we look at obviously all the surveys that we are doing on top of that and are counseling, tweaking and changing to keep competitive. So I think it's more of a measurement of that then usage necessarily of the product itself. Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Okay. And then secondly it sounds like the business is better after sort of slogging away at it for quite some time here. Yet the traditional catalyst like small business starts haven't necessarily picked up. Should we start thinking about that differently? Are there -- you finding new catalysts within the business that can pick up the slack even though we haven't seen the traditional ones pick up steam? Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think that's fair. I mean we still have a good percentage of sales that come from new businesses and while that's sluggish it certainly is up from where it was last year. It's not back to pre-recession levels. So I do think -- I don't want to mislead you and think that new business still isn't the strong part of our business. We're still very good at that and get referrals from CPAs and new business and banks and so forth. But I do think that we -- knowing that we were -- that, that continued to be kind of sluggish coming back we look for new ways to attract to get referrals, that we've looked at new ways to retain clients, we looked at new products in investing a lot of the technology investment has been that we also I think have gotten -- we've done a nice job in building the revenue per client. And so we're taking even getting better at saying we've done a lot of product here to sell into the client base. And we're not going to wait around for the economy to be super strong, let's just sell in to the client base as well as bring in new clients. And I think may be that mix is -- it's changing a little bit. Efrain anything you want to add? Efrain Rivera : Hi, Joe, so I think that the execution we're seeing is a result of our ability to extract value from the distribution base we've got and there is long way we've got a long way to go in that process. Martin Mucci : I think we've also found new ways to refinance, so if you take like our initiatives on 401(k), we've always sold into the small market but we would say small market for 401(k), very successful. And but we started looking at how do we increase that over what we've always been doing. And we found a way to go in to the large market, larger assets for clients and we really sent build our sales team just focused on that, build a team small team focused on financial advisers and getting more leads from them. So we're not just going to traditional. We really worked hard to find new ways to grow what we've always been good at. Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Our last question comes from David Grossman of Stifel Financial. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open. Martin Mucci : Hi, David. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, sorry I am late here, actually got on the call late so if this has been answered we can take this offline but just really quickly I had a quick question about the exchanges, where are you, I know you had announced a partnership with one of the small business exchanges. Just kind of wondering where you are in that process and what impact you expect the exchanges to have on your business both near term as well as out two or three years based on what you know right now. Martin Mucci : Yeah I think Evolution1 was the partner we were in with and we have that set up and we are not -- one of the things that what we were trying to do there was help businesses, small businesses who are under pressure to give to -- we don't have to do small business group insurance, small group insurance but want to provide something to their clients to do some pretax and then go over to the private exchange and use that. Unfortunately some of the changes in the healthcare reform kind of took away that benefit at least at this point the pretax benefit. So if I am a small group employer and I want to just give you know $300 a month to my employee pretax that\u2019s not really necessarily an alternative anymore, that it\u2019s going to be pretax and so forth. So it\u2019s slowed kind of that whole thing for us on the private exchange piece. We still have the partnership, we still offer it. It\u2019s just not quite as attractive as it was previously and that may still change as these rules kind of solidify over the next year or so. And then the exchanges in general we have not seen as much of a loss, I would say to the exchanges yet that we thought we might see on the small business side and we haven\u2019t -- we have seen the sales to those who need insurance. We\u2019ve seen that moderated as I mentioned earlier, just we haven\u2019t seen as much of a decision making process from the clients because they are kind of confused and they realize like 50 to 100 don't have to do anything now in 2015, up till 2016. So I would say overall the whole exchange piece hasn\u2019t caused any major disruption. It also hasn\u2019t accelerated anything. It\u2019s been a more moderate kind of thing and we expect to see more of the opportunity and maybe the impact in the next fiscal year as they approach 2016 will be the bigger impact. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.:  Right, great, thanks very much. Martin Mucci : Okay. Efrain Rivera : You are welcome. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Martin Mucci : Great. Thank you. And at this point we\u2019ll close the meeting. And if you are interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call it will be archived for approximately a month until April 28. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our third quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

If anyone has any objections you may disconnect. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Martin Mucci. You may begin. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex's fiscal 2014 year-end performance. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.  Yesterday afternoon after the market closed we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2014. We expect to file our Form 10-K by the end of July. Our earnings press release is available by accessing our Investor Relations page at paychex.com. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about a month. On today's call I will review the highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 in operations, sales and product development areas. Efrain will review our fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 financial results and discuss our fiscal 2015 guidance, and then we'll open it up for your questions. We are pleased with our solid financial performance during fiscal 2014. Efrain will speak to this in more detail. However I would like to provide you some of the highlights from my view. Our payroll service revenue reached the top of our guidance range, driven by progress in revenue per check, client-based growth in checks per payroll. HRS revenues rose at double-digit rate in the fourth quarter with strong demand for our human resource outsourcing solutions and our 401(k) record keeping product. In fact we were recently recognized by Plansponsor Magazine for the fourth quarter consecutive year as the largest 401(k) record keeper by number of plans. We\u2019re very proud of that and proud of our sales and operations teams in 401(k) among the other groups. Our payroll client base finished the year at approximately 580,000 payroll clients, an increase of approximately 2% from the prior year. This is an improvement over the fiscal 2013 client gain. Our checks per payroll has improved for 17 consecutive quarters. Fourth quarter growth was 1.1%. Sales performance during 2014 was strong and we exited the year with solid performance in core payroll and Paychex HR Outsourcing solutions in particular. Our new sales annualized revenue growth frankly reached the highest level it has in seven years. We\u2019re very proud of the sales team and the leadership. Our execution in operations also continued to be excellent, demonstrated by our consistently high client satisfaction scores and our exceptional client service coupled with our leading edge technology and products, we really believe sets us apart from our competitors. The dedication of our service team resulted in our best year ever in client retention at approximately 82% of our beginning payroll client base.  We continue to invest in our SaaS, software-as-a-service solutions and mobility offerings that position us for long term growth. We\u2019re experiencing an increased demand for SaaS solutions across our client base. This month we acquired a leading cloud-based time and attendance solution provider. Our online time and attendance offerings have experienced strong sales over the last few years demonstrating the high market demand for these offerings and contributing to the success of all our online HR administration products. The addition of market leader nettime\u2019s SaaS time and attendance products and development team will further accelerate our ability to deliver the latest cloud-based time and attendance functionality coupled with our HR and payroll solutions. Just last week we also announced the release of our new Paychex\u2019s accounting online mobile app for the iPhone. The universal iOS app allows users to access their Paychex accounting online account from their iPad, iPhone or iPod touch to keep track of their business finances anywhere and anytime. In the past few quarters I have talked about the roll-out of new products designed to help our clients manage the compliance requirements of healthcare reforms. This includes our Paychex employers share responsibility service, a more robust monitoring service and our Paychex benefit account. These products while new to the market represent an opportunity for us as we\u2019re uniquely positioned as both a payroll provider and insurance agency to help our small businesses with these regulations.  The frequent changes in the rules has caused some clients to delay decisions on purchasing products or making decisions under health plans in the short term. However we continue to see healthcare reform as an opportunity as we\u2019re able to provide clients with information and keep them updated on the latest compliance and requirements. We continue to strength our position as an expert in our industry by serving as a source of education and information to our clients, small and midsize businesses and other interested parties. We provide free webinars, white papers and other information on our website to aid existing and prospective clients along with CPAs and other interested parties with the impact of regulatory changes.  The Paychex Insurance Agency, Inc., website helps small business owners navigate the area of insurance coverage and both this website and Paychex.com have sections dedicated to the topic of healthcare reform.  During the fourth quarter in conjunction with IHS we launched the Paychex IHS Small Business Jobs Index. This monthly Index examines the state of small business employment in the U.S. and provides information on macroeconomic trends. By measuring aggregated small business payroll data from a subset of our small business client base the Index identifies and tracks small business employment growth and provides timely, accurate insight in to employment trends. We are encouraged by the recent results of the Index which have shown a trend of sustained moderate growth in employment for those companies under 50 employees.  We\u2019ve continued our shareholder friendly actions as well. We\u2019ve maintained a very competitive dividend yield with our current quarterly dividend at $0.35 per share and we\u2019ve also continued to repurchase Paychex stock and acquired approximately six million shares of common stock in fiscal 2014. In May our Board approved a new plan to repurchase stock up to 350 million shares -- $350 million worth of shares of Paychex common stock with the authorization expiring in May of \u201817. In summary I am extremely proud of our employees\u2019 efforts on behalf of our clients and our shareholders. They have continued to deliver great solutions, high client satisfaction and record levels of client retention. We\u2019ve a solid leadership team that is clearly focused on sales and service execution, technology innovation and product expansion to drive our plans in fiscal 2015. Our service revenue has increased over $400 million in over the last three years versus very little growth over the previous three. And even with accelerated product investment and innovation we\u2019ve maintained the industry leading operating margins. We\u2019re clearly focused on growth by providing our clients, the service and products that will help them succeed in their small and midsize businesses. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks Marty and good morning. I would like to remind everyone that during today's conference call we'll make forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risks. Refer to our press release, that includes a discussion of forward-looking statements and related risk factors, the customary disclosure.  As Marty indicated Paychex delivered solid results in fiscal 2014 and just as importantly metrics improved across almost every category we looked at. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter and fiscal \u201914 and then I\u2019ll provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of the 2015 outlook. We introduced new health insurance offering within our PEO during fiscal 2014. Due to self-insurance provisions within the new offering we began classifying certain PEO direct costs as operating expenses rather than a reduction in service revenue. The change had no impact on net income, a supplemental schedule was added to the press release to show the impact of the classification change on the fiscal 2014 results of operations.  For this discussion of fiscal 2014 results I'm going to provide growth percentages that exclude the impact of these adjustments in order to focus on the business drivers and what\u2019s currently in your models. In future periods all discussions will use results reflecting this change in classification.  Total service revenue grew 6% for both the quarter and the fiscal year. Interest on funds held for clients increased 2% for the fourth quarter and decreased 1% for the fiscal year to $10 million and $41 million respectively. Low interest rates were partly offset by an increase in average investment balances. Expenses increased by 4% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the fiscal year. The increase was mainly in compensation-related cost with higher wages and higher performance-based comp. Wages were impacted by our investment in product development and supporting technology and new sales initiatives implemented in fiscal 2013. Operating margin was 35.9% for the fourth quarter and a robust 38.7% for fiscal 2014. Operating income net of certain items increased 8% to $218 million for the fourth quarter and 9% to $942 million for fiscal 2014. We are closing in on the $1 billion mark for EBIT and should surpass that next year. Operating margin is typically lower as you know in the second half of the year.  Net income growth increased 18% to $146 million for the fourth quarter and 10% to $628 million for the fiscal year. Remember that and I\u2019ve seen this in a couple of notes that there\u2019s an implication to the guidance somehow we decelerated from this year but you need to remember that we took a $0.04 write-off in the fourth quarter of last year and that is what\u2019s causing the fourth quarter to look high.  Diluted earnings per share increased 18% to $0.40 per share for the fourth quarter and increased 10% to $1.71 per share for fiscal 2014. And I would just point out again that these numbers include the fact that we took -- increased our provision for state income tax matter in the fourth quarter.  Looking at payroll revenues, payroll service revenue, it increased 3% for the fourth quarter and 4% for the fiscal year. We benefited from increases in revenue per check, client base and checks per payroll. Revenue per check was positively impacted by price increases partially offset by discounting coupled with the impact of increased product penetration. As Marty already mentioned our checks per payroll metric continued to improve and our client base increased approximately 2% from May 31, 2013. So the rate of growth on improvement in the client base accelerated this year. The payroll service revenue rate of growth was lower in the fourth quarter and this was a result as I mentioned throughout the year, one less payroll processing day compared to the same period in the prior year. The estimated impact on payroll revenue growth in the quarter was approximately 1% based on that lack of a day. HRS revenue, point out that during the year we upped guidance on HRS revenue and in the fourth quarter we grew 10%, to $213 million and 12% to $832 million for the fiscal year. Both were at the top end or the yearly guidance was at the top end of the range as Marty mentioned.  We continued to experience rapid growth in both our ASO and PEO as well as in our online HR administration products. Paychex HR solutions experienced solid growth in clients and client employees served. You\u2019ll notice that we did the disclosure, including the press release, we are up to almost 800,000 clients served and it won't be too long before we're talking about 1 million clients served by our products. Our PEO experienced strong demand during fiscal 2014. HR administration products continued to grow due to success in sales of SaaS solutions, in particular for our time and our attendance products. Retirement services revenue benefited from growth in number of plans, as Marty mentioned our recent recognition and an increase in the average asset value of retirement services, client employees\u2019 funds. Insurance services revenue growth reflected higher average premiums in worker's comp insurance services. We have also experienced a modest increase in the number of health and benefit applicants. Turning to our investment portfolio our long-term portfolio which is primarily made up of high credit quality municipal bonds is an average yield currently of about 1.6% and an average duration of three years. Combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of nine-tenths of a point for the fourth quarter and 1% for fiscal 2014 consistent with the same period last year. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased during both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year due to growth in checks per payroll and client base and wage inflation. For the fiscal year average balances also benefited from the expiration of certain payroll tax cuts on December 31, 2012 which resulted in higher social security withholdings.  I'll now walk you through highlights of our financial position that remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $937 million and no debt. That 937 is despite the fact that if you've read the press release that we spent $250 million in the year buying back shares. So we had a really strong year from a cash flow perspective, you can see that on the statement of cash flows. And I would say our financial strength is second to none.  Funds held for clients as of May 31, 2014 were $4.2 billion compared to $4.1 billion as of May 31, 2013. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.9 billion for the fiscal year, a year-over-year increase of about 4%. Total available-for-sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $35 million as of May 31, 2014. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $1.8 billion as of May 31, 2014 reflecting $511 million in dividends paid during the fiscal year. Dividends paid represented 81% of net income on return on equity for the past 12 months with 35%. Cash flows from operations, as I mentioned, were $881 million for the fiscal year, up 30% increase compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by higher net income, higher non-cash adjustments in net income largely due to higher amortization on premiums available for sales securities and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation, PEO payroll and income taxes, fluctuations in income tax payments related to the settlement of a state tax matter in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.  Now turning to 2015 guidance, I would like to remind you that our outlook for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015 is based on current view of economic and interest rate continuing with no significant changes. Our guidance for 2015 is as follows; payroll service revenue projected increase in a range of 3% to 5%; projected growth is based on anticipated client-based growth and increases in revenue per check.  HRS is expected to be in the range of 16% to 19%. This and total service revenue reflect change in classification of certain PEO direct cost as operating expenses rather than a reduction in service revenue. There is no impact in net income from the change. The impact of the change in classification and HRS revenue will add approximately 5% of the HRS revenue growth rate. The HRS revenue growth rate by quarters impacted by the classifications of PEO direct cost as we did not begin on new health insurance offering until January of 2014. I am going to come back to that. It\u2019s very important as you look at your models that you understand that implication. HRS revenue growth also includes additional revenue from 401(k) plan restatements that are periodically required by law. Total service revenue is expected to increase in the range of 8% to 10%. The impact of the change in PEO classification adds approximately 2% to the service revenue growth rate. Operating income net of certain items as a percent of service revenue is expected to be in the range of 37% to 38% for fiscal 2015. Again this is based on the PEO changes to revenue. That\u2019s why that number is lower than it was last year, so it does not imply any deterioration in our operating margins. Net income is expected to increase in the range of 6% to 8%. Our operating income, net of certain items as a percent of service revenues is expected to be between 37% and 38%. The PEO direct cost impacted by the reclassification are all reported in operating expenses. As you update your models I\u2019ll have more to say about that in a second. Effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 is expected to be consistent with the rate we experienced in 2014. And interest on funds is anticipated to be relatively flat compared to fiscal 2014. Don\u2019t expect it to be above it, don\u2019t expect it to be significantly below it. And then while we don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance the PEO impact to revenue requires further detail for you to accurately update your models. At the close of this call we will post a schedule on the website detailing quarterly HRS revenue growth expectations for fiscal 2015 as well as operating income margin due to the PEO reclassification. You need to look at that schedule to understand how to get the quarters right. The effects on revenue and margin are going to vary by quarter. The effects will be more marked in the first two quarters and then more attenuated in the back half because the plans that we put in place started in January in the PEO. So you should consult the schedule as you update your models. I'm happy to answer any questions you have and I\u2019ll try to get to you if you want to call me today, happy to get to you quickly. And finally we anticipate the first quarter earnings growth will be modest due to investments in IT and sales force growth, and what happened was, compared to last year, we start the year at a higher rate of spending in IT than we did in the first quarter of last year. That\u2019s because we continue to make significant investments in IT and also we were adding to the sales force. As the year progressed we continue to add to the sales force. We anticipate that we will be up approximately 5% in the sales force this year. We like what we\u2019re seeing and feel now\u2019s the time to invest. So with that I will turn it back over to Marty. Martin Mucci : Okay thank you Efrain and now operator if you will open the meeting to any questions please. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And the first question comes from David Togut with Evercore. Your line is open. David Togut - Evercore Partners : Thank you, good morning Marty and Efrain. Martin Mucci :  Hi, David. Efrain Rivera : Good morning. David Togut - Evercore Partners : Marty you indicated that FY\u201914 new sales, annualized revenue growth was the highest in seven years. Can you quantify for us what the sales growth was? Martin Mucci : Dave, we don\u2019t normally give that detail. I will just tell you that what we\u2019ve seen has just continued to accelerate kind of throughout the year as we -- and we ended very strong in new sales revenue growth. And I think you know a few years ago we were fairly flat in the total annualized revenue that we were producing in sales and it\u2019s started to pick up last year, and it\u2019s continued to pick-up again this year and it is the best we\u2019ve seen really since recession times, pre-recession. David Togut - Evercore Partners : Can you maybe just bracket for us what the range might be, are you talking about mid-singles, high-singles, low-doubles? Efrain Rivera : It\u2019s in advance of our revenue growth. So that\u2019s what we look at. David Togut - Evercore Partners : Got it, and then with the new fiscal year kicking off can you quantify what your pricing strategy is in payroll for FY\u201915, did you already put through the price increase? Efrain Rivera : We do tend to do that somewhere around this time. I won\u2019t say exactly the date. Most of you actually know it. But I think our pricing view is what we\u2019ve said -- we\u2019re in that range of 2% to 4%. David Togut - Evercore Partners : And what do you expect that to be net of discounts this year, ballpark? Efrain Rivera : In the range. Sorry to be too coy. Martin Mucci : It's a little early but I think based on what we've seen last year and this year we don't -- it's early right now on the feedback on that but I would say to the low to the mid-part of that range. David Togut - Evercore Partners : Do you expect client count growth to approximate what it was in FY\u201914 or to increase based on the pipeline? Efrain Rivera : Well hey look, it is July hard to believe. I think we would like it at least to equal this but our expectation, it will be better yeah. David Togut - Evercore Partners : Got it and just\u2026 Efrain Rivera : On that point I will say this that we exited the year in the fourth quarter at a nice clip. So we feel pretty good about where we're at, where we're starting the year. David Togut - Evercore Partners : Got it, and just a quick final question. Efrain you highlighted the strong tax spending expected in FY\u201915, can you quantify for us the growth in tax spending this year and perhaps if you could touch on what your top couple of priorities are for that spending? Efrain Rivera : On the priorities I will knock it back to Marty but I would say if you go back two or three years we were saying we were growing at close to 20% in some years. If you look at where we are in the last six years we've doubled the total amount of spend in the company. I mean it's a part of the fundamental changes company has undergone, our rate of spend now is essentially twice what it was when we entered the recession. That was a deliberate strategy -- we are, we understand this is a technology-enabled service business and that going forward we need to continue to spend at that sustained level. That doesn't imply an increase from where we're spending currently. It just implies that we continue to spend at a pretty significant rate and then, and the thing I am most proud of is that we do that and we expand margins which is pretty extraordinary. So and we think we still have an opportunity to do that. So I won't detail exactly what we spend, it was certainly solidly double digit and each one of those decisions around spending on tech is hard fought but I think that an emphasis that the company has created over the last six or seven years is significant investments in IT because that's the cost of being in this business. So I'll turn it over to Marty. Martin Mucci : Yes, I\u2019d say on the product overall it's integration and performance, so very broad spectrum of products that we have through both development and acquisition and our work has continued to be on integrating that. We've made a lot of strides in that. We just continue to keep -- trying to make it easier and easier for our clients that use the multitude of products. And then when we do that as well as the integration and simplicity of using all the products is the speed and the performance and we just keep up in the -- what were the goals of what we're trying to do there and we've had some nice success. Of course the mobility and so forth as well everything just keeps moving. We don\u2019t build anything without going right back at it to make it faster and more integrated and easier to use. David Togut - Evercore Partners : Much appreciated. Thanks for taking my questions. Martin Mucci : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you and the next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Your line is open. Ryan Cary - Jefferies & Co.: Hey guys, this is Ryan Cary for Jason. Quick question on checks for payroll, I know in the past you had mentioned expectation that checks for payroll will moderate in the second half of '14, is the 1.1% growth you saw in the fourth quarter kind of more or less than you expected? And then going forward should we expect the first half of '15 to return to the first half of '14 levels or more consistent with the current run rate kind of like that 1%, is that going to be the new normal? Efrain Rivera : Yeah -- so second question, second - same as the first, 1% is about what we expected and we quite frankly could see it moderate a little bit from where we are at this point, going in to next year. We don't expect it to pop up and with the launch of our Small Business Index I think we look at that data even more closely than we did before. And trends just seem to be slowly kind of plugging along at that rate. Martin Mucci : That's kind of unchartered territories but after recession it continues to be kind of sustained, moderate growth in employment. So it's not going to be big jump back, it's been a slow and steady so to actually keep the growth in checks this long has been very different. So we continue to expect that to moderate but the hiring does seem to continue, so that\u2019s good news. Ryan Cary - Jefferies & Co.: Okay, great. And as we think about the quarterly progression results going into \u201915 are there are any quarters we should be aware of that have either more or fewer processing days that can impact comps either direction? Efrain Rivera : Yeah, thanks good question. The answer is no, thankfully I exhausted all my day\u2019s explanation but stay tuned for fiscal \u201916, we\u2019ll talk about it then. Ryan Cary - Jefferies & Co.: Okay, and just lastly from me, I was hoping you could provide an update on the progress with payment processing offering. How has the update been compare to your expectations I\u2019d love any color on kind of how the rollout is going and your thoughts about the business going forward. Martin Mucci : Yeah, it started slow and what we found was using a lot of the field payroll forces, the sales forces, to sell it became a little more complex than we thought because of the complexity of the pricing. And so what we did was last year around half way through the year we brought it inside so it\u2019s referred from the outside sales force and now is sold primarily over the telephone and that has really started to pick up some traction. So it\u2019s still early and very small from our standpoint but it\u2019s really picking up good traction now by selling it. We\u2019re a dedicated team who understands the details of the pricing per client. It actually has even given us some payroll leads where we\u2019ve sold payment processing saved the clients in dollars and actually been referred to other products and sold other products to them. So we\u2019re feeling pretty good about it. Finally it\u2019s really starting to build some traction and more to come on that. Ryan Cary - Jefferies & Co.: Great, appreciate the color guys. Efrain Rivera : Thanks. Operator : Next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank : Hi this is Ashish Sabadra calling on behalf of Brian Keane. A quick question on the guidance. Last year I believe when you gave the guidance the range was within a percentage. This time you\u2019ve given a 2% range. I was just wondering if there has been any change in your guidance philosophy. Efrain Rivera : No, not really. I think it doesn\u2019t imply more volatility. On the HRS side we went to three points simply because attachment rates on some of the other -- on healthcare can sometimes vary but we thought just to keep it more consistent. We\u2019re obviously pegging at the middle of the guidance, that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing but the future is uncertain and we put those ranges represented what -- where we could end up. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank : Okay actually just a quick follow up on that, you mentioned you\u2019re pegging it to the middle of the range but just wondering because at the low end of the range it would imply a slowdown in the growth rate but given that payroll is improving, small business sentiments are improving what will take you to the low versus high end of the range? Efrain Rivera : Unforeseen factors that at this point we don\u2019t see. You never know, I will say that if you saw two years ago we guided to, I believe at that time it was around 3% to 4% in payroll. We ended up at 2% and I spent three quarters trying to explain a multitude of external factors that everyone assumed were competition when they weren\u2019t. So that stuff can come up. Q3 was a great example so suddenly we end up with some pretty bad storms and it becomes more complicated. So stuff like that can happen, so we trying to kind of create a more all-weather scenario for where we think our results will be but in the absence of those we don\u2019t anticipate being at the low end of the range. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank : Okay, thanks for the color. Quickly on -- when we add up the number of the customer growth of 2% and then checks per client of roughly 1, 1.3 and pricing increases they don\u2019t add up to the revenue growth and I was wondering is that also related to the mix in the sense SurePayroll or if you could help us parse out what the customer growth how much is driven by SurePayroll versus the core payroll growth and if the mix also has some impact? Efrain Rivera : Yeah, mix has some impact but I think you can\u2019t just add it, I\u2019ve mentioned this to people repeatedly checks don\u2019t add up, one for one. So 1% checks doesn\u2019t equate to 1% revenue. There\u2019s mix within checks so that might equate to 33% of that 50% or sometimes a little bit more.  Second, client growth is achieved over the course of the year. So you can add two it at best is half of that, right, because it\u2019s a weighted average during the year and then you got to figure out pricing. So we feel pretty good, we saw growth across all the segments that we thought should grow in core. And I would say this for people who wonder about that issue, if you look at our data, if you look at our data over since 2011 and you look at our revenue retention, we've grown 200 basis points in revenue retention. You saw client retention at its highest level, Marty didn\u2019t talk too much about that, but client retention currently is at its highest level. But our revenue retention is at its highest level too. So we feel pretty good about where we're at. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank : That's great. One final question from me was the HRS, the growth slowed down a bit in the fourth quarter. Was that mostly tough comps or were there any other factors? Efrain Rivera : It was primarily tough comps. We had a really, really strong Q3 and actually last year we had a real strong Q4. So a little bit tougher comp, it was really not too much else going there. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank : Okay, thanks for the color. Operator : Next question is from Sara Gubins with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, thank you. Are you seeing any change in the average client size for payroll services? You talked about that being about I think it's was around 17 or so before, is that changing at all? Efrain Rivera : Hey, I am going update that Sara, it looks like we skewed a little bit higher this year. Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Efrain Rivera : So we\u2019ll update it. I don't have the exact number in but our preliminary data would suggest we were up closer to 18, but we'll get that info out. Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Do you think that there is, I might be pushing this a little bit but do you think that there is anything related to the strong growth in HR services as I would assume that there would be a greater propensity to buy from slightly larger clients? Martin Mucci : May be a little bit but I will tell you that what we're finding is that we're definitely selling more of the products, even more of the products down market. Things are -- everything is coming down and it's giving us a nice opportunity to sell to the even the under 20 space many more products. So I wouldn't say it's probably that because what we're finding is these products are even selling more down below 20. Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great and then just last question on share count. Could you may be help us think through the balance between the share purchases that you did over the course of the year and not seeing the share count decline close to that magnitude, just talk about the issuance? Efrain Rivera : Yeah good question. So I guess the way I\u2019d characterize it is this way is if you look at Q4 our share count finally went down in Q4. So vis-\u00e0-vis Q4 last year and this year you started to see it come down. We had a fair -- when the stock ran from let's say 30, low 30s up to 45 we had a lot of exercises in pent up demand because there was a significant amount of shares still out there. So we had about 3.3 or so million dollars of projects, 3.3 million shares that were exercised.  So long story short we saw that and we wanted to buy the offset dilution and that's why you don\u2019t see necessarily a significant reduction in the number of shares. Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Sure. Operator : Next is from Joseph Foresi with Janney Capital Markets. Your line is open. Martin Mucci : Hi, Joe. Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Capital Markets :  Hi, good morning. This is Jeff Rossetti in for Joe. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to see on the margin side I think Efrain you had mentioned you are expecting sales force to increase about 5%. I just want to see how that ended up with how the year ended and just want to see how when we think about your guidance for margins should we assume some SG&A to increase as a percentage of revenue and there is still to be some operating leverage with respect to operating expenses? Efrain Rivera : Yeah, so I would say this, it's going to be lumpy in the first half of the year and you are going to have to look at the schedule we've got because it's very difficult to talk about leverage, Jeff without referring to that schedule. It won't look like there is leverage it looks like we're deleveraging and you are going to see that really frankly through the first three quarters and then you start to level out a bit in Q4. So you got to look at that schedule. If you look at it and you don't have the data but if you were to look at it without that yes you would see some leverage, it would be modest. We've made a decision that probably cost us approximately a penny to increase, put more into and increasing the sales force. We thought that made sense and so we decided that investment was the right one to do. Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Capital Markets : Okay, thanks and maybe just, could I get some additional color on the SaaS kind of penetration that you\u2019ve seen recently and I was also wondering, I think you Marty had mentioned that there\u2019s still some like slow decision makings on healthcare-related plans. I just want to see if that changed at all in the last few months, I think maybe some more commentary was given three months ago, just wanted to see have you seen any changes going forward? Thanks. Martin Mucci : Yeah I\u2019ll start on the healthcare one, I think we\u2019ve continued to see that. I think particularly that may happen through the summer, until you get more closer to the fall as benefit plans starts rolling out and people start seeing rates and so forth for January 1st for starts. I think what we\u2019re finding is just there\u2019s been so many changes in healthcare reform and dates that the clients are more kind of like sitting back a little bit, so even though we had the products out pretty early we are getting some traction on the products because it\u2019s clients have to start to understand right now what changes they may have to make in part time, full time when they hire the next person, what kind of impact that\u2019s going to have to them particularly if they\u2019re around the 50 mark.  And so I think it\u2019s kind of picked up a little bit towards the end of the summer but it still been slower than we expected and I think that\u2019s because of the changes. So haven\u2019t seen a lot of change there. On the SaaS it continues to increase. We don\u2019t really give a percentage but you can see everything we\u2019re doing pretty much is in investment is in SaaS. The acquisition in nettime was also for SaaS. So we\u2019re seeing a big pickup in SaaS-related products for the HR services and support, HR administration, benefit enrollment, time and attendance, expense tracking, everything frankly that we offer is pretty much now on a SaaS basis and that we\u2019re seeing a large pick-up on it. So that will just continue to grow and frankly it won\u2019t even be a discussion of non-SaaS, it will be just SaaS. Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Capital Markets : Thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Martin Mucci : Hi Gary. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets : Hi, just want to understand exactly why the accounting change or the change in how you\u2019re presenting the data you\u2019re not taking any insurance risk, there is nothing like that that forces you to recognize this. I'm assuming and if that\u2019s right and why make this change? Thank you. Martin Mucci : Yeah so Gary let me just explain this. And without again going too far down a hole with the way you account for a cost in the PEO, we, in certain markets decided that it made sense for us to go to something called the minimum premium plan where your risk is capitated but you do take some risk based on the book. And within the PEO and most PEOs do risk you were taking risk also on worker\u2019s comp. So you have to do some underwriting, you have to be pretty good at underwriting to do it. That is not all of our PEO plans but it is some of them. When we did that, that tipped us to now represent those -- that portion of the revenue as gross, essentially include the cost of insurance. So I would say yes we do take a bit more risk but it\u2019s capped. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets : Okay and so you would have an insurance provider that would be offering you like the equivalent of you would be capped out at a number per current, right okay all right, should we think about this as something that might modestly increase the volatility or are you pretty confident in the underwriting in the history of the data such that you have a strong ability to predict this? Martin Mucci : Which volatility, top line or bottom line? Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets : Well I mean if there is ever a difference between what the actual insurance costs are relative to what you forecast? Because you\u2019re taking more risk\u2026 Martin Mucci : So let me take, yeah -- thanks for the question because I think it\u2019s a great question. So the short answer is it really shouldn\u2019t have a dramatic impact on income unless you really don\u2019t do your homework and start taking risk that are inappropriate. So I think we understand one of the really terrific stories over the last three years is that if you remember the calls we were having three, four years ago, about how the PEO wasn\u2019t doing well. Behind the scenes we decided that we needed to put a major effort against fixing it and we did. So we do a really good job now of understanding what our risks are in a PEO. So you shouldn't see significant amounts of fluctuation based on earnings but the rates of attachment of all these plans can't swing sometimes, the top line. So you could have a little bit more volatility on the top line. That's why we called out in a schedule that we're publishing shortly what the revenue will look like. It will even out as we get into next year. So you could see a little bit more top line volatility but shouldn't dramatically affect the bottom line. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets : Okay, great, that's helpful. And then just a follow up question, can we get a sense of the mix of the good new sales performance in fiscal '14 and I guess product any highlights, good or bad you mentioned and then how much of it\u2019s concentrated on new customer versus selling more to the existing base? Thank you. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets : Yeah the new, the sales performance I was talking about was really new customers. We have done a good job I think in selling more products but for the most part it's been selling new customers and I would say it\u2019s in the payroll side, the core payroll side and particularly the PEO and HR solutions, HR support products have been very strong. But across the board we really had a good year, our best in many years from a sales performance perspective and I think that's great execution on the leadership team. It's been a new leadership team really for a number of years now and Mark Bottini has come in and run all the sales, about three years ago he\u2019s built a new team, a leadership and I think it's just been, it\u2019s was just a very good execution as well as a little bit of the economy coming back slowly as well. So I think we've just gotten a better and better at the comp plans, the support tools, the leads and everything across the board. So I would say primarily strongest has probably been the core payroll and the HR solutions but really across the board it's been pretty good. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. And then just one last one the 5% sales headcount growth for fiscal '15 how is that compared to what the actual sales head count growth was in fiscal '14? Thanks a lot. Martin Mucci : Pretty modest I am going to say may be couple of percent in last year and we just thought given where we're at trying to step on accelerator a little bit. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets :  Great, thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Jim MacDonald with First Analysis. Your line is open. James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities :   Hey good morning guys. Martin Mucci : Hey Jim. James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities :   Can we talk a little more about the strategy for going self-insured, how that helps your competitiveness and how broadly it's been picked up so far? Martin Mucci : So the long and the short is that in certain markets, Jim essentially minimum premium plans where you capture liability is basically what you need to do to be competitive in that market. And as those of you who've covered the company for a while know we didn't do that in the past but thought it was important, number one, Number two, I would say that the stage of maturity of our PEO is at a point where we feel pretty comfortable about our ability to underwrite and understand that risk and obviously was discussed pretty extensively. And the third thing I would say is that we recognize that there is a nice opportunity in the PEO. We want to put ourselves in the best position to capitalize on it. James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities :   And just fine, so how many markets is it in, I mean what kind of percent take up do you expect? Martin Mucci : So the majority of our plans still are in the hands of third parties. So we are in currently with one state that's got a minimum premium plan. James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities :   Okay. And is the PEO becoming more competitive because of this, is that -- and kind of the flip side of that, is that impacting your brokerage business which was you said was flat? Martin Mucci : Well I think, you referenced it. I think it is becoming -- we really thought good about the execution of the PEO team and I think this makes us more competitive, particularly in certain markets. So we've kind of tackled this by market, as Efrain said, we're in one major market for us where a lot of the PEO sales have been and that's where we did this because we felt frankly it was more competitive, we had better flexibility to compete and there was a better opportunity for us and that the timing was really right from both internally from our execution perspective and externally from the opportunity size that\u2019s out there. The PEOs obviously have a very good opportunity and particularly with healthcare reform and so forth now thing are really picking up. So this was the right time to do it and we felt very good about managing the risk in the underwriting as well. Efrain Rivera : Yeah and Jim with respect to the insurance business let\u2019s say that there\u2019s two aspects to that. We had a super strong year on worker\u2019s comp insurance. It really -- they really did very, very well. And on H&B we anticipated that the under ten market was going to gravitate towards exchanges. That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. So client count is a little bit deceptive in that sense because that\u2019s reflective of a lot of smaller plans gravitating down where we think that will settle out. We\u2019ll get back into a pattern of better growth there because we pivoted that sales force. We made both an investment in that sales force, in numbers and also we have redirected them towards selling in the above ten employee space. James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities : And just one more, we haven\u2019t talked much about the middle market. Could you just give us an update on what you\u2019re seeing there? Martin Mucci : Yeah I think the competitive environment hasn\u2019t changed a lot, even though there has been a lot of talk about it in IPOs and so forth. We haven\u2019t seen a big change there. I think what they\u2019re looking for is exactly what we\u2019ve been working on the last few years which is the breadth of product and integration, very much a SaaS focused and we feel good about across the board, the products that we have.  I think that we like to see even more growth there but I think this is going to be a good year for us on the mid-market side I\u2019d say last year was good. It wasn\u2019t as great as we like to see but I think we were still kind of integrating all the product set but we have a very strong product set, time and attendance and HR administration online in particular is really taking up and that\u2019s why we went after the acquisition of nettime, because we felt that the opportunity for time and attendance is really big, not only in the mid-market but moving down but we thought that that was a great product and great development resources frankly to keep the product very competitive. So I\u2019d say mid-market this is going to be a good year for them and last year was good and it could be even much stronger this year. James MacDonald - First Analysis Securities : Great thanks. Martin Mucci : Okay, thanks. Operator : Next question is from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Your line is open. Martin Mucci : Hi David. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning. It sounds like you\u2019re expecting some acceleration in the HRS segment, so sorry if I missed this earlier but can you help us better understand why you\u2019re becoming more optimistic in the key segments that you think will drive that incremental growth? Martin Mucci : Well I think we\u2019re optimistic David because we had good success this year. We\u2019ve seen that the PEO has done very well, the HR solutions, the ASO model on the other side has also done well. I think what we\u2019re finding is that the opportunity for HR outsourcing has really continued to grow and we\u2019re very good at it. We\u2019ve been doing it a long time. We\u2019ve over 400 HR specialists out there handling more and more clients each. And I think we\u2019ve really got the model down extremely well, whether it\u2019s a PEO or ASO that sales force is both -- sells both products. So they look for the needs and the value to the customer and sells it that way. So I think the HR solutions frankly is just we had a stronger year than we even expected and we think that\u2019s going to continue and we may move slightly the MPP plan with the PEO to give us even greater flexibility and to capture the opportunities from a profit standpoint. So we feel very good about that and in there too is a lot of the acquisitions that we\u2019ve done, ExpenseWire, myStaffingPro, a number of products and now we\u2019re getting them integrated even more tightly with our payroll processing and I think that\u2019s all very good news for across the board. We\u2019re starting to capitalize on the investments and the acquisitions that we\u2019ve done. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And can you [lay out], a segment how much of growth this year will be acquired growth and then I guess I was also thinking perhaps the Affordable Care Act maybe at least for the moment a catalyst for small businesses to embrace an outsourced solution at least at the front end of all this as everything seems to keep changing and just looking for external support, at least again at the front end of this change. Martin Mucci : Yeah, it definitely is. It's been slower than we expected on the healthcare reform because of all the changes. We've put some very good products out early on helping you track ours, helping you tie in your time and attendance to measuring how many hours and full time equivalents and all the things that you need. And we have very good products on that side but it's gone a little slower than we expected because the government, the federal government keeps changing the dates and the rules and who it applies to and I think that's made people more cautious about deciding.  But I do think that's going to -- as we get into '15 that's going to come more and more too ahead and people will start more businesses, will make more decisions. So I do think that's a bit of a catalyst and it's been a catalyst frankly just to get in the door to talk to more prospects because they're wondering how it applies to them, do they need something or what. I also think that's going to help on the PEO in total HR outsourcing. ASO and PEO models as well because once they start making decisions on healthcare I think they are also seeking the opportunity to just outsource the HR because the compliance requirements, frankly beside healthcare there is just a ton of compliance requirement that just keep coming out by state for things that they are going to have to do. So I think that that's where we see continued opportunity there. Efrain Rivera :  And David the nettime acquisition is less than 1% of revenue and less than 1% of HRS revenues. So it\u2019s relatively modest. What we liked about it was, it is the leading SaaS time and attendance product of its type on the market. And there are not a lot of those products on the market we like the technology we would like the team and feel we're really, really well positioned in apart of the market that shows a lot of promising growth both inside or based outside it. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I see, well thanks for that. And I am wondering if I could just go back to the conversation about check growth and client growth and perhaps I've got a bit of dated view of this but my understanding has been historically that during periods of low client growth your check growth would go up because you typically add at the low end right in terms of new business creation fewer employees basically.  So I am wondering if you could help us make the connection between what has been perhaps stronger than expected check growth and relate that to what you\u2019re seeing in terms of client growth and perhaps the moderation related to better client growth next year. And then secondly, help us understand if there is any impact on pricing as the mix shifts from kind of selling more, if you will, into the existing base versus taking on new clients. Martin Mucci : Yeah, okay. So let me take a stab at the first one so I understand what you are saying so if you -- if in a given year you are adding a lot of clients that are call it under four typical new start up at 3.5 it\u2019s going to have a diluting effect on your checks per payroll. And so if you have a lot of adds you would see checks per payroll decline. That's in a steady state environment David. We're employees weren't necessarily adding a lot for employees and I think that what we didn't model very well was if you look at the last five years, no surprise we didn't add clients there for a period of time. So that did have an impact on increasing checks per client if your client base was growing. So you had a rapid acceleration of client based growth starting around 2010, I shouldn't say a client base, client employee growth that's what the data suggests. And now you've kind of leveled off a little bit more on steady state. I think when you put all that together we anticipate that cheeks per payroll are going to start dipping below 1% sometime over the next several quarters and then it won't be worth having too much of discussion on it will just be steady state and our adds on the client side will start to really dilute that, so it doesn't really become that important. So a lot of things have changed over the last seven years to kind of change that equation a bit. But I think that's fundamentally what's going on. And then I apologize because I don't remember the second part of your question. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.:   It was on pricing that, does that dynamic is client growth accelerates and checks per client decline out, that the checks isn\u2019t issue but as you do more business with newer clients how does that effect the pricing equation if at all? Martin Mucci : I think it\u2019s still the pricing, we still had pretty good pricing power. Now it\u2019s one, it\u2019s still little early to tell we need to kind of get through the first quarter to kind of give a sense of it this year but we\u2019ve really been able to stand that range the 2% to 4% range that we typically talked about our annual pricing and we\u2019re getting it on new clients, the new clients where you\u2019re in on a competitive standpoint has been pretty good. We haven\u2019t seen our discounting go up a lot on new sales. It\u2019s been fairly consistent so I think there\u2019s always competition there but and frankly if we\u2019re getting it from our referral sources then there\u2019s less competition and more just coming with us which gives us even more pricing power. So on average for new client acquisitions we haven\u2019t seen a lot of discounting go up much. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay got it. And then just lastly on the flow income, can you remind us how much of the portfolio turns over this year and the related yield compared to the reinvestment rate assumed in your guidance? Martin Mucci : Yeah okay nice, that was a very succinct way of putting a lot of pieces together. So about 15% to 20% of the long term portfolio is going to turn over this year. I think we mentioned we are at about 1.6% we probably get some more close to that. Although I always caveat that because rates have just been very volatile. So as we speak publicly in the 255 to 260 range on a ten year treasuries and we were up to 3.1 but that\u2019s a sense of what happens. And then David the other parties that were typically 45% to 50% short term. So essentially that\u2019s turning over every day and we\u2019re getting eight basis points. I think there is a disclosure in the K is that 25 basis point move is going to create about $4.5 million worth of additional income to the bottom line. So just one point not to complicate it any further but based on where you expect interest rates to be you can modify the portfolio either longer or shorter. We\u2019re staying a little bit sort of in the middle neutral at the point, at this point because we think that there -- some things are going to happen with the Fed sometime reasonably soon. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So you\u2019re saying that the embedded rate of 1.6% is relatively -- is comparable to what the reinvestment now is on the long-term? Martin Mucci : Probably a little bit higher but it doesn\u2019t really\u2026 David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And I assume you have some visibility on this, can you give us an idea of how much of the portfolio turns over in fiscal \u201916? Efrain Rivera : \u201916 is priced similar about 2015 to 20%, it\u2019s always around that range. David M. Grossman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay thanks a lot. Martin Mucci : Thanks David. Operator : Next is Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.: Thank you, good morning just a sort of a couple of questions love to hear. I was wondering just sort of give us a little bit of update on sort of a traction you\u2019re getting with SurePayroll, maybe a sense for what the customer growth was on the SurePayroll this year and what\u2019s your sort of expectations is for industry growth how that sort of SaaS industry, what kind of traction the industry is growing out at this point and how you sort of did relative to the industry? Martin Mucci : Yeah Glenn, of course we don\u2019t break it out any more but we\u2019ve been very happy with their growth. Their sales have been very strong, retention has been good, and they\u2019ve continued to build partnerships as we have with banks, with referrals and so forth in banks for their white label product which we actually go into the banks now and have been very successful going in together. So either you want to give referrals to us or you white label a SurePayroll product of a number of banks. So we\u2019re very pleased with it. We don\u2019t want to break the growth out because it\u2019s becoming more and more of integrated part of us but we\u2019re very pleased with their growth and they\u2019ve reached some nice milestones this year. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.: And then on the margins the 37% to 38% guide for \u201915, down a little bit from this year and I think Efrain you talked about a few things like the investment, sales growth of 5%. The other thing would be the reporting change the change in the insurance reporting is that a meaningful drag or not to significant or anything else we should be thinking about as relates to the margins? Efrain Rivera : Yeah Glenn, If I wish I could just have a -- one thing, when we put out the press release we couldn't to my -- in deference to my good friends on the West Coast we release before so they get -- they don't have to get up at 7. We probably in the future would just simply release a day up because a lot of notes just had it wrong. You need to see the schedule. So the point you are making is a very valid point. The reason why the margins are down is because of the reclassification on the PEO cost. We\u2019re still continuing to leverage. During next year it's going to appear lumpy until we get close to Q4 and then it starts to normalize. So the answer is no, our margin isn't deteriorating. It's simply the reclassification of these costs. Please if I can\u2026 Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.: Can you quantify that, there might just be simple -- we'll see the schedules but is that 50 basis points or something like that? Efrain Rivera : Yeah you are looking at a quantification of about 100 to 150 basis points. But it would be pretty explicitly stated on the schedule. And I wish I could just put it all out but it was just going to be too confusing. So and for those of you who have any questions whatsoever please give me a call or have one of your associates give me a call and I\u2019ll walking them through that if you have any confusion on it at all. And look at -- I can't, we can't have a pre-call to say we had a change in terms of the way we did the accounting, but thanks for asking the question. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.: Yeah and just one more on the share repurchase, you renewed obviously upped the authorization in May, but would you think it would be sort of sustained at the same level of appetite to repurchase shares this year as relative to fiscal '14? And should we see a benefit on the share count going down more so than in '14? Martin Mucci : No, I would say we're just going to keep it relatively flat and purchase to offset dilution at this point, if we make a change there we'll chat with you. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Martin Mucci : Sure. Operator : Next is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeffrey Silber - BMO Capital Markets : Thanks so much, I know it\u2019s late, I\u2019ll just ask last one quick one. Looking at the client growth acceleration in payroll services, were there any types of clients where you saw faster growth may be you focused a little bit more on your sales effort there? Martin Mucci : No, I would say across the board we had pretty good growth there. And really one of the things we forget that we still have an Advantage Payroll base that we purchased back in 2003 that we haven\u2019t really been selling, continuing to sell in that market. That drops off, that continues to just kind of drop off because we're not selling new but across the board, whether it's the SurePayroll core payroll, et cetera, international we've kind of had nice, pretty good growth, some ups and downs but pretty good growth across the board. Jeffrey Silber - BMO Capital Markets : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Martin Mucci : You're welcome. Operator : Next is from George Mihalos with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. George Mihalos - Credit Suisse :  Hey guys, most of my questions have been answered but just quickly if we look at the outlook for HSR revenue growth, the 11% to 14% on adjusted basis, that compares to the 11.5 that you did last year. Is all the acceleration on attachment of ACA related products that could potentially kick in? Martin Mucci : No, it's not. It's basically George it's really just strength in the HR solutions portion of the business and also the other products that we sell. Efrain Rivera : It's across the board but you will see the biggest growth part of that is still going to continue to be the PEO and HR outsourcing business. But 401(k) continues to grow and across the board in insurance and so forth. George Mihalos - Credit Suisse : Okay. Should we be thinking that growth would be a little bit more backend loaded throughout the course of the year or fairly uniform? Efrain Rivera : It's a little bit, George what I would suggest is you look at the schedule because you will see while if you look at our EPS, between first half and second half, there is not a huge amount of difference for the implied EPS, what you can see the growth is a little bit more back half weighted. George Mihalos - Credit Suisse : Okay, thank you. Operator : Next is from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan: Hey, thanks good morning. Hey, good morning, thanks for taking my question, just on the -- I want to ask about float income growth it seems conservative at flat given what you showed in the fourth quarter and how you did better than you said last year. Anything unusual there I caught the rate commentary you gave to Dave, I thought fund balances would help you could get to positive. Efrain Rivera : Yeah we could get to positive. I think what we're -- what's happening is every quarter when we reinvest we're looking at a different interest rate scenario. And I would say we looked at four different interest rate scenarios last year meaning that what we saw in the market differed every quarter and so we have to make a decision in that quarter, do we go long or do we go short. And our bias now is to stay a little shorter because we think that longer we\u2019re going to see a pop, that\u2019s where we\u2019re at, that\u2019s what the guidance implies. Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan: Understood okay. So obviously that will be fluid and we\u2019ll get updates as we go, makes sense. Then just one more clarification, just I know there\u2019s a lot of talk about PEO, how does the mix shift to PEO if that\u2019s indeed what\u2019s happening, how does that impact your payroll service revenue at all and does it impact your payroll client account because I'm not sure how those things get treated if you follow my question. Efrain Rivera : Yeah good question, so if we add PEO clients they are included within our payroll client number, I would say the numbers weren\u2019t big, so don\u2019t think that what was driving it was PEO. But I think I\u2019ll just use that question to highlight something important people think of Paychex as or typically have thought of Paychex as sub payroll and attach ancillaries and what\u2019s increasingly occurring company as you know the way that we capture our client can be through a PEO sometimes when we attach payroll after an HR sale. It\u2019s the breadth of offerings and that breadth of offerings combined with mobile technology that pulls all of that information together that I think uniquely positions us in the market. So going in through one single sign on, which virtually no one has through one integrated suite of products or of one database which is what we\u2019ve been doing from one investment standpoint permits to you enter either through the PEO through the ASO through a 401(k) and go back into payroll to I think we\u2019re really uniquely positioned there so the sales are occurring in a lot of different ways. Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan: Understood, it\u2019s very clear, as long as we can invest, thanks. Martin Mucci : Great thanks. Operator : Next is Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird: Thanks. Good morning, how large is the sales force now? Martin Mucci : I think we are over on the feet on the street over 2,600. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird: Over 2,600 and how many are running a typical quota? In terms of what you used to be targeted back in, prior to the recession? Martin Mucci : Last year a lot of them, remember that typical quota is going to vary by product but if you look at the core I would say we did very well last year. Efrain Rivera : Yeah I don\u2019t think we typically have broken that out or anything so. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird: We talked around the edges to see if we could kind of get to it. So it sounds like we have enough that are running at that level, that really doesn\u2019t necessitate an increase in terms of the sales force. Martin Mucci : Oh yeah I think and we definitely as you know Mark, we\u2019ve kind kept that on a low side of ads and then as we saw more productivity and we saw the execution across the board and the opportunity I think growing now is the time to add the additional reps in various areas so\u2026 Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird: Great and then with regards to major markets how should we think about that particularly given some of the discussions. Isn\u2019t that an area where we are going to be investing a little bit more? Martin Mucci : Yeah we continue to invest. It\u2019s hand good investment. Now the interesting thing is that that investment really spreads across when I would say years ago hey these time and attendance offerings for example or HR online offerings are for the 50 plus it really has come down quite dramatically and so we don\u2019t, we think of the investments frankly is almost the entire base anymore maybe not under five or under 10 or some, but definitely under 20 you\u2019re selling time and attendance solutions whether it\u2019s our simple time clocks or whether it\u2019s the new solutions they are selling a lot more broadly.  So you kind of start with the over 50 but you\u2019re definitely seeing it all come down. The needs are deafening and there is some, it\u2019s because of the simplicity the integration of the SaaS and the adoption is really taking it much, much further down market. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird: How are you thinking about the upper end what you\u2019ve traditionally targeted with regards to majors? Martin Mucci : I think we\u2019re still, I think we\u2019re doing well there and you\u2019ll continue to see that the investments we\u2019re making will help us and I\u2019ll say 250 to 500 range, as well. I think we\u2019re competitive there but certainly our focus and majority of the client base has been lower and we\u2019ll continue the things we\u2019re investing in, will continue to help make us very competitive on a 250 to 1,000 but I would say primarily 250 to 500 to 600 to 700 we do very well there. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird: Okay great and then so just going back to the margins .So if we were to adjust this past fiscal year under where would the margins have been? Efrain Rivera : Yeah the margins would have been between 38 to 39. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird: I'm sorry, I meant fiscal \u201914 which just ended. Martin Mucci : Yes. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird: If we wouldn\u2019t apply a similar treatment to what you\u2019re going to do prospectively? Martin Mucci : Prospectively UG market to be a 50 to a 100 basis points higher. So let me explain because at this time which is deafening. This year we clogged out our margins were approximately where they were between 38 and 39 about 38.7, 38.6, by applying the same logic so I'm not inflating the top line with the -- not inflating us not there, I'm not grossing up the top line, it be between 50 to 100 basis points higher in prospectively. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird: Okay so in other words if we take a look exclusive of float, you basically been running incremental margins north of 50% for two years now. What you basically say if I'm interpreting things correctly despite the increased investments behind the sales force and technology the leverage is still there other than this change and so the reality is we\u2019d still see incremental margins that would be in the similar range? Martin Mucci : That\u2019s correct Mark and put another way, this year\u2019s going to be lumpy and choppy because we\u2019ve got these additions to revenue. By the end of the fourth quarter and by the way I\u2019ll just repeat for those who are still here on the call, there is a schedule, hopefully it\u2019s out by now on the website that details this and helps you really refine the model. By the time we get to the end of the, by the time we get to the end of \u201915 you\u2019ll see that margins start to normalize. But we\u2019re doing it on a higher level of revenue you can\u2019t get even to the lows of the margin that we\u2019re talking about if we weren\u2019t leveraging so there is leveraging the model I guess and we will continue to do that. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird: And is there an anticipation that in the first quarter of next year or in the third quarter of next year the add that we had for this treatment that we would end up seeing higher adds in other words\u2026 Martin Mucci : No, it actually levels out. Mark what I would suggest is look at the schedule and you\u2019ll see it and we\u2019ll talk about it in detail, but the first two quarters are where you see the most of the revenue add, third you see some and then by fourth it really diminishes. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird: Just out of curiosity why wouldn\u2019t you just, within your next press release just and at least until things level out just include a paragraph where it\u2019s like if we had treated things in a similar manner? Martin Mucci : Yes, that\u2019s good feedback, we may do that. By the way it is in our current press release. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird: I know I appreciate it. That made it a lot easier, okay. Efrain Rivera : We will continue to do it. Martin Mucci : Yeah we\u2019ll take a look. Because the biggest thing that Efrain mentioned was the margin really it\u2019s probably the one thing that\u2019s been misunderstood. It didn\u2019t go down 100 basis points or so it\u2019s -- we have not gone down on margin it just brings more revenue up in the top line. Efrain Rivera : Mark we\u2019ll either put it in or I\u2019ll just talk to it. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird: Because I mean if somebody is just going through the math and is making an adjustment to say the last quarter the way it look is if we make that adjustment the 37 to 38 that\u2019s been guided to doesn\u2019t seem to imply any sort of margin improvement, which would imply that your incremental margins are going down which is something that you\u2019re not which is clearly not going to be the case. Efrain Rivera : Yeah but again what I would say is look at our supplemental schedule that we\u2019re posting because you can\u2019t understand the numbers without understanding, how much in each quarter we\u2019re adding revenue by this change. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird: Great thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay thanks Mark. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Your line is open. Michael Baker - Raymond James : Yeah I just wanted on the new health insurance offering understand if like in fiscal \u201916 could we continue to see some impact as you potentially rollout to more markets or is this just kind of a one year impact? Martin Mucci : Well I think you\u2019re saying on the PEO piece of this right, when you say insurance offering. Michael Baker - Raymond James : Yes. Martin Mucci : I think it\u2019s something we continue to look at. Right now we have one plan in a major area of our PEO and we\u2019ll continue to look at this from a competitive and opportunity competitive nature and opportunity perspective and there could be more which would -- could produce more changes and if that\u2019s the case then we\u2019ll go through this. We\u2019ll probably get even better at refining exactly what the impact is but it could, at this point we don\u2019t plan on it but we continue to look at our markets and find that if it makes sense to do more we\u2019ll do more. Michael Baker - Raymond James : Okay and in the market where it exists can you give us the underlying healthcare cost trend assumption that you\u2019re using for the product? Martin Mucci : No, but it\u2019s probably close to national averages. Michael Baker - Raymond James : Okay I appreciate it, thanks for the color. Martin Mucci : One other thing I want to say just to refine that, that underlying cost trend is going to be a function of your ability to underwrite the people in pools. So if you\u2019re good, you hopefully can beat that trend by getting the right people in your pool. So that\u2019s all subject to a little bit of managerial effort. Michael Baker - Raymond James : Right and just to that point though, you could actually see what we call favorable trend as well in other words people are kind of more focused on the risk side of it but periodically at least within the year you could experience favorable trend and then factor that into your pricing next years -. Martin Mucci : You cover the PEO, it\u2019s part of the strategy that you use in the PEO. Michael Baker - Raymond James : Right I guess the other concern that\u2019s out there is that because we see what can happen to the pure play to self-insure. There was just kind of that element of uncertainty there. Is there any potential down the road to like you do for interest rates give at least some sense and I know there are other pieces because you have what we call stop loss or some form of app on it, just to kind of ease some of that because normally what happens is the concerns tend to creep up what we call back half of the year given some of the -- and not when I mean back half of the year I mean calendar year. Martin Mucci : Definitely I know what you\u2019re saying, so yeah I think we\u2019ll call that out. Subject to -- there are certain competitors in the market and we look at -- we try to level at the disclosures we provide, no one else is doing so we don\u2019t most assured, we see some trend changes we\u2019ll talk about it. Michael Baker - Raymond James : All right thanks. Operator : Thank you. Tim McHugh with William Blair. Your line is open. Martin Mucci : Hi Tim. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning, it\u2019s actually [Stephen Sheldon] [ph] in for Tim. Just wanted to clarify is the 5% sales force growth expectation is that for core payroll or is that for overall sales force payroll? Martin Mucci : It\u2019s for overall. Unidentified Analyst : Okay and then I think you said that acquisitions would add less than a 100 basis points overall revenue growth in 2015 but just wanted to ask is there any assumed impact from acquisitions on your margin guidance? Martin Mucci : It has a slight negative impact but again I didn\u2019t call out either because frankly there are surrounding areas. Unidentified Analyst : Okay thanks. Operator : Thank you and our last question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is open. Martin Mucci : Hey, Ashwin. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup: Hey guys, thank you keeping this open so long. Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to ask and I hopped off the call for brief bit so I apologize if this was asked. Do you have any clarity on the number of processing days in each quarter for this fiscal year? Because I know that last year it kind of created some ups and downs? Martin Mucci : Yeah it created noise. I could have done a better job on that one, but yeah the exact same days, so there\u2019s no date changes. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup: So on a year-over-year basis just to clarify its going to be the same days each quarter? Martin Mucci : Yeah, same days each quarter. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup: Got it, okay well that was the only clarification I had I just want to say happy 4th to you. Martin Mucci : Yeah same to you and everyone else on the call. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup: Thanks. Operator : I am showing no further questions. Martin Mucci : Great at this point we will close the call. We appreciate your participation. If you\u2019re interested in replaying the webcast it will be archived until August 4th. Thank you for your interest in Paychex and again your participation in our fiscal 2014 year-end conference call. Have a great summer. We\u2019ll look forward to talking to you next quarter and have a great holiday weekend coming up. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude the conference.

If you have any objections please disconnect at this time.  I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin. Martin Mucci : Good morning, thank you. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex's first quarter of fiscal 2015 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2014. Our earnings release and Form 10-Q will be available on our Investor Relations page at Paychex.com. This teleconference will also be broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month. On today\u2019s call I will review the highlights for the first quarter of our sales, operations and product development areas and Efrain will review our first quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance; then we\u2019ll open it up for your questions.  We are off to a good start in fiscal 2015. We are pleased with our progress toward our growth goals and we begin the year with momentum in both sales and new product enhancements. Client satisfaction and retention also remain at high levels.  Payroll revenue is trending well with growth of about 4.5% due to increases in revenue per check, client base and checks per payroll. HRS revenue grew double-digits for the first quarter as we continue to experience success in selling HR outsourcing solutions to our clients. Total service revenue grew 9%. The positive momentum we saw in fiscal 2014 in sales execution has continued into 2015 as we experience solid performance in both new sales revenue and units. Our payroll and Paychex HR services in particular continue to do well in Q1.  We also quickly brought onboard the increase in sales reps we planned, so that we are fully staffed and have been successful in adding new bank and franchise referral arrangements in addition to our strong CPA referral channel.  Our partnership between our selling organizations has never been more efficient as they have moved down market to be sure our clients are receiving the full value of the breadth of services that Paychex has to offer them.  Our execution and service operations has continued its standard of excellence, demonstrated by strong client satisfaction results and client retention levels that remain consistent with recent highs. Our innovative leading edge technology in products, coupled with our exceptional client service we believe is a differentiator in the market. From a technology perspective, continued investment in our SaaS solutions and mobility offerings position us for long-term growth. We have market-leading software-as-a-service solutions leveraging the latest technologies and continue to invest significantly in online capabilities and mobile applications. We recently introduced mobile applications for both our Paychex online accounting services and our expense management solutions. In addition, our online payroll application was recently awarded a five star rating by a leading publication, the only major payroll provider to receive such a rating. We completed the acquisition of nettime solutions, a leading cloud-based time and attendance solution provider, adding yet another powerful offering to our software-as-a-service portfolio. This acquisition pairs Paychex exceptional customer service and on boarding team with the SaaS time and attendance technology of a market leader. In summary, we are off to a solid start for sales, service, product strength and financial performance for fiscal 2015 and I greatly appreciate the work of our Paychex employee team across the country. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain. Efrain Rivera : Thanks Marty and good morning. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that in today\u2019s conference call we'll make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and in such involve risks. Refer to the press release for a discussion of forward-looking statements and related risk factors.  You may remember that during the latter part of last year we introduced a new health insurance offering within our PEO for PEO clients and work side employees. Due to the self-insurance provisions within the new offering, we began classifying certain PEO direct costs as operating expenses rather than a reduction in service revenue. This change had no impact on operating income. This new product offering had an impact on our first quarter results, since it was not initiated until the second half of fiscal 2014. As Marty indicated, our first quarter financial results for fiscal 2015 represent a strong start to the year. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter. I will provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of our outlook. Total service revenue grew 9% for the first quarter to $657 million. Interest on funds held for clients increased 2% for the first quarter to $10 million. This was driven by a 3% increase in average investment balances and as I\u2019ve discussed with some of you, we are getting to the point where we bottom down in terms of decreases on our interest related to our client fund portfolio.  The expenses increased 12% for the first quarter, but this was primarily in compensation related costs and the PEO direct costs. The increase in the portion of PEO direct costs is the result of a healthcare offering as I mentioned previously.  The increase in compensation-related cost was driven by higher performance-based compensation costs, employee benefit related costs and the sales headcount. We talked a bit about our increase in sales headcount. We are up year-over-year in sales headcount. We continued our investment in our product development and supporting technology, which has been growing at a faster rate than our total expenses. Operating income net of certain items increased 5% to $257 million for the quarter. We maintained strong operating margins and anticipate that our full year will be within our guidance range, which I\u2019ll discuss shortly. Diluted earnings per share increased 7% to $0.47 per share for the quarter and net income increased 5% to $171 million. Diluted earnings per share were positively impacted by stock repurchases we made in the first quarter and in fiscal 2014.  On the payroll revenue side, service revenue exceeded 4% for the first quarter to $413 million. We benefited from the increases in revenue per check, client base and checks per payroll and I got a \u2013 I saw a note that indicated what were checks per payroll and we didn\u2019t call it out specifically. It was about 1% as we drift in that range or slightly below and we won\u2019t call it out specifically, so check per payroll up about 1%. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases, net of discounting along with the impact of increased product penetration and as I mentioned, checks per payroll are growing, but at a more moderate rate as we are expecting.  On the HRS side, HR service revenue increased 17% to $244 million for the first quarter. The increase reflects strong growth in both clients and work site employees of Paychex HR services and an increase in PEO revenue as a result of the new minimum premium healthcare offerings started during the second half of last year.  The increase from the new PEO healthcare offering represents approximately 2.5% of total service revenue for the first quarter, so just so you hear that again, the increase from the new PEO healthcare offering represents approximately 2.5% of total service revenue for the first quarter. Online HR administration products contribute to growth through sales, success of our SaaS solutions and retirement services revenue benefited from an increase in the number of plans and an increase in average asset value of participant funds. Turning to the investment portfolio, our goal as you know is to protect principle and optimize liquidity. We are conservative in the way we manage our portfolio on the short-term side. Primary investment vehicles are bank demand deposit accounts and if you look at the balance sheet, you\u2019ll see that we had a fair amount of cash in the quarter. That\u2019s because of timing and we didn\u2019t choose to invest all of that in VRDN\u2019s in Q1. In our longer portfolio we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.6% and an average duration of 3.3 years. I would just say that we are positioned where we want to be, to take advantage of rising interest rates should they come at some point soon hopefully. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.1% for the first quarter, compared to 1.0% for the same period last year. That\u2019s the first time in a while we said the compare is positive.  Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased during the first quarter. This was driven by wage inflation, along with favorable trends in our client base and checks per payroll.  I'll now walk you through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $956 million and no debt. Funds held for clients were $4.1 billion compared to $4.2 billion as of May 31, 2014. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.6 billion for the quarter; the more relevant comparison. That\u2019s a year-over-year increase of 3%.  Total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains on the portfolio of $41 million as of August 31, 2014, compared with a net unrealized gain of $35 million as of May 31, 2014.  Total stockholders equity was $1.8 billion, reflecting $138 million in dividend paid during the first quarter and $38 million of shares repurchase. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 35%.  Cash flows from operations were $263 million for the first quarter, which moderated from the prior year. The change was a result of fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities offset by higher net income and non-cash adjustments to net income.  The fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation, PEO payroll and income taxes. It really was primarily as a result of timing of a large income tax payment we made in the year prior period. It is common for us to have some significant fluctuations of working capital between quarters. With respect to guidance, we reaffirmed our guidance for fiscal 2015. I\u2019d like to remind you that our outlook is based upon our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Total service revenue as we previously said is anticipated to be in the range of 8% to 10% with the ranges for payroll and HR as consistent with previous guidance. Net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 6% to 8% and operating margin and tax rate for the year are expected to be consistent with prior guidance. And I\u2019ll turn it back to Marty. Martin Mucci : Okay. We will now open the call to any questions. Operator. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). The first question today is from George Mihalos with Credit Suisse. George Mihalos - Credit Suisse : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and a very nice start to the year. Martin Mucci : Thank you. George Mihalos - Credit Suisse : I wanted to kick it of on the payroll growth side, a 4.5% number sort of at the high end of your 3% to 5% range. Just curious, is there any reason why you wouldn\u2019t be narrowing the range say to 4% to 5% from the 3% to 5% and the 3% seems conservative, even if we are only in the first quarter. Just wondering if you are seeing anything else there? Martin Mucci : Yes, George thanks. So I guess it\u2019s a philosophy issues. Sorry, I should state what the philosophy is. What we try to do when we come into the year is say, what do we think the ranges are for the year as a whole, so we don\u2019t have to revise every quarter guidance. We try to call out, if somehow a quarter falls, is a little bit unusual in terms of the guidance. So yes, I would say at the bottom end, right now 3% is pretty conservative. We obviously start a little bit better than that number, but we still feel comfortable with the overall guidance range. George Mihalos - Credit Suisse : Okay great, thanks for the color there. And then wanted to switch gears as it relates to your payroll card program or initiative, the partnership with Skylight that you have. Any color you can provide there as to demand for payroll cards and just wanted to get a sense, is a payroll card more profitable to Paychex than a standard check? Martin Mucci : Yes, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s more profitable. It\u2019s not necessarily more profitable, because we have a partner obviously involved in providing it. I\u2019d say the demand for it George has been consistent, but not huge. I think we were one of the first to have a payroll card, meant (ph) over 10 years ago and it just \u2013 it has a small kind of grouping; those that are on bank for example and so forth.  And while we\u2019ve seen that go up and down a little bit over time, more and more people want one card if they are bank. They want one card, they don\u2019t want a separate payroll card, so I would say that the demand is consistent. We really like the product that we are involved with now and think that that may pick up demand a little bit, but it\u2019s one of those things where we just like to offer a full wide range of offerings to the client as to however they want to receive their pay. George Mihalos - Credit Suisse : Okay, great. Thanks. Martin Mucci : Okay. Efrain Rivera : Thanks George. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from S.K. Prasad Borra with Goldman Sachs. S.K. Prasad Borra \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Thanks for taking my question. Just with regards to your investments in sales force, when do you expect to see the benefits come through? Is it more second half weighted or we should start seeing movements in the first half as well? Martin Mucci : Yes, as I said, I think we got off to a good start. I think the new headcount that we\u2019ve added in the last quarter, I think you\u2019ll see more of those benefits in the second half of the year. We have a great training program, but obviously they get trained. They start building their relationships with CPA\u2019s and other channels and I think you\u2019ll see that more in the second half of the year. But we feel like we are off to a very good start. We continued in from Q4 and feel good about both sales units and revenue from the perspective particularly of payroll. S.K. Prasad Borra \u2013 Goldman Sachs : And probably just to follow-on on that. What\u2019s the split between the sales force recruitment in payroll and HRS segments? Martin Mucci : As far as what the additions were? S.K. Prasad Borra \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Yes. Martin Mucci : The additions were a little stronger on the payroll side. We felt that that was starting to pick up again in the second half of last year and so much of the ads \u2013 I won\u2019t break it out exactly, but much of the ads were on the payroll side and because we felt we are very well positioned on the HRS services side. S.K. Prasad Borra \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Thanks for taking my question. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Smitty Srethapramote with Morgan Stanley. Smitty Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley : Great, thank you. Just wanted to just get some more color on the PEO segment. How it\u2019s tracking and may be you can give us an update in terms of how pricing is developing on the PEO side? Martin Mucci :   I would say we thought really strong about the last half of the year from a competitive standpoint where we feel very competitive. They\u2019ve done very well with the carriers. The new plan as Efrain mentioned, we think has put us in an even better competitive position in the Florida area and so we feel very good we are off to a \u2013 the big months are kind of coming in now this quarter is what\u2019s coming up for the benefit plans and so forth, but we feel very strong fully staffed on the sales side, a lot of experience in that team and of course we offer both the PEO and the ASO version.  So what\u2019s good about the way I believe we offered it is, whatever the client needs to get the most value out of the service we have to offer him. But feel very good about the PEO side and our opportunity you are coming up particularly this second quarter as we see benefit plans get subscribed too. Efrain Rivera : Yes, I\u2019d just add Pramod that we are positioned certainly in the market as well as we\u2019ve ever been positioned. The addition to the minimum premium plan really helps in Florida, but we are seeing good demand across other markets. So the only caution or caveat I'd put on that is that third quarter is a big quarter for PEO and that\u2019s where you see kind of how much you are winning the battle. So we feel good about where we started. Still the year needs to play out a bit more. Smitty Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley : Got it. And may be just a follow up on nettimes solutions. Can you just give us some more color in terms of the level of traction that you are getting with that new offering and may be compare that to your legacy T&E product. And are there any other product sets that you are looking to buy or to build or buy to improve your overall product portfolio at the movement? Martin Mucci : Yes, right now we are feeling very good about the portfolio of products. The nettime was an opportunity that we felt we had a \u2013 there was a real market leader there and that the team would fit very well and would fit into our SaaS products.  We are seeing good traction really out of the gate as we integrate it into our payroll offering, which will come in stages and then there is organic growth that we\u2019ve continued at nettime itself. So we feel good about the organic growth, which they\u2019ll sell directly and integrating it into our payroll platform. We\u2019ve already had a number of sales. We are training everyone in our team on the product and so you\u2019ll see a good combination of sales from the organic and to tie into Paychex. The integration takes a little bit of time, but that will be coming up in the next quarter or so. So we are very pleased with the product. The whole management team is in place at nettime. Our leadership is taking a very strong role and is just a great cultural fit with the company, so we feel very good about where this is.  The legacy product has been very strong. We had a good strong year last year and we\u2019ll just kind of phase. The legacy product has little more for us integrated bells and whistles on it, which we are introducing actually even this quarter and next year. You\u2019ll see not only web-punch online, but complete mobility punch as well, time punches and so we\u2019ll still be building on the legacy product for a little bit until we get nettime fully integrated in, but we are really pleased with the product and everything that it offers. Efrain Rivera : They had a really nice track record of growing that business over 60% over the last three years and it\u2019s a good example of the kind of acquisitions. We like smaller. We buy them to grow them, not for growth and good products set, good management and they are off to a good start. Smitty Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley : Thanks for that. And may be just one last quick question is, as you can give us an update on the retention ratio, the retention rate that you are seeing in your business. Martin Mucci : Yes, very similar to last year, we are really ahead from our perspective on retention, so very strong. It\u2019s probably still at historic best for the company from a payroll retention stand point and we feel very good. So not only the sales have great momentum, but the retention is right up there with our historic best and we haven\u2019t seen any change in that. Obviously big quarter is coming up here with year-end, but so far we are feeling very good about the retention. Smitty Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley : Great. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies: Hi guys, thanks. I wanted to just ask a little bit about new business formation. Get some general observation from you guys on whether you think we are stable or is there any improvement there, I know its obviously an important source of new sales and growth for Paychex? Efrain Rivera : Yes, so Jason two answers to that. It would be greater if we had real time data on what\u2019s going on in the economy in the absence of that. We\u2019ve noticed a trend ticking up on our sales to newly formed businesses and it seems like over a number of quarters now we seem to be picking up in that area and if you go back a couple of years ago, we weren\u2019t seen that trend. That now seems to be evident. It looks like you getting better business formation, but of course we are kind of an indirect, our observation on that is indirect, our sales to new businesses are up. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies: Okay. Is there any way to get a feel, either qualitatively or quantitatively whether or not that\u2019s reflective of any kind of share shift in terms of who is winning new businesses or is it not enough data to really call that out. Efrain Rivera : Yes, there really isn\u2019t enough data to pull it out. Its very difficult to get that granular for new business sales, and I would tend to describe it a little bit more to some underlying growth in new businesses and then I think we are getting better at execution too. Martin Mucci : Yes, I think we have felt good about kind of the win loss ratio against competitors, that we are definitely seeing an up-tick in the sales from competitors and kind of when we look at it from a net gain from competitors and we are definitely an up-tick and a positive at this point as we started to see that the second half of last year too.  So well Efrain\u2019s right, its quite hard. We are still not at the full new business, a creation that we were pre-recession. Its certainly up, but it\u2019s not where it was based on everything we see. But as Efrain said, new sales, sales to new businesses are up and definitely the gain from competitors is up. So we are feeling very good about that. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies: Okay. And then just on pricing, are you still kind of trending closer to the lower end of 2% to 4% range and I wanted to just gets a feel in terms of contract renewals in general, what percent of those are currently being done with the unit price increase versus how many are flat and how many have a unit price decrease and has there been any change in those relative percentages over the past, I don\u2019t know a year or so? Efrain Rivera : Yes, so Jason so what we said is 2% to 4% I would say we are floating off the bottom of that a little bit closer to the middle of it. We do not give uniform price increases, so that\u2019s experienced a little bit differently by different customers and we also don\u2019t have contracts.  So one of the things that does differentiate us is that virtual across every single customer that we have, if you don\u2019t earn our keep from a service standpoint, you can get to walk without penalties. We do a little bit of that in the mid market, but that\u2019s a relative small part of our business. So I would say the pricing environment is easing somewhat. Martin Mucci : Yes, we feel good about it you know. Now that we\u2019re through that first quarter, we have not seen a lot of fallout from the price increase and so that\u2019s always a good determining factor in that first quarter, although we would see it typically in the July, August timeframe and haven\u2019t, so\u2026 Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies: Okay. Just my last question, any update you wanted to provide on the Brazil, JV or what\u2019s happening overseas in Germany and your kind of processing offering as well. Martin Mucci : Yes, I\u2019d say Brazil is off to a good start. There was a delay in some of the electronic filing requirements that we had expected the government had put in place, they delayed for year, but we are off to a pretty good start. We don\u2019t give exact client growth, but we feel very good about the start that we\u2019ve had there since January and in Germany sales are above plans. So they are continuing to do well and we are always looking for other ways to grow Germany even faster and the other, Brazil as well. Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies: Okay. I appreciate the comments. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : Hey, good morning Marty and Efrain. Efrain as you look at the results that you reported for the first quarter, would you say were they in line with your internal plans or were you a little bit a head of internal plans? Efrain Rivera : Crickets right. We felt pretty good about the first quarter. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research :  Alright, so Efrain the balance sheet looks amazing still, you have a lot of cash on hand. Any thoughts as to what you would like to do with that cash. I know you have a share buy back in place and just beyond that? Efrain Rivera : Yes so we do have an opportunity to buy shares back. We have bought to-date, including last year about 7 million shares that we purchased those significantly below where the stock is trading. We obviously thought that made a lot of sense where we see opportunities to go and buy. We will do that opportunistically, we think that makes sense.  But the other thing is we have a good pipeline of acquisition opportunities. We want to keep our powder dry. We are as all of you know, we don\u2019t tend to do stupid acquisitions just to grow and we like some properties out there. Now, whether there\u2019s going to be something that we see over the course of the year, we\u2019ll evaluate that and if we are getting to the end of the year and we have a significant cash build up, then we\u2019ll have to have a discussion with the board about what next steps would be there. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : And then Marty just on the Paychex accounting online business, how its progressing, where you are, if you think you need to change the business model at all. Martin Mucci : Well, I think the biggest thing we are learning is how to really acquire the clients and kind of get them, and I guess I\u2019ll even step back further, get them to even to realize it\u2019s a great accounting product that we have invested in with Kashoo and this has been out there for a while. It\u2019s a strong online accounting product. More of a book keeping type of software as a service, but they still come to Paychex for payroll benefits and outsourcing and while the reputation is very strong there, they are not always \u2013 it\u2019s a different marketing game to teach them about the accounting or bookkeeping online that we have available to them. So I think the biggest thing, I wouldn\u2019t really change much. We may get a little more aggressive as far as getting to our own clients and in getting them to understand that we have this nice offering that I think is going to be a real benefit and value to them. So probably more from a market standpoint, we are trying to see if we can get the knowledge that its out there and that its us and that it has all the power, the strength of Paychex behind it, that\u2019s the biggest thing.  Other than that, we are really pleased with the product. I think we are just finding that the marketing is a little bit different in the approach and so forth and we expect that to start to pick up. Kartik Mehta - Northcoast Research : Hey, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Joe Foresi with Janney Capital Markets. Martin Mucci : Hi Joe. Jeff Rossetti - Janney Capital Markets : Hi, good morning. This is Jeff Rossetti in for Joe. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to see if I could get an update on the sales force hiring. I know you were targeting 5% growth on the sales force hires for the year. Just wanted to see how Q1 shook out. Martin Mucci : Yes, I\u2019m not sure if \u2013 yes, that was confusing. We are probably more in like the 3% type of growth rate and we felt very good about that. We\u2019ve been fairly flat the last few years. Didn\u2019t grow a lot in the sales force given the economy and some of the results and things that we were doing in sales. And this year we decided, we committed to a good strong 3% growth and that all got completed very quickly. So we hired up between the fourth quarter and the first quarter and we are fully staffed. A lot of training has already been done and I think they are hitting the ground running.  So I feel very good about that. We really haven\u2019t put \u2013 we\u2019ve been more cautious the last couple of years. This year we started getting back to the kind of old trends of adding 2% to 3% to the sales force in the year. Efrain Rivera : Just Jeff one other add to that. While as Marty said we are going to add 3%, we are actually up over that when you compare where we were in the Q1 of last year. We came in a little light last year and Q1 started the year, built up and then added 3%. So we are actually above the 3%. Jeff Rossetti - Janney Capital Markets : Okay, great. And I know last quarter you had called out some increased investment in the first half of the fiscal year. You were above your operating margin guided range in the first quarter. Is there any kind of push out on your increased investment on the IT side or sales force like heading into Q2? Efrain Rivera : As Marty said, I think we did a lot of the hiring we were going do on the sales force in Q1. IT will ramp a bit as we progress through the year. So I don\u2019t think we are way off what we were expecting. Jeff Rossetti - Janney Capital Markets : Okay, thanks. And one final question just on \u2013 I know its been, we have discussed kind of delayed decisions on the healthcare reform side. Just wanted to see if there was any update on that. If clients are addressing compliance requirements. Thanks. Martin Mucci : I think you know Jeff we are still get a lot of interest. It gets us in front of a lot of clients, but I think that this quarter we\u2019ll get a better sense of it again as the benefit plans. People come up, some are getting off exchanges, some of the small clients are going to be moving to the exchanges. I think we\u2019ll get a better sense. I think we\u2019ve still seen kind of a, I wouldn\u2019t say a freeze, but kind of a hesitation to know what to do and of course the delay in some of the requirements for the 50 to 99, the under 100, 50 to 100 basically has pushed off that decision for a few more.  We still feel okay. We got a very strong health insurance team out there and they are getting in front of a lot of clients, but you are still seeing a little bit of hesitation I think. Got great products to help them monitor whether it applies to them, how it applies to them, give them real time information, but we are not seeing a big up-tick, at least at this point, but we do expect it will probably pick up a little bit more in the next few months. Jeff Rossetti - Janney Capital Markets : Thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from David Togut with Evercore. Martin Mucci : Hey David. David Togut - Evercore Partners : Thank you. Good morning Marty and Efrain. Martin Mucci : Good morning. David Togut - Evercore Partners : Marty you highlighted that up-tick in competitive takeaways recently. Could you just flush out those comments a little bit. Why do you think your competitive takeaways are increasing? It seems that there has been an increase in innovation generally across the payroll services industry. Martin Mucci : Yes. Well, when I think, you know I think we\u2019ve been a big part of that innovation up-tick. When you think about where we were just a few years ago versus today, online product very strong and we are seeing a big push from clients looking for online products. We have a very good online product, we are continuing to add to that constantly and the report writer and report builder products are very strong for us.  Then you have mobility, so we are really \u2013 I think we have the best mobility product out there from a combined product breadth for the clients, so you can have everything on you. You can get to one to two clients, you can do your own payroll, your employees use it for certainly their pay stubs and W2s and 401(k) information. So I think we\u2019ve been part of that.  I think that\u2019s helped us between that and the great service that we\u2019ve always been know for. I think it has put us in a very good position and I think the sales team has really hit those strides in execution, particularly the last half of last year and continued into the first quarter this year are just doing very well.  We\u2019ve also gone after \u2013 not only we\u2019ve had very good referrals from CPAs over the years, but we\u2019ve gone after making sure we are getting the CPAs that we hadn\u2019t in previous years, with a lot of work that Mark Bottini and the sales team are doing with more direct hitting CPAs that haven\u2019t necessarily referred in past years and getting into those, and the bank channel has picked up for us for us as well as franchise referrals. So we\u2019ve signed up not only the support of like SUBWAY and Tim Hortons and Yum Brands and Midas, but also from our banks; Union Bank and SunTrust of course and a number of others, we all have strong relationship. So I think all that\u2019s helping us kind of beat the competition a little bit more than we have in the past. David Togut - Evercore Partners : Along the same vein, your primary national competitor has talked about completing their entire small business base over to a SaaS base platform by the end of June of next year. Do you think that will have any impact on your head-to-head competitive success versus them? Martin Mucci : I don\u2019t think so. I think for those clients who want a SaaS base offering, we have a very good one and what we I think combined very well is the dedicated personal service with that offering. So you can have a great online offering and I\u2019m sure our competitors do, but I think we have a extremely competitive offering that we\u2019ve invested in for a number of years and knew this was coming, and on top of that just have always provided that great dedicated service, very personalized to the client and I think that helps a lot.  What we like to show a client from a sales perspective is if your getting on with us from payroll, particularly in that under 20 range, look you can do your payroll on your mobile phone, you can do it online, you can do it through a payroll specialist, you can change up, you can call us when you need to, you always have a dedicated person available to you and I think that on top of having the innovation has prepared us very well, even as clients move to a SaaS based offering, we have a very strong one and a number of clients, a great number of our clients are on a SaaS based offering already. Efrain Rivera : And David what I\u2019d add to what Marty said is that when a client is interested in payroll and they are searching particularly over the web, I\u2019ve said this to many of you, we don\u2019t steer them one way or the other. If what they want is a SaaS based solution, they want to get up and running quickly, SurePayroll is there and they do a phenomenal job.  Not every client wants that. Some clients want more service. Service matters. Make no mistake about it. We know that from research, we know at what size clients service matters. If you leave yourself in a situation where you\u2019re only offering your SaaS, you\u2019ve exposed some vulnerability, because clients do value and are willing to pay for service. David Togut - Evercore Partners : Understood. Thank you very much. Martin Mucci : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.: Thank you. Good morning. A clean quarter. Just a few sort of number questions. Just the first one for Efrain. On the HRS revenue growth, the 17%, could you just sort of help us sort of parse the benefit from the acquisition of and also the premium healthcare product. I know you called out what it was as a percentage of total service revenue and if my math was right its, I don\u2019t know, $6.5 million of revenue, but what I was trying to understand is what the contribution to that 17% revenue growth in HRS was along with the acquisition benefit? Efrain Rivera : Yes, acquisition benefit is negligible. It really wasn\u2019t very much, so essentially nothing. On the service revenue you said 6.5, that\u2019s not quite correct. I said 2.5% of total service revenue, so its more in the $16 million range than the $6 million. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.: Yes, I said $16 million, must have just misheard. Efrain Rivera : Yes. So that was the benefit from the accounting change. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.: But you restated the prior year thought too, right. Efrain Rivera : Yes, that\u2019s correct. Yes, we did, yes. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.: So the growth contribution is less than the $16 million, right. Martin Mucci : No, we didn\u2019t have it in the first half though. Efrain Rivera : No Glenn. In the first quarter the numbers include some element of the adjustment, because the first quarter of last year as we stated has a workers comp gross up. So the right apple to apples is an addition of $16 million for the change. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just on the margin expectations throughout the year, you were sort of asked this question before, but obviously typically your first quarter\u2019s the strongest and you again had another strong sort of margin quarter, not as strong as a year ago quarter and you obviously had a very tough comparison versus a year ago. But how should we think about the seasonal pattern of the margins. Is the first quarter typically going to be as it is historically going to be the strongest margin quarter of the year? Efrain Rivera : Its typically been the pattern. I mean it could change in a year given investments, but typically we\u2019re going to have our strongest quarter in the first quarter. At least the trajectory of the direction Glenn is going to be similar to prior years. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay, and then just quickly, I can then infer from your pricing commentary and your attrition commentary, it sounds like competitively your seeing no change. At a minimum you feel at least stable to perhaps somewhat better competitively. Martin Mucci : Yes, I would say somewhat better Glenn. I think definitely between the momentum of the innovation and the products that we are offering and the execution from sales, we are feeling better from a competitive standpoint. So yes, I feel the market, the competitive environment hasn\u2019t really changed all that much and we feel we\u2019re even in the best position we\u2019ve probably been in a long time. Efrain Rivera : Just to add to Marty\u2019s comment, Marty called out the recent review we got for our online product and we don\u2019t highlight SurePayrolls numerous awards. We win a lot of technology awards.  I think seven years ago, five years ago we recognized that there were investments to be made. If you look at the breadth of products that we\u2019ve got, you look at nettime, you look at myStaffingPro, you look at ExpenseWire, these are all leading products in their respective categories. So we understand this is a technology gain. We are very, very clear on that. We also understand which some people in the market seem to be forgetting, its also a service gain and especially in the under 50 space where we have 94% of our clients. Ability to provide service is a differentiator and while some people don\u2019t seem to be thinking it is, we\u2019ve done the research and we know it is. So we feel pretty good about where we\u2019re at. Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co.: Great. Thanks a lot guys. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, thanks. Good morning. With the checks per payroll growth around 1%, how much of that 1% do you think is mix, maybe bringing that down versus actual hiring trends? Martin Mucci : So if I give you 1% Sara, that\u2019s an apple-to-apples. So we modified the methodology a little bit using our normal methodology and also doing same store. Same store for us is about 1%. If you don\u2019t do it the other way we\u2019re doing it, there\u2019s probably a two-tenths difference; its not significant. So the 1% probably is \u2013 well, not probably, but is a hiring within the base. Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So really, your seeing really slower hiring than you had been before. Efrain Rivera : I would say if you just look at our small business index, so where we\u2019ve seen, where definitely this year has been strong at the rate of growth in hiring in small business over last year and even thought its been a little, its tempered down a little bit the last three out of four months, its still stronger than last year and its definitely stronger than our base year for the index, which is 2004. Its like a whole percent stronger hiring growth rate in small businesses under 50 employees. So we still think that hiring is up over last year, even though it tempered a little in the summer. Its still stronger than last year and we\u2019re certainly benefiting from that. Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, and then separately, last quarter you talked about new sales growth being the highest that you\u2019ve seen; I think it was in seven years. Did you see continued momentum along those lines in the first quarter? Efrain Rivera : Yes, definitely. Definitely felt that the execution continued. We are seeing not only good unit growth in the number of sales, but also holding price and gaining in kind of the revenue per client. So we are seeing very good sales execution and feel very good that that momentum has continued and we certainly are looking forward to continue through a big selling season here coming up. Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, and then just last question I wanted to clarify something from earlier. The sales force hiring for the fiscal year, you said you\u2019ve done about 3% so far. I had thought that you were thinking about planning on doing 5%. Is the target now 3%? Efrain Rivera : No, I think that probably what happened there was we were comparing against where we were at a point prior to the year. Right now we\u2019re about 4%, close to 4.5% higher than we were last year. So at the end of May we\u2019re about 4.5% higher than we are. Martin Mucci : But we were down a little bit. Last year headcount, there was a little bit more turnover. Turnover has come down a lot and it wasn\u2019t super high last year, but it was higher than it is now and so turnover is come down and we were a little bit low, below where we wanted to be last year at some points of the year and where we are now is besides the new hiring everything is fully staffed, in fact overstaffed in a few areas. Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thank you very much. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Jeff Silber - BMO Capital Markets : Thanks so much. Sorry, just a quick follow-up on the sales force question. Assuming normal turnover will sales force have probably stayed relatively stable for the rest of the year, is that correct? Martin Mucci : Well, I think what we\u2019re saying is it would be up. It will stay fairly stable for now, from where we are now, yes. Jeff Silber - BMO Capital Markets : That\u2019s my question. Martin Mucci : Yes. Jeff Silber - BMO Capital Markets : Okay, great. And then just on the seasonality side, Efrain I know you called out a few things last quarter regarding growth rates in the HRS revenue and your operating margins for each quarter. Any changes to that or anything else we need to be aware of on a seasonal basis. Thanks. Efrain Rivera : Not particularly. We\u2019ll call out in next quarter\u2019s call if we see anything\u2019s that are different from guidance, but no. I think the other thing Jeff I\u2019d say is that if you look at the presentation that we posted, should have posted it just recently, we have the supplemental guidance schedule at the end there. We are still within those ranges, so if you look at that closely, that\u2019s a pretty good guide for where we expect to be. Jeff Silber - BMO Capital Markets : All right, great. I\u2019ll take a look at that. Thanks so much. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Brian Keen with Deutsche Bank. Brian Keen - Deutsche Bank : Yes, hi guys; just a couple of clarifications. What percentage of the new sales is going towards the SaaS based solution versus more of a full service model in core payroll? Efrain Rivera : Yes, we don\u2019t break that out Brian specifically and its becoming increasingly difficult to do so and the reason for that is that not only do we have SurePayroll, but we also have our own online product, which Marty talked about earlier. If you combine both of those, you\u2019re probably up over a quarter, maybe even 30% or so of sales in those models. That\u2019s about as definitive as we can get. Brian Keen - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And the record sales you guys have seen, does that get us to potentially outside kind of the guided range? Are we trending above the range of kind of where we guided to for core and HR? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense. How does it translate into revenue if the sales numbers seem to be due and come track it ahead of plan. Efrain Rivera : Yes, no. I don\u2019t think we are ready to start changing the guidance ranges. I would say we feel pretty comfortable that we\u2019re well within those guidance ranges. Build revenue builds over the course of the year and while we feel real good about Q1, we still have three quarters to go. We\u2019ll get a better picture as we get through the selling season, get some early signs. Brian Keen - Deutsche Bank : Okay, and just last question for me. It looked like finally we turned the corner on interest and clients\u2019 funds, but just your expectations, we always get the question on rates and rate increases. Just maybe give us an update on that. Thanks so much. Efrain Rivera : So you know our assumption is not much is going to change in this fiscal, so this fiscal growth is to May. We think the real action then starts to occur in 2016. The fed is really giving a lot of very inconsistent signals. It looks like they want to race sooner rather than later, but our planning assumption is really, its going to be a 2016 event, not a 2015 event. If they do it, obviously we\u2019ll be happy with it, but its probably a next year event. Brian Keen - Deutsche Bank :   And then just remind us, a raise of 25 basis points or just the impact of the model, just so we can get ready for it. Efrain Rivera : It\u2019s about between $4 million and $5 million; that\u2019s the cliff notes version. It\u2019s a little bit more complicated than that, but that\u2019s our disclosure in the Q, so yes. It starts to add up in a hurry if we get what we hope, which is a rise in short term interest rates and the long part of the yield curve also goes up. Brian Keen - Deutsche Bank : Okay, super. Thanks so much. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jim MacDonald with First Analysis. Jim MacDonald - First Analysis : Yes, good morning guys. Efrain Rivera : Good morning. Jim MacDonald - First Analysis : I just wanted to clarify a comment. Marty, I think you said something about moving down market with your sales force. Maybe you could explain that. Martin Mucci : Yes, one of the things is that we found that in selling, our approach in the past has been a lot in what we call core payroll sales side. Its been very much the sell-in payroll and then the other sales teams would kind of reach in over time at different stages to say, hey, are you ready now for a 401(k) or workers comp or health insurance and so forth and while we made some changes this year in saying that if you\u2019re a certain size, that we are coming in now with a combined sales force.  So I guess what I\u2019m saying is, we\u2019ve kind of moved down in offering the full breadth of our services right up front in the way we approach a client and I think we\u2019ve gotten some nice traction and good stories on it already. By approaching a client with multiple sales teams together at once if they are lets say 20 employees, you might go in with HR Outsourcing, 401(k) and payroll all at the same time. In the past our model was much more, hey I\u2019ll sell you payroll and then the other teams will come in after you\u2019ve had a month or two on the service and see if you need something else.  So we\u2019re finding that that kind of the need for those services, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen this, has kind of pushed down over time and with the technology and the number of products available and we think that this is a better way to capitalize on some of that. Its making sure the full need of the client is addressed right up front as opposed to our traditional model, which was selling them payroll right up front. Efrain Rivera : And I would say one other thing Jim is that our sales force execution capability is really, really superb and that\u2019s helped us to understand the potential of this integrated selling approach and its paying dividends, yes. Jim MacDonald - First Analysis : And maybe just another update on how you\u2019re doing in the middle markets. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve talked about that much yet. Martin Mucci : Yes, I think there we\u2019ve offered an awful lot of products, so we\u2019re combining all that product. I think you\u2019ll see shortly we are going to kind of brand that whole thing together, because we\u2019ve been adding a lot of product as Efrain said and mentioned.  MyStaffingPro, ExpenseWire, our own Paychex, next generation offerings, our time and attendance now with both our legacy product and nettime and we are in the process of being sure. Now we\u2019ve already been selling it that way, but we are kind of bundling it all together and we\u2019ll be announcing that shortly to kind of put a tag all the way around that, along with we\u2019ve been changing some of the service model there to be sure that when you have multi products from us, that its handled as smoothly as possible from a multi product standpoint. So mid market is, we\u2019d always like it to be stronger, but its doing well against the competition that\u2019s out there and because I think we have a full breadth of product as well as a great sales team there. Jim MacDonald - First Analysis : Thanks very much. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Tim McHugh with William Blair. Tim McHugh - William Blair : Yes, thanks. Just following up on that last one I guess, are you seeing faster growth in the middle market or amongst your smaller customer base at this point, just relative to each other? Martin Mucci : Relative I\u2019d say, kind of the small under 50 is stronger. I think that\u2019s the marketplace. I think that\u2019s the economy. What we are seeing is small business starting to pick up finally. Still not where it was, but that\u2019s starting to pick up and that we\u2019re offering that approach of \u2013 we\u2019ve already been offering the larger clients the 50 plus, the multitude of products upfront. This approach of selling the breadth of our services below 50 on the front end is a newer approach and so I think that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re picking up there a little bit faster because of that approach.  Also, the referral channels that I talk about, the banking, the franchise and of course are continuing in the CPA referral model, its always been strong for us, that\u2019s where you see the smaller business growth come from, because these are start-ups or companies that have reached the size, that under 50, but that they need a payroll solution. So I definitely say that the under 50 is seeing a little bit stronger growth rate now. I think that\u2019s more because of those things than anything. Tim McHugh - William Blair : And the change in the PEO business in terms of the self assured plans, I get that counting impact that you\u2019ve described to us, but I guess is it driving a significant improvement or acceleration in the growth rate of that business as well. I mean is it also helping in the unit adds in a big way, because its more attractive to people. Martin Mucci : Yes, I mean its still fairly new to us, but I definitely \u2013 we did it as much, because from a competitive standpoint we felt that it was worth taking on a little bit more of the risk and so forth, because we had even more competitive product.  We still have a number of carriers, but this plan particularly in Florida where it\u2019s a very competitive PEO market I think put us in a great spot. We\u2019ll find out a lot more in the next quarter or so as you get into the true selling season of benefits and so forth, but we feel very good that that\u2019s positioned us even more competitively now in the PEO. Efrain Rivera : And we also \u2013 just to add to what Marty said, I mean we really have a terrific PEO team and group that manages that business. So I think our execution capability, our product capability have never been better. Tim McHugh - William Blair : Can you or would you, in terms of the comprehensive I know you report comprehensive HR Outsourcing, kind of work side employees. Can you give us a rough sense of how much of that is PEO at this point and how big is that business now for you guys? Efrain Rivera : Yes, its still relatively, I should say on the gross of it \u2013 I was going to say it was relatively small. Its still not the bulk of HRS, but its growing in importance. Tim, the reason why I give you a somewhat imprecise answer there is that unlike other competitors, we manage our ASO and PEO and this other smaller product we call HR essentially, which is a lighter version of our outsourcing product together in one sales force and we are somewhat still agnostic in terms of whether a sales person sells a PEO or ASO. Its going to depend on what client needs are. , : Martin Mucci : Yes, I think the point there is Efrain saying, when you look at all the products combined, that outsourcing of the HR function is a significant part of the HRS business and I think as we said in fourth quarter, we don\u2019t give the numbers, all that probably one a year, but we service more client employees than any competitor combined and I think for the most part probably any two competitors combined. When you combined PEO, ASO and what Efrain\u2019s HRE, kind of an essential offering, we are the largest HR outsourcer in that product set. So we are very proud of that and that growth is going very well. Tim McHugh - William Blair : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is fro David Grossman with Stifel. David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus : Hi, thank you. I\u2019m wondering if we can just go back to another question, because maybe I just misunderstood. But when we look at the growth year-over-year of 17% in that HRS line, to get an apples-to-apples number, should we backing out $16 million of this year revenue, because that\u2019s \u2026 Martin Mucci : That\u2019s correct. David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus : So it looks like then the growth rate was about 10% year-over-year. Does that sound right to you? Efrain Rivera : Not too far off. David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus : Right. And is that, I don\u2019t know if I got good comps for the year, for the fiscal \u201813 year. So is that deceleration from what we say last year or last years numbers. Efrain Rivera : Its comparable to Q4 of last year. David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus : Okay. And then, but the guidance for the year is \u2013 how do we normalize that guidance for the\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Yes, so I think we went through that David. So we have a 16% to 19% guidance range and we said about 5% of it is the PEO. 16% to 19% HRS to be precise and minus 5%, so you pick the number you feel makes more sense. So I think the gist to your question, not reading in too much is that we expect HRS to accelerate as the year goes on. David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus : Right, and what is the basis for that, based on \u2013 because you guys certainly improve your visibility in your business, so\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Yes, I think there is probably three things on that; one is we expect insurance services to accelerate as we go through the year, that\u2019s a function of a number of things, not the least of which is being fully staffed and anniversarying some comparison in that business that we talked last year, that\u2019s one. And then I think as Marty said, we talked a lot of this call, just the growth and the momentum in HR outsourcing services we think continues to build through the quarters and through the year. David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus : Right and just on that last point, is there anything we should be thinking about in the context of what\u2019s going on, either with the affordable care act or the regulatory environment at larger that would make us more optimistic or less optimistic over the next 12 to 18 months. Efrain Rivera : Yes, I\u2019ll let Marty talk to kind of compliance related products, which is its own sort of set of discussions. But I do want to clarify that our guidance doesn\u2019t assume that there is some material change in what we are seeing in terms of up-tick of some of the compliance related products, which Marty can talk to a second. We just are looking at based on the rate and on our plan where we expect to be as the year progresses. Martin Mucci : Yes, I think in general, David its not getting any less regulated. Everything is getting more complex and so one, regulations aren\u2019t going to get any easier and the healthcare reform just continues to drive a lot of confusion at all levels as to when its kicking in, what does it mean for them and I think its probably still pretty fluid from the way things have been. Second, the technology has gotten a lot better, the innovation has gotten a lot better, and for example our products and in others products, other competitors products that drive the ability to use HR services online at a lower level of client size, employee size and so a lot of that is come down because the technology and the products have gotten better and I think that that bodes well for us.  We talk about time and attendance, and we talk about HR administration online, products that we have. These used to be 50 plus solidly, 50 to 100 plus. They\u2019ve come down and many clients are using them now, and the mobility offerings make it a lot easier as well. We find that the mobility offerings are being used by clients for everything from their employee contact list to reviewing an employees 401(k) with them right face to face, just looking at their mobile app. So all that bodes well I think for demand for HR online, payroll online and a lot of the other.  We didn\u2019t even really touch on 401(k), but 401(k) continues to be very strong as well. I think the market leaves it always a little shaky and 401(k) whether to jump in or not, but we are certainly seeing assets increase and our initiative on large market, larger plans has started to pick up and pay some dividends as well. Efrain Rivera : Yes, and just to build on Marty, I just focused almost exclusively on HR outsourcing, but we also expect that our retirement services revenue is going to build through the year too. David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus : Right. And just one last thing; again, based on the comment you made earlier, if the quarter came in perhaps a little bit stronger than you had anticipated and again, that you typically have pretty good visibility on your business going into a year, let alone a quarter, can you help us better understand what the components were that maybe kind of drove a slightly better result than you had anticipated. Efrain Rivera : Yes, David I think I\u2019d just leave it that to say we thought we had a strong quarter, we were pleased with it. If we were happy with what we saw on the payroll service side and HRS continue to performer strongly, I\u2019m cautious about getting too granular about projecting Q1 trends for the remainder of the year, because as I said easier, we try to give annual guidance and stick with that, so we don\u2019t get into a quarter-over-quarter conversation.  And the only think on caveat is the selling season is important to us and its good to start well, its much, much better to finish well and so we will continue to work on doing that, so we can continue to deliver good results. David Grossman - Stifel Nicolaus : All right, fair enough. Thank you. Martin Mucci : All right, thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Tim Wiley with Wells Fargo. Tim Wiley - Wells Fargo : Thanks and good morning. I wanted to \u2013 you just touched on it, but my question was about the 401(k) and retirement services business on two fronts. First was, I remember \u2013 I guess this is probably within the last couple of years. There was some shift towards different kind of plans that I think was sort of herding the revenue growth relative to asset or account growth in that business. I\u2019m sort of curious if we\u2019ve sort of cycled through that and there is not any kind of revenue issue relative to account growth or asset values that would have been a headwind like you transitioned through. Martin Mucci : Yes, I think you have might been \u2013 I\u2019m sorry go ahead. Tim Wiley - Wells Fargo : No, and then the second part of the question if I could was just again you talked about the confidence you have in that business. Just anything specific to sales or product or if there are different referral channels that maybe more productive around 401(k) and retirement services that you are focused or sort of figured out some opportunities around the sales management referral channels to help that business. Efrain Rivera : I\u2019ll let Marty take the second part. So the first part Tim, I think you might be referring to the fact that about two years ago or so we decided to take a portion of the retirement services sales force and dedicate them to the up market. When we did that, we took people who were servicing the smaller market out and didn\u2019t necessarily replace those. So we had a little bit of a transition in that business as we did that as the larger market reps were starting to ramp up.  So we\u2019ve anniversaried that. We think that the larger market reps are doing a really good job and in execution its helped our growth rates and retirement services and fell that we\u2019ve got a nice runway in front of us. You can see that in part by the amount of the growth and assets that hasn\u2019t been just market growth, but its also been planed growth, meaning more plans and larger plans. So I think we are past that anniversary. I\u2019ll let Marty talk about the second part question. Martin Mucci : I think Efrain pretty much covered it. I think the other thing we were doing was, we were having a team that builds a lot more \u2013 focuses on relationships with the financial advisors and I think that that\u2019s really starting to pay some dividends there.  It takes time to kind of build that relationships, so that they trust us going into not only a brand new client, but to go with a larger client and a conversion of a larger asset base and we are really starting to pickup I think some momentum there and some trust from financial advisors to not just give us the start-ups, but the larger clients as well and I think to us that gives us confidence that we are going to see the year either as we predicted or a little bit stronger. Tim Wiley - Wells Fargo : Great. Thanks very much. Martin Mucci : Okay. Efrain Rivera : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird. Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird: Good morning and congratulations Martin and Efrain. Martin Mucci : Thanks Mark. Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird: With regards, just staying on the 401(k) for a second, so what sort of level of growth should we anticipate roughly speaking on return of services? Efrain Rivera : Mark, obviously we don\u2019t break that out. It doesn\u2019t grow quite as quickly as HRS overall, but it\u2019s a little bit less than that. Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird: Just a little bit less that what, the organic underlying growth. Efrain Rivera : Correct yes, the organic underlying growth. Thanks for the clarification. Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird: Yes, and then with regards to the healthcare offering on the PEO side, how should we think about the profitability of that. Efrain Rivera : The profitability of\u2026 Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird: Of the minimum premium plan healthcare option. Efrain Rivera : : Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird: So, it sounds like the reality of what we should think about from an economic perspective would basically be that 11% to 14% growth on an underlying basis is really where we should focus. Efrain Rivera : That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right, yes. Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird: Okay, great. And then with regards to the core, really glad to hear about how things are shaping up. Can you talk a little bit about some of the sales force metrics with regards to both the turnover rate, as well as the percentage of sales people that are currently running at your historical quarter rates? Efrain Rivera : Yes, well one, for turnover it\u2019s a little bit below where we\u2019ve been historically. Kind of historical average is in that 30% to 35% turnover rate. We are at the low end to that range right now and that can always change, but for first quarter its been very good.  The recruiting I think of the new reps has been very good. So I think we are picking up a very good quality of new reps and the training consistently has been revamped and so forth. I think its very good execution in the leadership team across the board from the senior team right to the district sales managers. It just feels like a good experience level now in that team and that they done very well. So when you look at the metrics and I think I have said this, the units what they are selling, the number of units is good, as well as holding price. So that to us bodes well from an experience level and in execution of the rep. So they are not just going in selling price and we are getting more units at a low price. We are getting unit growth and revenue per unit growth.  So again first quarter, but we are feeling positive about the execution of that sales team from those kind of metrics. Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird: Great and is there a sizable percentage that are now approaching our old historical pre-recession quarter rates. Efrain Rivera : I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d go that far. I would say from a annualized revenue perspective, there is certainly showing some promise, but I don\u2019t think again the economy isn\u2019t where it was pre-recession. But I\u2019d say, relative to the last few years and last year where we started to see really the best in seven years, we are still at that level. So it\u2019s defiantly the best we\u2019ve seen since the recession and it continues to go up. I wouldn\u2019t say its right at that pre-recession levels yet though. Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird: Right and then one last one. Marty, with regards to the commentary in terms of the competitive takeaways, I missed that in terms of who that\u2019s coming from. Can you\u2026 Martin Mucci : No, because I don\u2019t think I said. So it didn\u2019t miss the exact things here, but it certainly is the national player and as well as the regionals, more regional players. I think what you are seeing is, national player I think what we are doing very well is selling the value of our service combined with the technology and that means that they can be online or they can be a SaaS offering that\u2019s online with mobile or full service. I think from the regional players what you are seeing is particularly smaller players in the market. They are struggling more with the technology. They don\u2019t have the mobility offerings, they don\u2019t have the online offerings. These are changing constantly. We are updating our mobile offerings probably every quarter with something new. And the smaller players just can\u2019t, you just can\u2019t keep up with that technology now and we are finding the clients are really using it. : Mark Marcon - Robert W. Baird: That\u2019s great color. Thank you very much. Martin Mucci : You\u2019re welcome Mark. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Lisa Ellis with Sanford Bernstein. Lisa Ellis - Sanford Bernstein : Hi guys, good morning and I\u2019m happy to be joining these calls. I had a question on the PEO business. Clearly, a healthy growth there. Can you characterize what if any risk you take on as you grow this business and sort of what the mitigation approaches are around that? Efrain Rivera : Yes, so Lisa there\u2019s two risks that everyone takes on, who is in the PEO business. It\u2019s the quality of the workers comp, underwriting and then secondarily, although we have talked a lot about minimum premium plans, we still have a lot of health insurance plans that are not under this cost sharing arrangements.  In the cost sharing arrangements and I should say the risk sharing arrangements, if your healthcare book is not what you would expected it to be, you can end up with having more healthcare costs than you gauged and the same thing with workers comp.  We use a number of sets of actuaries. I\u2019m pretty familiar with the underwriting process in both areas and we set the probabilities that we will exceed our targets at a very, very low rate. Meaning, when we ask our actuaries to do projections of what we think the costs are, we are not asking them to do a 95% probability and typically we\u2019re asking them to set it at 99%-plus.  So on the workers comp side, we have done that over a number of years and have very, very good results managing books, our books of business on the workers comp side and we feel pretty comfortable we have very deep expertise on the healthcare side, understanding and assisting risks and in the last year really build up our underwriting capability and our management capability is the PEO.  So we fell pretty comfortable. Wouldn\u2019t go down this route if we didn\u2019t. Lisa Ellis - Sanford Bernstein : Yes, and has that been sort of the rate limiting factor on growth in the business, given we are seeing health growth in the PEO business is kind of across the industry and the economics, they are kind of coming in new to the space.  Right, the economics to you and the economics to the client appear to be pretty compelling. So I\u2019m just trying to understand like really nice healthy growth, but why isn\u2019t that faster. Does it end up being the underwriting component of it that kind of rate limits that? Efrain Rivera : No. I think its one element of it, but Marty faces the decision around how to make tradeoffs with investments across a number of different sales forces that are growing and so I would say two or three years ago people who followed us closely knew we struggled a little bit in the PEO, took a breather, retooled and have really gotten ourselves back in the game. So I think our level of investment in that sales force is commensurate with what we think the opportunity is right now. And one other thing I would add to that is that its not just PEO for us. That\u2019s an important element of what we sell in HRO, but we have a very, very strong ASO business, which is very similar to PEO, but doesn\u2019t have some of the risk characteristics that the PEO does. So we\u2019re looking at it a bit more holistically than other competitors do. Lisa Ellis - Sanford Bernstein : Terrific, and real quick on the core payroll business. You mentioned that you\u2019re seeing continued growth in the number of clients in core payroll. I know you don\u2019t disclose that on a quarterly basis, but can you kind of bound that? I know in this past fiscal year it went up above 1% for the first time in several years. Are we sort of still running in that trajectory, stronger, weaker? Efrain Rivera : So last year we finished at about 2%. We\u2019re certainly in that range. Lisa Ellis - Sanford Bernstein : Good. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien-tsin Huang \u2013 JPMorgan: Thanks. Good morning. Good results. So just quickly on the competitive take away question. I caught the national and regional, but what about against point solution providers. You made it pretty clear that service is still in high demand. How about the competitive take away versus point solution providers? Efrain Rivera : Okay, so define your definition Tien-tsin on\u2026 Tien-tsin Huang \u2013 JPMorgan: Yes, I\u2019m thinking about point, you know I\u2019m thinking about call it a payroll always player or benefits only provider, only 401(k) administrator. Just trying to think about, unbundling all the different HRS solutions out there and seeing if maybe those are drifting in your direction. Does that make sense Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Yes, it makes sense. Martin Mucci : And I think that that is \u2013 we tend to do very well again. I think that the demand for the HR, kind of the overlapping services is pushed down in the market and so with the technology and the offerings and so forth, and so I think the point service, kind of the point providers as you\u2019d say, I think its tougher for them to sell by themselves and the better you can integrate that experience and make it easier for the client, they do \u2013 more and more clients need multiple services and they are not as interested in, hey I\u2019m going to take things from three different providers. So the key is, okay now and you can see what we\u2019ve acquired over the years. We\u2019ve brought in these great point solutions and the key is to integrate them as seamlessly as possible from a service perspective for the clients, so that you\u2019re adding a lot more value. They don\u2019t have the time or the desire anymore to integrate themselves, the clients, to integrate three different products and I don\u2019t think, and so it\u2019s all a matter of integrating it in together and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve continued to do and we\u2019ll continue to work on. Efrain Rivera : And Tien-tsin, in the under 50 space particularly, it maybe different in the enterprise space. What clients value about \u2013 one of the many things that clients value in that space is the ability to have one single point of access to your data. So a single sign on is really, really big and then when that single sign on is coupled with your ability to access all of the different aspects of the data that your trying to manage, be it health and benefits, 401(k), HR Outsourcing, that\u2019s really the compelling proposition. It maybe different in the enterprise space, but certainly in the under 50 space they are looking for that integration as Marty said. Tien-tsin Huang \u2013 JPMorgan: Yes, now that makes sense. Its just my only follow-on is just, I know there\u2019s a lot of questions on the 3%, the sales force increase, but given the single point of access, the sales person is now required to be smart on a lot of different subjects. So does that change your comp structure or even your go to market and how you touch the client? Martin Mucci : No, not really. I mean I think we\u2019ve had it. We\u2019re very competitive first of all from the comp structure and we always made changes to be sure we stay very competitive on that, but also we are doing a lot of team selling. So the point I was trying to make earlier is that where we\u2019ve come down now, where that was always the approach, pretty much the approach anyway on the 50 plus, below 50 now and probably even in that 20 and above range, there\u2019s a lot more team selling going on.  So we have expertise, not necessarily expecting the rep to know everything. Its saying, hey when you used to go in and sell payroll and then your 401(k) sales team would come in a month later or two months later or six months later. Now we go in together as a team on a lot of these leads and say what\u2019s the full breadth of what the client needs and look to sell them upfront.  So its not necessarily requiring a lot more from each individual sales person, but more of a team approach to the way we\u2019re selling, which seems to be getting some traction now. I think the markets ready for it and I think we\u2019re going to \u2013 we will execute it well. Tien-tsin Huang \u2013 JPMorgan: Got it. Thanks Marty, thanks Efrain. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Martin Mucci : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our final question today is from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Martin Mucci : Hi Ashwin. Operator : Please check your mute. Martin Mucci : Okay, I think Ashwin may have left the building. Operator : I\u2019m not receiving any response and I\u2019m showing no further question. Martin Mucci : Okay, at this point we will close the call. If you\u2019re interested in replaying the webcast to this conference call, it will be archived till October 24. Our annual meeting of stockholders will be held October 15 at 10 :00 a.m. in Rochester, New York and that meeting will also be broadcast over the Internet as well. I thank you for you taking the time to participate in our call and your interest in Paychex. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this moment. Now, I will turn the meeting to President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Martin Mucci. Sir, you may begin. Martin Mucci : Great, thank you and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex second quarter fiscal 2015 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2014. We will file our Form 10-Q which provides additional discussion and analysis of our results for the quarter within the next few days. Our earnings release and Form 10-Q will be available on our Investor Relations page at paychex.com. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 1 month. On today\u2019s call, I will review highlights from the second quarter and our operations, sales and product development areas, Efrain will review our second quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance, and then we will open it up for your questions. We were pleased with the second quarter results. We continue to see growth and have good progress on our key initiatives. Payroll revenue continues to advance as a result of increases in revenue per check and client base growth. HRS revenue grew at double-digit rates in the second quarter led by our success in selling HR outsourcing solutions to our clients. Total service revenue increased 10%. From the sales perspective, we saw continued progress during the second quarter, particularly in our Paychex HR services and retirement services. We are fully staffed, rep retention and development is on track, and we have continued to be successful in adding new bank and franchise referral arrangements as well as increasing our web leads in addition to our CPA referral channel. Our partnership between our selling organizations has never been more efficient as they help our clients realize the full value of the breadth of services that Paychex has to offer, including our newest offering stratustime, the leading cloud-based time and attendance solution in the market from the addition of our nettime solutions company acquired last June. We are also seeing an increase in the sales of our healthcare reform related product. We are in a unique position with both payroll data and insurance agency to offer our clients assistance in value and understanding the impact and requirements of the Affordable Care Act and its impact on their business and their employees. We can bring clients great value by helping them navigate the complexities of the act and stay in compliance with their requirements. From a technology perspective, we continue to focus on bringing industry leading products and enhancements to the market to meet the growing needs of our clients. Our innovative leading edge technology coupled with our exceptional client service we believe sets us apart in the market. During the second quarter, we introduced Paychex Flex, a product offering which integrates our leading edge software-as-a-service platform with our newly expanded service offerings. Paychex Flex offers powerful capabilities and a simple user experience that responds to the needs of our clients across the human capital management spectrum. Our new service initiatives offers clients the flexibility of choice for their service needs. This approach gives clients access to a variety of customer service options based on their size and complexity, including our new 24/7 customer service center. Paychex Flex offers a unique blend of both software and service and we believe again it differentiates us Paychex in the marketplace. In Q2, we also enhanced our mobile app with the introduction of Paychex Time, a mobile time punch app that offers the quickest mobile punch possible. This app enables client employees to securely record their hours and avoid time consuming log-ins. In summary, we are pleased with our continued execution of our sales and service teams, our product strength and the financial performance. And I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employee team across the country and in Germany and Brazil. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Marty and good morning. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call \u2013 during today\u2019s conference call, we will make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risks, refer to the press release for a discussion of forward-looking statements and related risk factors. You also may recall that during the latter part of last year, we have introduced new health insurance offering within our PEO. For PEO clients and worksite employees, due to the self insurance provisions within the new offering, we began classifying certain PEO direct costs as operating expenses rather than a reduction in service revenue. This change had no impact on operating income. This new product offering had an impact on our fiscal 2015 second quarter and 6-month results as it was not initiated until the second half of fiscal 2014. As Marty indicated, our second quarter financial results for fiscal 2015 represented continued progress from the solid start we had for the year. Here are some of the key highlights. I will provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of our 2015 outlook. Total service revenue grew 10% for the second quarter to $666 million and 9% to $1.3 billion for the six months. Interest on funds held for clients increased 4% for the second quarter and 3% for the six months to $10 million and $21 million respectively. These fluctuations were driven by an increase in average investment balances. Expenses increased 10% for the second quarter and 11% for the six months primarily in compensation related costs and PEO direct costs. The increase in the portion of PEO direct costs is the result of the new health insurance offering, which accounted for approximately 4% of total expenses for both the quarter and the year-to-date periods. The increase in compensation related costs was driven by higher employee benefit related costs mostly medical costs along with higher sales headcount and performance based comp costs. We also continue our investment in our product development and supporting technology. Operating income net of certain items increased 9% for the second quarter and 7% for the six months $260 million and $517 million respectively. We maintained strong operating margins and anticipate that our full year will remain within our guidance range, which I will discuss shortly. Diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $0.47 per share for the second quarter and 7% to $0.94 per share for the six months. Net income increased 9% to $173 million for the second quarter and 7% to $344 million for the six month. Payroll revenue, payroll service revenue increased 4% for both the second quarter and six months. We benefited from increases in revenue per check and client base. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting along with the impact of increased product penetration. We saw a moderation in the growth in checks per payroll. In Q2 expect that that will continue through the year. HRS revenue grew 21% for the second quarter and 19% for the six months. The increase reflects an increase in PEO revenue as a result of the new minimum premium plan that I referred to earlier. This represented approximately 7% of total HRS service revenue for the quarter and six month periods. In addition we experienced strong growth in both clients and worksite employees of Paychex\u2019s HR, all of the metrics \u2013 operational metrics on the HRS side are trending very positively. Retirement services revenue benefited from pricing together with increase in the number of plans and average asset value of participant funds. Our online HR administration products contributed to the growth through sales success of SaaS solutions. Turning to our investment portfolio, our goal is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We invested in high-quality lower risk instruments primarily variable rate demand notes and bank demand deposits for short-term funds of mutual bonds for the longer term. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.6% and an average duration of 3.2 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.1% for the second quarter and six months consistent with the same periods last year. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased during the second quarter and six months primarily driven by wage inflation together with growth in the client base. I will now walk you through highlights for our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $928 million as of the end of November and no debt. Funds held for clients as of October \u2013 November 30 were $4.0 billion compared to $4.2 billion as of May 31, 2014. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.6 billion both the quarter and six months. This reflects growth of 4% for both periods. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $1.8 million reflecting $276 million in dividends paid during the six months and 1.3 million shares repurchased. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 35%. Cash flows from operations were $405 million for the first six months, a slight increase from the prior year. This change was the result of higher net income on cash flow from operations offset by fluctuations in working capital. The fluctuations in our operating assets and liabilities between periods were primarily related to timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation, PEO payroll income tax and other liabilities. All of these were affected by cut offs in a given month. It is common for working capital to fluctuate between quarters. Now let me turn to guidance for the remainder of the year. I would like to remind you that our outlook is based on current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes and that is our expectations and our guidance is unchanged for the year. Total service revenue is anticipated to be in the range of 8% to 10% but the ranges for payroll and HRS consistent with previous guidance. Let me provide additional color on the second half of the year. We expect that payroll services will be at the very low end of the full year guidance range in the third quarter, but in the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be above the midpoint of the range and this really just has to do with some timing of revenue shift from third into fourth quarter. It doesn\u2019t affect the year as a whole. So, let me just repeat that again. We expect payroll services revenue to be at the very low end of the range in the third quarter, but above the midpoint of the range in the fourth quarter for the reasons that I just mentioned. We have also updated the supplemental guidance schedule to reflect HRS revenue expectations in the third and fourth quarters and you will see that those ranges have been tightened somewhat. These changes which are modest changes to update the ranges a little more precisely, so you can update your models to have no impact whatsoever on full year guidance. Net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 6% to 8%. Our operating margin tax rate for the year expected to be consistent with prior guidance. Now, I will turn it back to Marty. Martin Mucci : Great. Now, Derrick will open it up for any questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Alright, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Mr. David Togut of Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open. David Togut- Evercore ISI : Thank you. Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Efrain Rivera : Hi, David. Martin Mucci : Good morning, David. David Togut- Evercore ISI : Do you have any early read on the calendar year end selling season in client retention? Martin Mucci : Yes, client retention continues to be very strong. So, we feel very good, very consistent with that and the early look obviously you don\u2019t know until it \u2013 obviously, we are through January, but it looks good to us and selling continues to progress well. It is early particularly in the small market side to know for sure, but we are, I think we are off to a good start through November and December from what we are seeing. We have got full rep headcount. We have got turnover pretty consistent to where we wanted to be and we are feeling at this point pretty good about it. David Togut- Evercore ISI : What is client retention running currently? Martin Mucci : I say we are very consistent still around 82%, which is basically our all-time best. David Togut- Evercore ISI : Got it. And can you quantify for us bookings growth in the November quarter? Martin Mucci : No, we don\u2019t really \u2013 we don\u2019t give that out. We certainly would wait until we get through the selling season before we talk about kind of how it was. We feel pretty good about it though. We mentioned in the first quarter that we felt good about Q1. Q2 was very consistent from a revenue part growth, annualized revenue sold. David Togut- Evercore ISI : Can you quantify growth in checks per client? Efrain Rivera : Yes, checks per client were under 1% in the quarter. I mentioned in previous calls that once we started dipping under 1%, we wouldn\u2019t call out the exact tenths of a point. We saw some moderation in checks per client. We are looking at it. It seems to be consistent with what we are seeing in the \u2013 and what seems to be happening in the under 50 space, which is around 1%, a little bit under in terms of employment growth, but we will have to say it can vary sometimes from quarter-to-quarter. This wasn't a particularly strong quarter from a checks per payroll standpoint. David Togut- Evercore ISI : Understood. And then on pricing, can you quantify what the net price increases running after discounting? Efrain Rivera : Yes, David, I wouldn\u2019t go any further than to say we are still in that 2% to 4% range. I feel pretty comfortable it\u2019s holding. I don\u2019t see any significant issues there. David Togut- Evercore ISI : Understood. Just a quick final question, ADP completes their transition of their small business client base to run they say by the end of fiscal \u201815 ending June. What impact will that have in your view in terms of direct head-to-head competition versus ADP? And if you could maybe frame that in terms of any new products you have in the small business space? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So, David as far as we can understand their strategy, they appear to be obviously moving a lot of people on to their run platform and also moving a lot of people to an online service model that has some strengths and some weaknesses associated with it. We think there are challenges in the lower end to operate with that model and we think we have differentiated service that will compete very well from a platform perspective, from technology what they offer versus what we offer in the small market. We feel pretty comfortable we can compete pretty effectively and we think we have got the better service model. Martin Mucci : Yes. I think just to add to that they have been going through this platform change for a while and I think we have competed very well. In fact if you kind of look at the gains and net gain from our numbers, we are gaining slightly from that. And we always lose some and take some. And I think we are still doing very well, so we don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t really anticipate much change there. As well as Efrain said I think we compete very effectively from the product standpoint, our SaaS-based products our online interface and mobility apps I think are the best out there right now and we just continue to keep adding to them. David Togut- Evercore ISI : Understood. Happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Thanks. Same to you. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Sir your line is open. Jason Kupferberg-Jefferies: Thanks. Good morning guys. Hi, I just wanted to start with a follow-up question on the checks per client, I know you said that you expect the slowdown to continue in the second half, what\u2019s your sense of kind of where it will actually bottom-up, I know you are still trying to get to the root cause here, but do you think it could even go negative and anything you can give us in terms of sort of revenue sensitivity when this metric moves by I don\u2019t know 50 basis points or 100 basis points? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Okay. So checks per payroll when you start getting down below 1%, there is a lot of variability in that number and it\u2019s affected by the mix of what\u2019s happening with new clients compared to other clients that are trading out of the base. I think we are reaching some sort of steady-state here where that number will oscillate between flat and 1%. That seems to be consistent with what we are seeing in terms of our small business index numbers and seems to be implying and its fair \u2013 you have to be careful because this is one quarter of data. It seems to be implying that you are reaching some sort of more moderate state of employment in the small market space. We had two or three years of really strong checks per payroll and employment growth in the small business space it seems like that\u2019s starting to moderate. The impact on revenue, so what I would like to say is if you have about a point growth in checks that\u2019s typically going to give you anywhere from 25 basis points to 50 basis points depending on the mix in revenue, so it should be relatively modest. And we should settle in somewhere in that range. Jason Kupferberg-Jefferies: And that would be specifically for the core payroll? Efrain Rivera : Yes. It mostly affects payroll service revenue, yes. Jason Kupferberg-Jefferies: But the 25 to 50 bps is specific to that line, not total revenue? Efrain Rivera : Yes, that\u2019s correct. Yes, that\u2019s correct, sorry. Jason Kupferberg-Jefferies: Okay, just wanted to clarify that. And then\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Go ahead, finish. Jason Kupferberg-Jefferies: No, I had another question, but then you want to finish your answer. So just on the CPA referral channel, I know you had mentioned last quarter that you were penetrating some newer CPAs, but I wanted to see if there is any update in terms of latest data on percent of your new sales coming from the CPA network or what percent of them are exclusive to Paychex for payroll referrals and is there any uptick in competition for this channel? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think it\u2019s been pretty consistent competition in the channel. What we were \u2013 what we have done is kind of changed the sales force around a bit to have some CPA centric reps, so where we have a lot of concentration of CPAs. In the past we hadn\u2019t done that. We have been pretty clean on the territory of who own the territory and kind of everything in it. So we have added more dedicated reps just to that CPA channel. I think it\u2019s early in that process, but we continue to get a majority of our referrals, majority \u2013 a large sense of our referrals from CPAs. And that\u2019s been fairly consistent at times. I think it\u2019s competitive I think it\u2019s picked up may be a little bit from a competitive standpoint meaning from one competitor there is really not many that come after that channel. It\u2019s really two of us. And I think there has probably been a little bit more competition from incentive to the CPA I guess I would say. But we are still \u2013 I still feel good about that. And I think we will have the best sense of that after third quarter. Jason Kupferberg-Jefferies: That\u2019s fair. Just last question on the margins, exclude income obviously running around 39% through the first half of the year, you have got the typical I guess seasonal headwinds in the second half. I know you are still endorsing the full year range of 37% to 38%, but should we be thinking about the upper part of that range being more likely or does it feel more like kind of right down the middle sort of year? Efrain Rivera : It feels right down the middle sort of year right now, Jason. Jason Kupferberg-Jefferies: Okay. Okay, thank you guys. Happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. George Mihalos of Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is open. George Mihalos- Credit Suisse : Great, good morning guys. Efrain, I know you don\u2019t want to get too specific as it relates to pricing, but I think on the first quarter call, you had mentioned that pricing trends were kind of trending toward the midpoint of your 2% to 4% range. Would you care to update that at all or? Efrain Rivera : I would care to reiterate what I say. George Mihalos- Credit Suisse : Okay, perfect. That\u2019s\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Yes. I think what we see George is very consistent there. So, we are holding, we really feel like we are holding the price and the price increase and nothing has really changed in Q2 from Q1. George Mihalos- Credit Suisse : Okay. And then I know its early days here in the selling season, but would you categorize what you are seeing so far as ahead of expectations in line with your expectations? Martin Mucci : It\u2019s hard to say. I think I would say certainly in line if not a little positive, a little above, but it\u2019s early, but you never know especially in the small business market, because so much of it is done at the last minute and we get a lot of sales in at the last minute, but right now, I would say certainly at expectations or a little above. George Mihalos- Credit Suisse : Okay. And just last question for me, I just want to make sure I understand it, the deferment of some payroll revenue from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Can you just remind us again what\u2019s driving that and have we seen that before or is something going on here that\u2019s a little different? Efrain Rivera : Well, yes, so let me explain that in two ways. So, if you look at last year\u2019s results in payroll service revenue, we started the year relatively low 2.4 accelerated in Q2 and Q3 and then ended the year at 3. That had to do with days. This really didn\u2019t have anything to do with days compare. It\u2019s simply that cutoffs in a given quarter may affect where revenue falls on the edge of one quarter or another. We looked at \u2013 there is 14 revenue streams that comprised payroll service revenue as we looked at it. Our best estimate is that some revenue that we would otherwise see in Q3, because of timing it\u2019s going to fall in Q4 of this quarter. So, it didn\u2019t happen, it doesn\u2019t always happen, but if you look at the payroll service revenue line over the last couple of years, we see it bouncing up and down, not because it\u2019s that variable, but timing can affect it, days can affect it and that\u2019s why I caution that you really need to look at the year as a whole. George Mihalos- Credit Suisse : Okay. Thanks guys and happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Thanks. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Sir, your line is open. Joseph Foresi-Janney Montgomery Scott : Hi. I guess my first question here is could you give us some sense of what the client growth was like this quarter? I know you talked about the checks per payroll, but I was wondering how is that been trending? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So, Joe what we said was we had a goal of growing clients 1% to 3%. We certainly feel pretty comfortable about where we are in that range and we got off to a good start through the first 6 months. Feel like we are on track in terms of where we expect to be in the year in that range. Joseph Foresi-Janney Montgomery Scott : Got it. And then on the year-over-year revenue growth has ticked up over the last couple of quarters, can you give us a sense of how much of that is associated with this, I guess either new business or penetrating your own businesses versus the general macro backdrop? Efrain Rivera : Well, I think it\u2019s probably a little bit of all. When I am asked that question, I say we could statistically say its 95% execution. The reality is you need a better environment. So, the environment is better. Our execution is better. Pricing is a little bit better. And the opportunity in the under 50 space overall was better and we are executing better against it. So, I think it\u2019s a mix of all of those issues. I would say though that our execution on the sales side has been really strong. And it\u2019s been strong for a number of quarters now and we feel pretty comfortable about where we are positioned competitively. Martin Mucci : Yes, I agree. Joseph Foresi-Janney Montgomery Scott : Are there any, I mean, I guess just two parts to the last question, any metrics that you can provide that you would like to share with us about the execution on the sales front. And then the second part of that question and it\u2019s more of a competitive one, a lot of potential competitors have gone public, are you seeing them in the general arena or any change in the competitive environment? Martin Mucci : I will take the last part and then turn over to Efrain and I think we have seen the \u2013 certainly some of the more competitors showing up in that mid-market space in particular. And but I think we are doing well against them. In fact we have \u2013 they are going to pick off some clients at some point because they are new in the market and they have got something to show. What we have done is started to win back some already which we think is a very positive thing. And overall it\u2019s not having any sizable difference to us. So I think while they are out there, I think we have invested very well in the past particularly past three or four years and it rolled out a lot of products now that I think has positioned us very well against competitors. So I don\u2019t \u2013 while they out there, we still have the widest breadth of services to offer and certainly the best service and service options along with the mobility. And when you think about all the interconnection, it depends on the client, but when you think about all of the service offerings that we have to connect you and a platform of 401(k) payroll HR administration, time and attendance, etcetera it makes us a much better from a competitive standpoint. Efrain you\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Actually other thing Joe is that we call it out in the press release what we don\u2019t give the specifics when we get to year end you can calculate the number. We talk about revenue per check and revenue per check is a combination of number of things that obviously includes pricing. But I think what you are seeing there is sales to a little bit bigger client on the core payroll side and more sales of the precisely the kinds of products that Marty just mentioned to that sales force. Our cross-selling abilities have never been better and our team selling has never been better. So I think it\u2019s all of those working in combination. And while it\u2019s easy to look at just what\u2019s happening in payroll service revenue and ignore what\u2019s happening in the HRS, the reality is that there you have to look at both and our growth rate is a combination of ability to do both of those things well. Joseph Foresi-Janney Montgomery Scott : Thanks. Happy holidays. Efrain Rivera : Sure same to you. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Sir, your line is open. Kartik Mehta- Northcoast Research : Hey, good morning Marty and Efrain. Martin Mucci : Good morning Kartik. Kartik Mehta- Northcoast Research : Both of you talked about selling season being good and I think you have given some thoughts behind why and I was wondering if you look at the fundamentals or at least the fundamentals you will look at to determine this will be a good selling season or not. How have those trended and what are some of those fundamentals that you would look at that kind of predict how the selling season is going to go? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think one \u2013 at this early stage you will \u2013 obviously you look at submitted we don\u2019t get into that amount of detail, but you look at what kind of sales have been submitted already. And as Efrain mentioned that\u2019s not only payroll but that\u2019s the PEO business, the 401(k) business, etcetera because you will get a sense of those a little bit earlier and even then small business payroll and things look pretty solid to us. The other thing you look at is what\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a little more subject to what\u2019s the pulse of the sales folks and the sales leadership and it\u2019s pretty strong right now. As Efrain mentioned we got great teams selling going on, we got retention in good place. We got full reps all out there, all positions are filled, in fact we are a little slightly over so all the positions are up and running. Leads are coming in very well. So I think all those early signs we hate to talk about it until the third quarter is kind of over and you will get a sense of it. But it\u2019s a pretty good sense right now of what we are seeing and again you really to see January to know. But it\u2019s a good sense. And competitively we feel very good. There is not a lot of things that are popping up competitively that are saying, hey there is someone out there with a real aggressive pricing like we have had years ago that was really taking some share at a very low price or high, high discounting or something. We are not seeing anything like that. So we feel we are competing very well and the products are going over really well. The retention also looks good at this point. So you don\u2019t know again. But again retention we are at our best ever and that feels good. Kartik Mehta- Northcoast Research : And then Marty in the press release you talk about the minimum premium health plan that doing really well, is that strictly a reflection of the ACA what your customers are trying to do or are there other drivers helping that business grow? Martin Mucci : I think talking about that plan specifically to the PEO and we introduced it in the last half of last year. I think what that really implies is the PEO is doing well. So, right now in the marketplace, PEOs come on very strong and we certainly have felt that kind of from the end of last year through this year, little slow at the beginning of the year starting, but we seem to picking up great momentum. I think some of the target is definitely healthcare reform. They are looking for the strength of coming into a co-employment position, but I also think we are having great sales execution in the PEO side. We also \u2013 we expanded it. So, we are selling \u2013 while you still sell the majority in PEO kind of \u201cstates,\u201d we are selling it nationwide and we are getting very good sales execution on the PEO side, something we have been in the long time, but we think the product and the sales team are really kind of hitting at their peak right now. Kartik Mehta- Northcoast Research : And then just one last question, Efrain on the float portfolio, any thoughts about changing investment strategy or any other aspects of it considering the rate environment? Efrain Rivera : Yes, you know Kartik, that\u2019s a good question. So, our duration now is 3.2 and our yield is about 1.6% on the long end of the portfolio. You can see if you look at that line that we are ticking up gradually. We obviously invest differently than they repeat us. We don\u2019t push everything out longer term. Look, we have a conversation about that in the spring. We will take a look at it. I don\u2019t anticipate any major changes. We were very, very positive about rate changes 3 to 4 weeks ago. And now, I am thinking that while we will see some rate changes they are going to be moderate. And so you are going to have to think about how you position the portfolio in that environment and we may be there for a longer period of time. So, yes, we will give some thought to that as we get into the back half of the year. I don\u2019t anticipate a significant shift, but it looks like we have got low interest rates here for some more time given the collapse in oil prices. Kartik Mehta- Northcoast Research : And thank you very much. I hope you guys have a great holiday. Efrain Rivera : Thank you too. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open. Gary Bisbee-RBC Capital Markets : Hi, guys. Good morning. Efrain Rivera : Hi, Gary. Gary Bisbee-RBC Capital Markets : I guess on the HRS revenue growth, you have given and I guess you have updated this morning this chart of how adding in the new health plan changes the growth rates and that chart sort of implied 4% acceleration Q1 to Q2 in HRS revenue. Is that really why we see the acceleration or is the underlying momentum in the business adjusting out the impact that the revenue recognition change is having? Is it really picked up momentum? Martin Mucci : We saw some improvement in the second quarter. So, we had versus first quarter Gary. So, we had strong performance literally against every single product line and insurance which started a little soft in the first quarter for us had a good quarter. In the second quarter, we expect that to continue. So, we anticipate that we will continue to have strong performance to the balance of the year. Gary Bisbee-RBC Capital Markets : Okay. And so the deceleration implied in the back half is more just how it flows through and then started to lapse some of that revenue being in last year, not anything about underlying? Martin Mucci : No, no, sorry Gary, I probably misunderstood your question. That\u2019s correct. So, what happens is in the back half, you anniversary the changes in the minimum premium plan. By the time you get to the third quarter, you are getting about roughly about half of the impact and by the time you are in fourth quarter, you have anniversaried it completely. Gary Bisbee-RBC Capital Markets : Great. And then on the PEO and more broadly HRS strength, I mean, there are several competitors that are public now that we see PEO seems to be doing terrific everywhere. Do you have any \u2013 and obviously there seems to be some benefit from health reform, but do you have any fears that sort of demand is being put forward with everyone doing well or it sets up really difficult comparisons once we get into calendar 2015 and more of the mid-market customer they have to be in compliance? And so then you have sort of done that or is this got people really more willing to consider the benefits of this model and you think that the momentum can remain for a while? Efrain Rivera : Yes, at some point the growth itself from PEO will slow down a bit. It\u2019s early to talk about where we are in terms of \u201816, but we have had a strong year and a half with respect to PEO. We will see where we end the year. Marty was mentioning about sales season, sales season and Q3 is important for the PEOs where we end up they will give us a good indication where we are from \u201916. But and I will let Marty talk specifically about employees \u2013 employer shared responsibility which is also an important component of our thought process, but it certainly gets the conversation about PEOs going in a way that probably was different than two or three years ago. Martin Mucci : I think also I would \u2013 as Efrain said obviously when you look year-over-year and when you get into \u201816 there will be tougher comparison on the PEO side, but I think we are very - still very early stage on healthcare reform. As Efrain mentioned our healthcare reform product is just starting to pickup steam now and we really had it in place before anybody a year ago. But with all the delays and the changes in the regulations, I think it took a while to get going. But we are seeing a nice pickup now from healthcare reform whether it\u2019s PEO or not. And I think this will just add to it. So I think it\u2019s still pretty early and I think this will give us some growth for certainly for the rest of this year and then into next year. Gary Bisbee-RBC Capital Markets : Great. And then just one last one, on the strong HRS growth has \u2013 if we look today versus say two or three years ago has the mix of what\u2019s coming up sell to existing customers who may have already been a payroll client versus new customers that just want these services and you sell them because they are interested in the HRS maybe more than being legacy payroll, has that changed at all or is it really the same mix and sales process that you have been executing for\u2026? Martin Mucci : It\u2019s similar, although I think a couple of things have picked up. One, Efrain mentioned insurance and health insurances has picked up particularly recently and so that\u2019s in there and that started to pick up again. I think 401(k) was very strong a few years ago and it\u2019s kind of leveled out, it\u2019s got nice growth, but the fastest growing is HR outsourcing whether it would be the PEO model or the ASO model or our kind of phone support model. All of those I think the HR support has seen the fastest growth in the last two years anyway and that\u2019s picked up a little bit faster in the mix of things. And I think that\u2019s just the fact that you have seen HR outsourcing and the complexity of HR come down in the client base. So where it used to be that was the 50 plus or at least 30 or 40 plus, that\u2019s coming down more and more into where we have a lot of clients. And so I think we have gotten very good at selling the value of HR supports at various levels to smaller clients. And Efrain mentioned earlier, the team\u2019s selling approach that we have gone to which is if a client is of a certain size, we go in with multiple sales teams together on the front end instead of coming at them after they have payroll I think has also helped to helped to get that growth going higher. Gary Bisbee-RBC Capital Markets : Okay, great. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Thanks. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Tim McHugh of William Blair. Sir you line is open. Tim McHugh- William Blair : Yes. Thanks. I guess can you update us I guess at this point in terms of how much is the sales force or your sales resources kind of up year-over-year as we go into the selling season and is that a fair bogie for how you think about it, I know you said 1% to 3% client growth for this fiscal year, but a lot of that was dictated by last selling season, so I am trying to get a sense for how we should ballpark kind of what the potential is for this upcoming season in terms of client growth? Martin Mucci : I think from a sales headcount perspective I would say it\u2019s up around 4% maybe 4% plus a little bit, so a little stronger and we were kind of holding constant for a few years. Last year we were up a bit and this year we went up again across the various sales organizations around 4 plus or a little bit over 4% against. Efrain Rivera : I didn\u2019t catch the second question back half\u2026 Tim McHugh- William Blair : And is it fair to think about the target and I guess for client growth would be around that number, I know you said 1% to 3% for this fiscal year, but I would assume most of that was driven by last year\u2019s kind of selling season? Martin Mucci : No, I would that just start by saying, remember that sales team is across all divisions. So it\u2019s not so much on the payroll growth as we have probably seen more increases in the HRS teams as well and also we have moved up some of the virtual sales teams on some of the products like time and attendance and merchant services and so forth as well. So it\u2019s a mix across that Tim. So I wouldn\u2019t say that that necessarily have given you anything on the client growth. The client growth we still think we are in that 1% to 3%. Okay, Efrain takes over them, yes. Tim McHugh- William Blair : Okay. And then the new PEO or kind of the new health insurance product, I get a lot of the focus, I mean, there is an accounting impact of just adding that in there, but how is the client reaction I guess then as we look back at this point? It feels like it\u2019s been adopted a little more broadly even then you would have thought? And I think the follow-up is how \u2013 what does that imply? I think you only were started doing this in a few markets initially, so do you get more aggressive what\u2019s rolling this out? Martin Mucci : Yes, sorry go ahead. Tim McHugh- William Blair : No, that\u2019s it. Martin Mucci : I think of it as really two different. I just don\u2019t want to mix up two different things there. There is the healthcare plan, where we took on more in the PEO and that was primarily in Florida and that\u2019s the market that we are trying it there. So, you are right there, we are doing in Florida. We are getting good feedback on that. It gives us more flexibility on the rates and in the whole process of how we sell and so forth, we have gotten good feedback on that and that\u2019s part of our PEO growth I believe that you will see continue. On the healthcare reform specifically, we have introduced the product across the country and that\u2019s not just PEO, that\u2019s to all clients and its various products of helping them, but primarily helping them understand and give them reporting on the number of clients that they have as full-time equivalents whether healthcare reapplies to them. If it does apply to them, do they have all of the right things in place and how are they going to file the requirements of the health \u2013 of the Affordable Care Act. So, I would say both, they are a little bit different. I don\u2019t know if you were combining them or not, but the PEO is going well there in Florida in particular. We reintroduced that plan. And then the healthcare reform products as we talk about there is really the reporting and the compliance and that\u2019s across the country and that\u2019s really this second quarter just started to really start to pickup some steam. So, we are anxious to see how Q3 goes. Tim McHugh- William Blair : Okay, right. Yes, I was talking more of the Florida product I guess what would you want to see to take that more broadly across the rest of the country? Martin Mucci : It\u2019s just a matter of Tim you get the right plans in place and is the risk reasonable for us to take on. This is where we are taking on more of the risk ourselves and we felt it was certainly a very big PEO market when you think of really two or three key states for PEO at least right now. That was a good one to take on. It was worth it because of the size of the market, the number of sales we have there and of course the plan we are able to get and workout through the Florida Blue. So, we continue to look at those all the time and we are looking at them around the country as to whether that\u2019s the right move or not. It\u2019s the combination of all those things. Tim McHugh- William Blair : Okay. And if I could slip in one more, there is just this weak news of a new legislation around that PEO sector in terms of having some certification and you are kind of clarifying some of the tax simplifications of adopting a PEO I believe. Can you give us your thoughts on, is that meaningful as you think about the growth of that business? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So, you are talking about, I think it\u2019s called SPEA, another great government acronym. At the margin, it\u2019s positive for PEOs. It recognizes them as an important solution within the marketplace. There was some ambiguity about how the government was going to look at PEOs. And we think that it\u2019s just going to make the attractiveness of that offering greater in the marketplace, where we are digesting all of the provisions of the legislation, but we think at this point our compliance group, legal group think it\u2019s going to be positive for a PEO. Tim McHugh- William Blair : Okay, great. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Take care. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open. Smitti Srethapramote- Morgan Stanley : Thank you. Good morning, Marty and Efrain. So, there has been lot of tension on the growth in the FSA and HSA\u2019s accounts in the U.S. Can you talk about what role you expect Paychex to play going forward whether it\u2019s continuing to work with partners or becoming more directly involved and how big an opportunity could this market be? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think FSA has come under some pressure because of some of the changes on it and so forth in legislation and the deductibility of it and everything. I think that\u2019s going to slowdown a little bit. I think HSAs will become stronger. I think that what you will see there is it gives us more opportunity, because I need more health plans and this could be through the agency as well through our insurance agency, you will see more health plans go more toward HSAs. They are going more toward obviously the high deductibles and then giving HSA money to employees. I think it\u2019s an opportunity for us. I don\u2019t know how \u2013 if it\u2019s going to be a major impact at this point, but and I think you will see us do a combination of and probably always partnering to some degree with it because of the back room requirements of it, it just makes more sense sometimes to partner than to build. But we have been in FSA for a long time. I think we will be able to handle it very well and we will be \u2013 it will continue to be part of our package. Smitti Srethapramote- Morgan Stanley : Great. And then maybe just a follow-up on the partnerships that you have developed where the companies like [indiscernible] can you talk about how payment and payment processing is going and if there is any other type of \u2013 similar types of partnerships in the pipeline? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think the [indiscernible] partnership is going well. We were a little slow on it of the gate. On the selling and merchant services, I think we felt that the field sales would be able to sell that well and they were first in for some new businesses and so they will be able to sell it. It turns out, we learned a lot in different trials on that that it\u2019s a complicated pricing structure based on your type of business and so forth and very competitive. So what we found was we now have the field sales team refer back into an internal team, which we increased the size this year and they are doing very well. So we have gotten some real traction this year on the inside team that sells basically virtually. So the field sales refers it back and inside team will then talk to the client and sells their credit card the merchant processing. And that started to pickup some real steam. Now, it takes a lot of clients given the commission structures there to have substantial revenue given our revenue size. But we do think it\u2019s got great momentum and we are continuing to see that. So it\u2019s been a nice partnership and I think it\u2019s starting to take off. Other partnerships like that, can\u2019t think of too many other than Paychex accounting online. We have invested in with Kashoo in their Paychex accounting online. Again a little slow getting going. I think we are learning a lot about the marketing of the product and how to integrate it more into the marketing. Our clients still view us very much as the human resource outsource \u2013 human capital management, payroll and HR and time and attendance and getting them to view us as an accounting offering as well with the Kashoo product has been slower than we thought. So we are learning on that. But we are always open to that. And of course Brazil is a 50-50 partnership with Semco down there to help us get started. And I think just starting in January we are off to a pretty good start. I wouldn\u2019t give a client count at this point, but it\u2019s starting to pick up traction as well and we feel very good about that decision. Smitti Srethapramote- Morgan Stanley : Thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Efrain Rivera : Thanks. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the lines of Ms. Sara Gubins of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Ma\u2019am, your line is open. Sara Gubins-Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I had a question about the new platform, I had a chance to take a look at it at the recent HR tech conference and was particularly interested by the Flex enterprise platform for larger clients, I know it\u2019s really early, but I am wondering what the feedback has been from the sales force in early demos and if you think that is now fully competitive with some of the via more recent entrance at least from \u2013 to the public market? Thanks. Martin Mucci : Yes, I think we do \u2013 obviously we have been able to show it at some of the shows and the sales force is really picking up steam on it now. I think we sold another platform for a long time, so there was a lot of learning there and we have been enhancing it very quickly. The thing that changes so quickly today is when you release something almost every month there is a new release that\u2019s adding something to it. And so that\u2019s probably been the biggest challenge for the sales force is all the changes to it that we have been adding. That\u2019s a good thing because its added enhancements, we have gotten good feedback on it. I think the clients really like the way it shows the user interface is very simple and very direct for them. We are working on integrating more and more of the other products that we have into that. So it\u2019s \u2013 there is a full suite of products and combined with that great user interface and the mobility platform and multiple products that are going anywhere from recruiting on boarding to payroll to HR administration time and attendance, all of that\u2019s bundled in and we are giving more service options now with between user interface to mobility and 7x24 client service. I think the differentiator will be technology to some degree, but it will also be the great service that we can provide that I don\u2019t think anyone else is focused on. So it\u2019s getting good traction with the sales force and we are anxious to see the January results. Sara Gubins-Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks. Following up kind of on that theme of being able to do payroll in a lot of different forms, given all of the objects that you have been making to mobile and your platforms, are you starting to see \u2013 are you continuing to see a shift towards more online entry as opposed to phone and fax? Is there anything appreciable really happening there? And if there is do you think that we might see an operating margin benefit over time from that? Martin Mucci : I think we are seeing some shift towards that. And it\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s particularly we just saw like a big shift on mobility for like the holiday, for Thanksgiving. So, you are seeing it around certain times where \u2013 which is exactly what we like where the client has a choice each and every week or every other week whenever they do payroll. They can go mobility this week. They can go online next week. They always have their dedicated personalized service to fallback on whenever they need it and they can just call up and give their payroll over the phone as well. So, we are seeing some shift, but the thing that we are seeing that\u2019s very positive to us is that clients are using the multitude of options available to them, which is what we wanted to give. We don\u2019t want to force them to online. We don\u2019t want to force them away from a payroll specialist who gives us the great retention numbers that we have. So, I think there certainly has been some opportunities there and you will see us with our industry leading margins, you will see us continue to find ways to keep those. You may find us reinvesting as we have the last 4 years though right back into technology, because it\u2019s going to be this combination of service and technology that makes us successful. Sara Gubins-Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Great. And then just last quick question, last quarter you talked about an uptick in sales to new startups, you mentioned here it continued to strengthen under 50 and I am wondering if that sales to startups continued this quarter? Martin Mucci : Yes, it did. We are continuing to see a positive uptick compared to last year. And so we are still seeing that the new business startups as you know I am sure still are not back to what they were pre-recession levels, but they certainly have ticked up over 700,000. They are just not quite back up from what everything we see or back up over that 800,000 level kind of countrywide. So, we are encouraged that we are seeing more sales from new businesses and that\u2019s always been a big part of our business. So, yes that has continued in Q2. Sara Gubins-Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks very much. Martin Mucci : Okay. Efrain Rivera : Thank you, Sara. Operator : Thank you, ma\u2019am. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open. Bryan Keane- Deutsche Bank : Hey, guys. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I just want to look at big picture, maybe Marty, when you look at payroll services growth and HR services growth and you look at the guidance, is that the right model to growth rates or you are leaving some growth on the table, just kind of how do you think about the big picture as we go out for the next couple of years? Martin Mucci : Well, is it the right model? I think we will always see the HR service revenue growth growing faster. And I think that the good thing is there, Bryan is that we have got a lot of opportunity for when you think of the penetration rates that we are at. So, even as long as we have been in this business and successful at selling into that base, we still have low penetration rates in a lot of services right from 401(k) to insurances and so forth. So, I think you will always see that, that growth is higher. I think the interesting thing approaching $1 billion in revenue in HRS is really exciting to us and going well beyond that. Payroll service revenue growth is always to be somewhat tied to the economy, but we feel like we are executing well on everything that we can control. And I think you will see frankly a blending more of that. It won\u2019t be so much about how much is payroll service revenue growth and how much is HRS growth, but how much is the combined service revenue growth. And we are trying to continue to drive that to upper \u2013 into a consistent upper single-digits kind of place to be. And given that, then keep those margins up and expanding and we have got something very unique here. So, we are excited about how we are executing and certainly about the opportunity in front of us. Bryan Keane- Deutsche Bank : What the acquisition pipeline look like? And is there any appetite to take on larger deals moving forward? Martin Mucci : Yes, there is. We have come close on a few. I think that the tricky thing is the valuation. A lot of these things in the pipeline are priced or valued at almost what I would say is a perfect acquisition. So, it doesn\u2019t leave you a lot of room for error in our opinion. We have been very successful at the product tuck-ins and the acquisitions like SurePayroll that we have done. And so we are very careful about what we acquired, but the pipeline is pretty good. It\u2019s just the valuations got to be right or we are just \u2013 we are not going to do it. But we have got the cash and the flexibility. And I think we got a nice track record of executing. So we are pretty aggressive about looking at everything that\u2019s out there right now. Bryan Keane- Deutsche Bank : And would everything be in kind of the HR area or is there certain other maybe verticals that you guys will look at? Martin Mucci : I would say pretty much anything that we are into right now would be in our space, so anything from payroll to PEO and product tuck-ins but certainly larger deals as well. And like I said we have come pretty close. But the valuations are pretty steep and so again if we don\u2019t feel like we can make that difference we are going to be pretty disciplined in our pricing. Bryan Keane- Deutsche Bank : Okay. That\u2019s all I had. Happy holidays. Thanks Martin. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Same to you. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Jim MacDonald of First Analysis. Sir, your line is open. Jim MacDonald- First Analysis : Yes. Good morning guys, just a couple of quick follow-ups. On the HRS growth as I remember right, the 401(k) restatements has \u2013 had some impacts in the quarter, could you talk about that and was it confine to this quarter? Efrain Rivera : Jim, it\u2019s part of your decision on pricing. HRS was strong for in virtually every single line. You make a decision as to whether you want to take that pricing or not, but in the 401(k) business in particular, we had higher assets are moved to bigger plans and that certainly played some part in it and will continue to play a part for the remainder of the year, but that\u2019s not the sole thing driving growth in that business. Jim MacDonald- First Analysis : Right, I was just trying to figure out that was a little more than normal this quarter? Efrain Rivera : It was a little bit more than normal this quarter, but again 401(k) part of the way that we make money in that business is a number of different streams and all them were up. Jim MacDonald- First Analysis : Great. And another follow-up, so just on the new Flex product, could you talk a little bit more about what your primary or where you think it will sell the best which size range of customer? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think we are seeing mostly anywhere from 20 and up, 15 to 20 and up is probably going to be seeing that the most this is where they \u2013 the good news is I think that\u2019s probably been lower than we had expected for a full suite of the products. Now Flex can encompass as little as payroll and as large as the entire suite. And so I think that \u2013 but overall when you see multiple products being purchased as a bundle it\u2019s in that 20 plus which is I think a little stronger than we expected. And I think that that\u2019s because again that the market is changing and things are coming down. The need for HR administration, time and attendance particularly as the technologies made it better we just introduced Paychex Time which I mentioned. And you know here is a mobile punch that now allows you to go in and punch and actually keep the punch, keep your time open on your mobile phone for 70 \u2013 up to 72 hours, so you don\u2019t have to login again, get into your mobile app as an employee and then punch in. You can actually leave it open for multiple time periods. As that stuff gets easier and easier we are findings smaller businesses are finding big benefits. We are able to sell them on the big benefit. So we are excited about Flex and the fact that they kind of bundles all this together along with the service options. It\u2019s appealing to 20 and above, but certainly has some \u2013 it certainly fits even below that? Jim MacDonald- First Analysis : Great. Happy holidays guys. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Same to you. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. David Grossman of Stifel Financial. Sir, your line is open. David Grossman- Stifel Financial : Thank you. Good morning. Efrain Rivera : David, good morning. David Grossman- Stifel Financial : Just a couple of very quick follow-ups, I was just wondering. I assume you track some of tracking of revenue per clients and I am wondering if you could help us understand how that has been trending given all the changes in the underlying services and some of the enhancements to the products that you are making to kind of accommodate a bundled type of sale? Efrain Rivera : Yes. It\u2019s been trending positively David. I think that what Marty was saying earlier about team selling and cross-selling, I think we have just gotten much better at understanding what a client\u2019s needs are based on size, putting the right set of solutions in front of them and because we have breadth of service \u2013 I am sorry breadth of product offering that\u2019s pretty unrivaled, we can typically get a client the solution they need from the first instance, which is a little different than what we are doing probably 4, 5 years ago where we would wait for payroll and then do the sale sequentially. So, look I wait till the end of the year to quantify it, but we are pretty pleased in terms of the revenue uplift that we have been getting per client. So, what that implies is that, that the game no longer has just simply got units and then add ancillaries, which is what we talked about 5, 6 years ago? It\u2019s really get the revenue on initial sale for the right kind of client and we are executing pretty well against that strategy. David Grossman- Stifel Financial : Is there anyway you can disaggregate how much of that phenomenon is contributing to your growth rate? And I guess on the same line, can you help us understand the margin profile of those clients versus what they look like historically [indiscernible] payroll and other services on top of it? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So, margin profile is not significantly different than what we have seen historically. If you go back 4, 5 years, our operating income net of flow was about 400 basis points lower than it is right now. So, we obviously have been able to execute that strategy and grow margins at the same time. That\u2019s one. To disaggregate it, I need to give you year end client data and then you need to compute what average revenue per client is. So, you can get a sense of that if you do that analysis from last year. I won\u2019t \u2013 we will probably update that at the end of the year, but we are getting the pretty nice revenue uplift. And the issue is that we think that, that we can continue to execute that strategy into the future. David Grossman- Stifel Financial : And maybe just a related question as it relates to the margin, as you think about these acquisitions that are out there and I know valuation separate issue, but as you think about that as well as some of the enhancements you are making to the platform and some of these newer segments that you are going after, is the company perhaps thinking more holistically about kind of the margin in terms of that balance between growth and margin or has there really been no change internally about that? Martin Mucci : Well, yes, sure I mean, I think we are always looking at \u2013 we are trying to get that upper \u2013 consistent upper single-digit growth in the top line and continue to be very shareholder friendly on the bottom. And so I have the high margins, but it is a balance. If we see a good opportunity to drive growth that might hurt the margin a little bit, then we would \u2013 we are not going to hesitate to do that. It\u2019s always going be a balance. So, we want to drive both, but if in the short-term, it hurts you a little bit, I think we are willing to be able to do that. So, we are investing I think we have been very successful at over the last particularly 4 years is driving margin improvement and also investing it very heavily in technology and I see it along the same lines. We drove cost out of operations who got very productive, tried new things and still got us a great client retention and satisfaction and we funneled out those dollars into technology, where we were behind 4, 5 years ago and put us in a great spot from a technology position now and a competitive situation. So, we see the same thing with an acquisition. Hey, if we are going to take it or it takes on some additional expense, where also we are going to be able to cut to be able to offset it. David Grossman- Stifel Financial : Right. And just one last thing then going to the international expansion, this has been a long road for you guys starting in Germany years ago and you now have this joint venture in Brazil. I mean are you getting any more encouraged or less encouraged about the ability for the model to be expanded outside the U.S. and could you share any insights into kind of where it heads out in terms of kind of taking this into other geographies? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think we\u2019d like to as a team we talked about the strategy a few years ago and decided hey, look let\u2019s try to pinpoint 3 or 4 countries perhaps, let\u2019s get our thing, let\u2019s get it growing. I think there wasn\u2019t a focus on it for quite a while. It was kind of a nice idea, but it was not always a focus. We have started focusing on it. We have really doubled the size of Germany through acquisition and through additional sales people. So, we are pretty encouraged there and think that there is still opportunity there, but it has moved slower than we expected, but frankly the culture is slower to still outsource than we had expected. But so we feel pretty good about the fact that I think acquisitions are opening up as well as the opportunities for sales there. In Brazil having only been there less than a year really I think we have learned a lot. It\u2019s also a little bit slow to come out from the CPA or the client doing it. So we have worked a very good process and with becoming the CPA\u2019s back room. I think that's brought down the revenue per client less than we expected, but it\u2019s helped to accelerate the growth in blocks. So you go to a CPA and you take their business, you build credibility with the CPA then we will move into the direct sales to the client because we will have market share and credibility and that\u2019s actually picking up some nice traction. And Semco has helped I think knowing Brazil and partnering that was a different approach than Germany, where we kind of it took us a long time because we did it ourselves. And then we are still looking at one or two countries where we can get in either through acquisition or startup primarily probably through acquisition. And we think we are trying to build it to where it\u2019s meaningful to our revenue which is difficult given where we are growing, but I still think it\u2019s a nice opportunity. David Grossman- Stifel Financial : Okay, very good. Thanks for that and have a very nice holiday. Martin Mucci : Thanks David. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line to Mr. Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open. Efrain Rivera : Hi Jeff. Jeff Silber-BMO Capital Markets : Thanks so much. And I know it\u2019s late actually wanted to ask one question. Efrain I think you had mentioned earlier the potential impact of oil prices on your stocks regarding interest rates, are there any \u2013 is there any other impact potentially on the rest of the business from the decline in oil prices? Efrain Rivera : No, I highlighted that because obviously it\u2019s had an impact on the Fed\u2019s thinking around interest rates. I was just reading an article before the call around what they expect to see in terms of consumer uplift. It\u2019s hard to peg any of that to have a direct impact on our business. So no, it shouldn\u2019t have an impact. Martin Mucci : We are hoping that it brings up at least in the short-term some consumer confidence which may gives them some discretionary income to spend and it might bring small businesses up, but it\u2019s going to help small businesses a bit as it works through depending on the business. And so hopefully it has some positive impact, but we haven\u2019t seen too much yet. Jeff Silber-BMO Capital Markets : And do you have any specific geographic exposure to the states in the U.S. that have a lot of energy production? Martin Mucci : We are seeing that overall from our small business index. We are seeing that the Central part of the U.S. is where we are seeing the best small business job growth because you are seeing increased jobs in the drilling and fracking and so forth and that\u2019s the Central. It\u2019s anywhere from Texas to North Dakota. So it\u2019s interesting that they are having kind of the best job growth right now where the costs have come down some. But I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s had any dramatic effect, but I think that it\u2019s been a positive but mostly in the Central U.S. Jeff Silber-BMO Capital Markets : Yes, I was actually looking at it from the opposite perspective with the decline in oil prices if you have seen a slowdown in job growth there? Martin Mucci : Not that we seen, no. Not \u2013 we have not seen that. Jeff Silber-BMO Capital Markets : Alright. Thanks so much. Happy holidays. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of S.K. Prasad Borra of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open. S.K. Prasad Borra- Goldman Sachs : My questions, firstly \u2013 Hi, how should we think about revenue per check and probably just following on one of the earlier questions when you think about it, it is dependent on pricing, but also the kind of product portfolio you have, what is the price differential between the most basic versions of products which you are selling compared to a full blown out version. And what kind of penetration levels do you have like if let\u2019s say put 100 figure to the most basic product to say 20% or 30% penetration of the full portfolio, so if you could probably give any numbers around that, that would be helpful? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Well, S.K. I think the best way, let me start with the end and then come back to revenue per check. So obviously, we think that revenue per check has been going up and will continue to grow. If you look at each of the product lines we have and I say this frequently, Marty does too that we have about 10% on average of the base penetrated right now, that\u2019s what\u2019s generating the HRS revenue. So I will let you figure out your model what that equates to, but certainly we think 10% is pretty underpenetrated for the base. And there is probably multiples of that kind of opportunity that exists within the base ignoring whether you get growth in the base, which we think will get over time. With respect to each of the products, it really \u2013 it really \u2013 it depends on the product. When you attach an HR outsourcing solution to a payroll client, you are getting multiple Xs of that payroll clients\u2019 revenue and that ranges anywhere from 1x to 2x on a 401(k) plan as I said to multiple Xs of that payroll revenue in an HR outsourcing solution. So, it really will vary depending on where the opportunity is and the rate of penetration by products, but we think we still have a long way to go in terms of getting to a point where we have saturated the base with the suite of products that we have. S.K. Prasad Borra- Goldman Sachs : Okay. And just one other question, for the last few years, you have been exactly investing in products and a point which Marty was mentioning about continuous investments in technology and this year you have invested quite a lot around sales and marketing. So, when do you expect a more normalized investment here? Is it going to be FY \u201816, FY \u201817 yes, any views on that? Martin Mucci : I think you will always see some growth from a sales and marketing perspective. I think just to keep up with the competitive environment I think it\u2019s fairly normalized. It wasn\u2019t a huge increase in sales and marketing, but I think when things have kind of at a normal pace, we are typically trying to grow the sales force by 3% or so. From a technology standpoint, the increase \u2013 the level of increase has slowed and I think it will be what you can always spend millions more on technology. I think we have got a great product portfolio and roadmap that we invest in and then tried to slowdown the increase of spending, but the level of spending will probably stay relatively the same. So, I think we are in kind of a normalized \u2013 we are kind of heading into a normalized period right now. S.K. Prasad Borra- Goldman Sachs : Thank you. That\u2019s pretty much from my end. Martin Mucci : Take care, S.K. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Mark Marcon of R.W. Baird. Sir, your line is open. Mark Marcon-R.W. Baird: Happy holidays Marty and Efrain. Martin Mucci : Thanks Mark. Mark Marcon-R.W. Baird: Couple of quick questions. Just on the PEO side when you are getting new clients, are you typically seeing brand new clients to the overall solution or what \u2013 or how many of the new clients that you are getting are competitive takeaways. How would you describe that? Martin Mucci : I think I would say it\u2019s kind of 50 :50. I think we are selling into the base as well as brand new clients on the PEO concept. So, I would say probably it varies month to month, but probably around 50 :50 is fair. I think we are putting a little bit more emphasis on brand new clients, because I think there is a real opportunity out there. I think our sales force is executing well and really can sell the benefits of the PEO to a brand new client and it\u2019s part of as Efrain has mentioned a number of times this kind of team selling. So, you don\u2019t necessarily have to go in and just sell them payroll. Are old model is selling them a complete suite if they need it and value it. And so you will see us focus probably some reps just on PEO selling outside the base. Mark Marcon-R.W. Baird: Great. And I mean obviously there is a couple of states that are well-penetrated in terms of the outside of those core two, three states that are really well-penetrated. Are you seeing an increasing level of acceptance of the PEO concept? Martin Mucci : Yes. And I think this legislation that Efrain mentioned earlier may accelerate that a little bit too, but I think so yes, we are typically Florida, Texas, let\u2019s say Georgia, I think even New York now is starting to pick up and some other states that we really haven\u2019t seen that much growth before. So, I think there is more acceptance and I think the legislation will make that even better. Mark Marcon-R.W. Baird: Great. And then on the competitive takeaways on the PEO side, what\u2019s the primary reason why somebody would come to you from a competitive perspective? Martin Mucci : I think the insurance plans that we have I think as well as the service and then the technology of the product that you have. And I think when you look at a few of us that are in the PEO business, I mean, there is only a few that really have that wide breadth of that. Also there is you have really got to count on somebody large and I think sometimes people go into these, there is a lot of small PEOs, I think clients go in there thinking they are going to get something that in the end, they can\u2019t provide from service and technology perspective. And just safety I guess I would say of the insurance plan. So I mean it\u2019s a combination of product offering, technology service and strength of the company behind it. Mark Marcon-R.W. Baird: Great. And so when we \u2013 with the supplemental schedule that you provided when we take a look at the fourth quarter number for HRS is \u2013 do we have a full comp in, in terms of the insurance so that the fourth quarter is kind of indicative of the longer term growth rate to expect out of HRS? Efrain Rivera : Okay. You are good you had me until that last statement. So I can\u2019t give you next year\u2019s guidance, but Q4 certainly is indicative of a full compare. I would hesitate, Mark to say that simply because we are having \u2013 we have been having a very strong year in PEO. When we do our plan we will figure that out. I don\u2019t anticipate it will be quite that strong. Mark Marcon-R.W. Baird: Okay. So but we do have the full compare in terms of the insurance plans, but the factor to think about is that even though Q4 has that full compare, we are then going up against a really strong year and so therefore there should be some, but \u2013 so let\u2019s say that we end up being 100-200 basis points lower than that fourth quarter number, does that seem like a pretty good long sustainable? Efrain Rivera : Mark so my answer, you deplorably is that we target around double digit for HRS and year-to-year that can vary a little bit, but that\u2019s kind of what we are trying to get to. Mark Marcon-R.W. Baird: Got it. And then you said something interesting on the core payroll side which is that you are already starting to see some clients come back to you from some of the newer solutions, can you give a little more color around that? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think what we have seen, it\u2019s a small sample set, but we have seen is the service model being probably the biggest impact. I think what selling some of the new companies that have come out is user interface and technology might look good to them. The service model has not been as complete or as strong as I think as they expect. And some clients see service as possibly a commodity as there going in and it doesn\u2019t turn out to be that way. When you think of the breadth and experience that Paychex has versus some of the startups and the rate that they are trying to grow you are going to have service issues. And I think that\u2019s been the primary thing that\u2019s driven back to us. Mark Marcon-R.W. Baird: Great. And then on the new clients that you are getting, are they typically on the smaller end of your range or the higher end of your \u2013 and I am talking about on that under 20 core side? Martin Mucci : It will be over the 20, it will be more in that mid-market space, anywhere 20 to 200 really. Mark Marcon-R.W. Baird: Alright. I wasn\u2019t referring to the ones that are coming back, I just meant in terms of the overall client growth that you mentioned the 1% to 3%...? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Some markets skewing smaller. Mark Marcon-R.W. Baird: Yes. What I meant was, is it relative to where it\u2019s been historically, is it skewing even smaller? Martin Mucci : I can\u2019t really answer that specific question, but it is in general smaller. Mark Marcon-R.W. Baird: Okay. Great. Happy holidays again. Efrain Rivera : Thanks a lot. Martin Mucci : Thanks Mark. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line the Ms. Lisa Ellis of Sanford Bernstein. Ma\u2019am your line is open. Lisa Ellis- Sanford Bernstein : Terrific, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my call here at the end. If I unpacked the accounting impact, it looks like your underlying apples-to-apples margins are trending up, is that accurate. And can you give some color around that? Efrain Rivera : They trended up from Q1 Lisa. And but \u2013 and I think I was asked earlier kind of where are we in the guidance range, we still think we are in solidly in the middle. We will see. We will update it as we go through quarter to quarter. Lisa Ellis- Sanford Bernstein : Terrific. And then just a follow-up and on the competitive environment in the small business space, you gave a little bit of color earlier around Kashoo and Paychex online \u2013 sorry Paychex accounting online as well as your sort of net win backs that you are seeing from some of the new entrants, can you specifically give some color around into it. They have been pretty aggressive in a lot of their earnings calls talking about their traction in payroll, I would be curious to see your view on that? Martin Mucci : Yes. We have not really seen losses to Intuit. In fact, we have seen as we dug deeper into some of the gains, we have been gaining some from Intuit on a net basis. So, we haven\u2019t seen a big impact there. I do think they go after a little bit different market while people always think that they maybe taking share from us, we don\u2019t see that. We do see they compete more with our SurePayroll, brand and company and SurePayroll is still doing pretty well. So, they still have double-digit client growth and so forth. So, I think they are still doing well and we haven\u2019t seen a big impact from Intuit. So, they maybe getting it more from those who are manual and kind of moving to a software, which is what we see happening with SurePayroll. Lisa Ellis- Sanford Bernstein : Terrific. Thanks, guys. Happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you, ma\u2019am. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. [indiscernible] of JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning guys. Just I will be quick, I know it\u2019s a long call. So, just clarifying on the PEO front, I am curious have you changed your sales philosophy at all with respect to pushing or promoting PEO, it sounds like you had I don\u2019t think, I believe you sell both PEO ASO together. Has that changed? Martin Mucci : No, not really. We sell them \u2013 we do sell them together. I think I did mention though that we do think that there is a growing opportunity for the PEO. And so we are going to look at we are adding some reps that are just PEO centric. So, just kind of dedicated to the PEO, but we are still the vast majority or still selling both products, because we still think we have seen good opportunity in both of them. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks for that clarification. So just the new folks if you are bringing in are dedicated PEO, got it. And then just from the same kind of the clarification, forgive me if I missed this, just on the HRS guidance in the slides where you show the third quarter, fourth quarter guidance, it looks like it changed a little bit. So, what is that, just the math kind of thing? Efrain Rivera : Yes. You know what, [indiscernible], so what ended up happening when we issued the guidance for the beginning of the year, the attach rates on healthcare influence the ranges that\u2019s really basically what\u2019s going on. So, we looked at where we expect to be in the third and fourth quarter and just wanted to tighten the range so that the midpoint obviously is where we think we are going to end up, but that could vary, because attach rates on healthcare can change quarter-to-quarter. It\u2019s really we are being punctilious. Unidentified Analyst : Nice. I like that. Alright, well that\u2019s all I needed. Have a safe year end guys. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, sir. And for our last question, the line comes from the line of Mr. Matt O\u2019Neill of Autonomous Research. Sir, your line is open. Matt O\u2019Neill- Autonomous Research : Yes, hi. Thanks for squeezing me at the end. I was just curious going back to the 1% to 2% client growth, how you guys are thinking about that? It sounds like you kind of answered it already and that the SurePayroll is still growing double-digit just as far as the mix as it starts? Martin Mucci : We don\u2019t really break it down. I think we are seeing growth from both of us. They are a little bit faster. I remember they are much smaller base from where they are coming from. So, we are seeing growth across \u2013 kind of across the board really. Matt O\u2019Neill- Autonomous Research : Got it, okay. And just one last follow-up if you don\u2019t mind, I was just thinking through the kind of profile of the clients that rollout of the Paychex business versus the new sort of class of clients that come in every year. Is that profiling aggregate or different? Is there anything to think about the client that\u2019s leaving the business versus the new client that\u2019s coming in? It sounds like maybe a little bit on the average number of employees coming down a little bit, but aside from that, are there any bigger differences to think about conceptually? Martin Mucci : No, not really. I mean, we track to the last penny revenue we lose the size of client, what products they have and it really hasn\u2019t changed much. Matt O\u2019Neill- Autonomous Research : Okay, thanks very much. Have good holiday. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Operator : And as of this time, sir, there are no further questions. Martin Mucci : Okay, thank you. We will close the call if you are interested in replaying the webcast, it will be archived until around January 19. I thank you for taking the time to participate in our second quarter press release conference call. We are excited about year end, a great time for opportunity to show our clients what we bring them from a service perspective is they closed it year many of them and certainly a big time for us in the selling season. And we are excited about all the work that our Paychex employees are doing. With that, we wish you all a very happy holiday season and thank you for joining us. Efrain Rivera : Take care. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I\u2019d like to turn your call over to Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Mr. Mucci, you may begin. Martin Mucci : Thank you and thank you for joining us for the discussion of Paychex\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2015 earnings results. Joining me today on the call is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2015. We will file our Form 10-Q which provides additional discussion and analysis of the results for the quarter by the end of the day. Our earnings release and Form 10-Q will be available on our Investor Relations page at paychex.com. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month. On today\u2019s call, I will update you on the highlights in our operations, sales and product development areas, Efrain will talk through our third quarter financial results and our guidance as we wrap up fiscal 2015, and then we will open it up for your questions. We were pleased with our third quarter results as we continue to make good progress toward our key initiatives. Our selling season execution was very strong, producing double-digit growth in new annualized revenues sold, we\u2019re pleased with that. We also continued to our success in adding new bank and franchise referral arrangements and increasing our web leads in addition to our CPA referral channel. We remain focused on selling great value to our clients, helping them realize the full breadth of technology and service that Paychex has to offer. Demand for our HR outsourcing solutions continues to advance with gains in both clients and worksite employees. This has made a significant contribution to our double-digit growth in HRS revenue. Payroll service revenue continues to advance as a result of increases in revenue per check and client based growth. Total service revenue increased 8% for the third quarter, 9% for the nine months. As we have expanded our portfolio of SaaS based bundled offerings. Paychex Flex, which includes online time and attendance in HR administration among many other capabilities, we\u2019ve also greatly enhanced our personalized dedicated service. Paychex Flex offers powerful workforce management capabilities in a simple and streamlined user experience. Our new service initiative also offers clients the flexibility of choice for their service needs. This approach gives clients access to a variety of customer service options based on their size and complexity including our 7/24 customer service. Our mobility app continues to see a fast growing number of users both clients and their client employees. This app provides a single, easily accessed mobile source to all of the products and information that the client subscribes to from us. We have continued to add more functionality including last quarter\u2019s web time punch capability. We\u2019re also gaining additional market acceptance of our new full service product to help clients navigate healthcare reform. We are uniquely positioned to leverage payroll data with our nationally recognized insurance agency and our clients assist and offer our clients assistance and value in understanding the requirements of the Affordable Care Act and its impact on their business and employees. We help our clients navigate these complex requirements, avoid fines and penalties and reduce the administrative work necessary to remain in compliance with the law. Our operations team let us through a good year in for our clients producing and distributing W2s ahead of schedule and continuing to keep our client service and retention at record levels. We recently released the newest version of our Applicant Tracking system, myStaffingPro, which has expanded mobility and new features designed to enhance the job candidate experience by reducing data entry, improving completion rates and providing ability to create candidate differentiators. This improved candidate experience helps our clients increase their applicant pools and can also utilize the enhanced tools to better screen their applicant. In summary, we had a solid quarter and made progress on many fronts including strong sales execution, service delivery, product development and deployment and financial performance. I appreciate the great work of our entire Paychex's team across the country. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer to review the financial results in more detail. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Marty and good morning to everyone. I\u2019d like to remind you what I customarily remind you that during today's conference call, we will make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risk, refer to the 10-Q for a full discussion of these risks. Before I get into the specifics of the quarter results. I'd just like to say that fourth quarter expectations for payroll and HRS revenue indicate that we'll meet the full year guidance that we've provided throughout the year, more on fiscal 2015 guidance later on. In addition we introduced our minimum premium plan health insurance offering for PEO clients and worksite employees in the third quarter of last year. We have just passed the anniversary of this new health insurance offering and we have seen strong acceptance by our PEO clients. Due to the self insurance provisions within the new offering, certain PEO direct costs are now classified as operating expenses rather than a reduction in service revenue. This change had no impact on operating income although it did have some impact on margin as those of you who have been looking at our results over the last three quarters understand. This new health insurance offering did not have a impact on our fiscal 2015 third quarter and nine month results. As Marty indicated, our third quarter financial results for fiscal 2015 represent continued progress building on the solid start we experienced through the first half of the year. Here are some of the key highlights I will provide detail in certain areas and then I\u2019m going to wrap with a review of our full year 2015 outlook. Total service revenue grew 8% for the third quarter to $694 million and 9%, $2 billion for the nine months. Interest on funds held for clients increased 2% for the third quarter and 3% for the nine months to $11 million and $31 million respectively. These fluctuations were driven by an increase in average investment balances. Expenses increased 10% for the third quarter and 11% for the nine months primarily in compensation related costs and the PEO direct costs that I mentioned previously. Driving a portion of this increase in PEO direct cost, the new health insurance offering accounted for approximately 3 percentage points of the growth in total expenses for the third quarter and 4 percentage points of the growth year-to-date. The plan has grown significantly in the number of worksite employees enrolled in the plan since it began a year ago. The increase in compensation related cost was driven by higher employee benefit related cost, together with higher sales headcount and performance based comp cost associated with the strong sales execution that Marty mentioned. We also continued to support investment and product development. Operating income net of certain items increased 6% for the third quarter and for the nine months grew to $254 million and $771 million respectively. We maintained strong operating margins and anticipate that our full year will remain within our guidance range, which I\u2019ll discuss shortly. Diluted earnings per share increased 5% to 46% per share for the third quarter and 8% to $1.41 per share for the nine months. Net income increased 6% to $169 million for the third quarter and 7% to $514 million for the nine months. Turning to payroll service revenue, it increased 2% for the third quarter and 4% for the nine months. We benefited from increases in revenue per check in client base. Revenue per check growth resulted from price increases net of discounting along with the impact of increased product penetration. Checks per payroll grew, but at a more moderate rate than we had projected. We expected payroll revenue results for the third quarter to moderate as we shared during the second quarter earnings call. As we indicated in last quarter's call, timing shifts between the quarters and lower checks per payroll drove the results. We expect a return to more normalized growth rate in the fourth quarter expected to be comparable to the first half of the year and full year guidance for payroll revenue remains unchanged. Turning to HRS, revenue increased 19% for both the third quarter and for the nine months. We experience strong growth in both clients and worksite employees at Paychex's HR services. The new minimum premium health insurance offering also contributed five percentage points of the growth in HRS revenue during the third quarter. Retirement services revenue benefited from pricing together with increases in the number of planned and average asset value of participant funds. Insurance services benefited from the ramp up of our new full service offering to comply with healthcare reform requirements, a moderate increase in the number of health and benefit applicants and higher premiums in our Workers Comp insurance product. Our online HR administrative services continue to experience growth in clients. Turning to our investment portfolio, our continued goal is to protect principle and optimize liquidity. We invest in high quality lower risk instruments primarily variable rate demand notes and bank demand deposits for short-term funds and municipal bonds for our longer term portfolio. Our longer term portfolio has an average yield of 1.6% and an average duration of 3.2 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 0.9% for the third quarter and 1% for the nine months consistent with same periods last year. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased during the third quarter and nine months, primarily driven by wage inflation together with growth in the client base. We are now on a gradual upswing from the impact of the client new rates that begin in 2008. Our average reinvestment yields are now meeting or slightly exceeding the weighted average yield on our longer term portfolio. As such we are not seeing a significant negative impact from turnover in the portfolio. The Fed has indicated that it is possible that they will raise rates later in the year, which could have a positive impact on our interest income earned on our client and corporate portfolios. We\u2019ll now walk you through highlights of our financial position; it remains strong with cash and total investments of approximately $1 billion as of the end of the quarter and no debt. Funds held for clients as of February 28, 2015 were $5.1 billion compared to $4.2 billion as of May 2014. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and average $4.4 billion for the quarter and $3.9 billion for the nine months. This reflects growth of 3% for both periods. Total stockholders' equity was $1.9 billion as of February 28, 2015, reflecting $414 million in dividends paid during the nine months and 1.7 million shares repurchased for approximately $70 million. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 36%. Cash flows from operations were $693 million for the first nine months, a slight decrease from the prior year. The change was the result of fluctuations in working capital partially offset by higher net income. The fluctuations in working capital between periods were primarily related to the timing of income tax payments, you look at the prepaid line on the cash flow statement you see the end collections from clients, payments for compensation PEO payroll. It\u2019s common for our working capital to fluctuate between quarters. Now let me turn to fiscal 2015 guidance and I\u2019ll keep it fairly short. I\u2019d like to remind you that our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant change and I\u2019ll just summarize it by saying our guidance has unchanged from what we provided at the beginning of the fiscal year. Before I turn things over to Marty, I want to let you know that Paychex will be hosting Investor Day in mid-July. We're working on a transportation friendly day, so you can get in and out on the same day, if you are on the East Coast or the Mid-West, sorry for those on the West Coast, get for you how to make that work. It\u2019s going to be scheduled for Wednesday, July 15 here in Rochester. We\u2019ll post a save the date message on our IR website and we will be providing registration information and other details in mid-April. We hope to see many of you in the summer. I'll turn it back to Marty. Martin Mucci : Thanks Efrain, we will now open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] That question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Togut : Thank you and good morning. Martin Mucci : Hi David. David Togut : Can you provide a little more detail on the underlying drivers behind the double-digit growth in new annualized revenue, as told during the peak selling season? In particular, breakdown between payroll service and HR services bookings? Martin Mucci : Well David we don\u2019t usually give that much detail on it but I will tell you that we were strong across the Board. I would say both payroll -- all areas of payroll as well as HRS, were both very strong and probably the best sales and we had a pretty good sales we had seen over the last year. But this is probably the best sales results in a selling season we\u2019ve seen in I would say seven or eight years. David Togut : What accounts for that? Martin Mucci : Well I think very good execution on the sales side. I also think that the channels that we\u2019ve been developing from our constant CPA channel has been continuing to be strong. The bank channel, we've picked up a lot from the bank channel from a referral standpoint. We\u2019ve also added a number of franchise arrangements for where the supported or the preferable company for payroll and I think we\u2019ve just done a good job overall also team selling. So going in is not just payroll and then coming back to sell the other ancillary services but going in right up front in selling the full value of all of the products to the client right up front. So we\u2019ve seen good growth in payroll. We\u2019ve seen good growth in HRS, in the Affordable Care Act products, our employers shared responsibility product has been strong and certainly HR outsourcing both PEO and ASO all have been strong. I think its execution. I think it\u2019s a lot of work that the Head of Sales, Mark Bottini, he has been doing with that team to build a good referral and pipeline as well. David Togut : With that rate of new annualized recurring revenue growth taken together with your current client retention trends, point to a change in your revenue growth rate for FY'16 and FY'17? Martin Mucci : Well, I can\u2019t really get into guidance, now I think we will have a better sense of that at the next quarter to talk about '16 but certainly bodes well for a start anyway. David Togut : Thank you very much. Martin Mucci : Okay. Thanks David. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from George Mihalos with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. George Mihalos : Hey guys thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to start off on the core payroll side, the growth of 2%. I guess I'm closer like 2.4%, the way we calculated. But, anything else to call out there aside from timing, meaning was there any sort of slippage maybe on the pricing side 2Q to 3Q or a bit of a slower rate of client growth, or anything else? Martin Mucci : Yes good question, so client growth no, pricing no, checks a little bit less than we expected. So little bit color on that. So we\u2019ve seen moderation in checks per payroll. We\u2019re not calling it out specifically because when it\u2019s trending around 1% it really is not a significant contributor to revenue overall. But what we did see was that checks have just been a little lighter, were a little bit lighter in the quarter than we anticipated. Now just two more points of detail on that, what's interesting about that number is again I ruled out client and I ruled out price, because that\u2019s not a driver here. Timing is primarily the reason, but secondarily what\u2019s going on is that even though we saw an increase in the amount of bonus dollars that we paid in checks, that\u2019s what we seem to be seeing in the data. We actually saw a slight decrease in the amount of bonus checks. So it looks like people were being paid a little bit more in bonuses, but the size of those bonuses resulted in lower checks. So it was a little bit lighter and that really kind of drove much of the difference in payroll service revenue. We\u2019ve accounted for that as we look forward. I think we\u2019re just in this environment now where with check per client or check per payroll growth is going to be moderate going forward. So that's some color on that point. George Mihalos : Okay. Appreciate that commentary. And then just my second question, on the prior earnings call, I think you guys talked a little bit about M&A and your appetite to do something there. Just curious what you're seeing out there in the marketplace and if you still have an appetite for, I guess what you would consider a large scale acquisition in addition to any tuck-ins? Martin Mucci : Yes we do, I think there is -- we still a see a lot available, we\u2019re looking at more than we probably ever have in the past, everything is pretty highly valued. So we\u2019re going to be very selective as to what we do, but we\u2019re looking at both something that would be product tuck-ins, but also just add to the base because we think whether it\u2019s PEO, payroll or other services, we think we\u2019re pretty effective at what we're -- how we're executing and it\u2019s a good time to acquire. May not find something, but we are pretty deep into number of things we\u2019re looking at the time, and size would be -- we would be very selective, but we certainly have the cash to do it if that makes sense. George Mihalos : And just to be clear, you\u2019re going to be sticking to your sort of a payroll acquisition or something in that area or in HRS services, you\u2019re not going to any sort of other areas? Martin Mucci : Yes that\u2019s correct. George Mihalos : Okay. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Your line is open. Martin Mucci : Hi Jason. Ryan Cary : Hi guys this is Ryan Cary calling in for Jason. I just want to build on George's question. Although you reiterated the full-year guide of 3% to 5% for the payroll services, has your outlook on where you might fall in that range changed at all after this quarter meaning, do expect 4Q to make up for any of the moderate softness or a little bit below that range we saw in 3Q? Martin Mucci : When we issue guidance, we expect to be somewhere around the middle for the year. I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now. Ryan Cary : Okay. Great. And do you see any material changes in the competitive environment as you got deeper into the peak calendar year-end selling season and I have to ask a question on pricing as well. Last quarter you seemed comfortable pricing would stay in that say 2% to 4% band. Has that been any material change in either direction over the last quarter? I would love any additional color. Thanks so much. Martin Mucci : Yes. I don\u2019t think so. We didn\u2019t literally see because actually we felt very good about the quarter from a selling perspective. I would say the competitive environment was about the same, didn\u2019t see any extra pricing pressure. There is always competitive pricing pressure out there, but we didn\u2019t see anything pick up necessarily there was no big competitor plans or things that they were doing that we saw that made any big difference there. So I would say pricing is generally holding like we thought it was last quarter and competitive environment about the same. Ryan Cary : Great, thanks so much. Martin Mucci : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Sara Gubins -- on behalf of Sara Gubins, your line is open. David Ridley Lane : Sure so Efrain, you mentioned that some payroll service revenue was being deferred from third quarter into fourth quarter. Now that you're through this third quarter, could you give us a sense of magnitude of that, and this is David Ridley Lane for Sara Gubins. Efrain Rivera : I thought it was you David, David I think it\u2019s implicit in what I said that we expect to be somewhere in the middle of the range if you heard my comments earlier, I said that that fourth quarter was comparable to the first half of the year and a kind of I will leave it at that. David Ridley Lane : Okay and then could we get an update on the sensitivity of the portfolio to the first 25 or 50 basis points interest rate increase? Efrain Rivera : Yes on the short term, it\u2019s going to be about $4 million somewhere in the range to little bit less, little bit more. And that just assume the short term prices. What that does to a long-term rage is a good question. I don\u2019t have a crystal ball on that and timing at this point, our best estimate is Q2, but again our crystal ball has been exceedingly fuzzy. David Ridley Lane : Got it, thank you very much. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Smitti with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Smitti Srethapramote : Thank you. I just had a couple of follow-up questions on the minimum premium plan, maybe you can talk about how the claims have trended versus your expectations and whether you\u2019ve got in any closer to rolling out this offering to more states? Martin Mucci : Yes, so I would say that claims experience thus far has been about what we expected. We\u2019re pretty conservative in terms of our approach and takes kind of belt and suspenders view from an actuarial perspective. We have two actuaries look at it and have pretty extensive conversations about how we set prices. I think one thing that I just like to reiterate from our perspective the PEO is not a insurance play. It\u2019s an HR outsourcing play. So we understand the payrolls of selling cheap insurance in the PEO and it\u2019s not a direction we want to go in. So I think claims have trended about where we expected them to be. I didn\u2019t get -- I forgot the second half of your question, Smitti. Smitti Srethapramote : Just can you give us an update in terms of your plans to roll out the offering to more states? Martin Mucci : Yes, at this point, we\u2019re still getting through kind of a full year of this one. We feel very good about it. As Efrain said, I think we\u2019ve done very well on the claims and so forth, but it\u2019s a year into it and we don\u2019t have immediate plans to expand it outside of the area but that is where a big amount of our sales are. So I think we'll give it a more experience before we look to expand it. Smitti Srethapramote : And just falling along on the minimum plan, can you talk about how the client ramped has look like over the past year and whether you switch clients over or whether it\u2019s really new clients signing up for the product? Martin Mucci : It\u2019s primarily new clients that we\u2019re signing up. When we initially did it, we obviously moved existing clients on to the plan, now what we're doing is we're selling new clients. I would say PEO client base is growing nicely double-digit. So I would -- one thing I hope we\u2019re not leaving the impression that it's the minimum premium plan driving PEO growth, it really is that there is a lot of interest in the market now for bundled HR outsourcing solutions plus that would also include healthcare and that\u2019s driving the market. Smitti Srethapramote : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Good. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair. Your line is open. Tim McHugh : Yes. Can you help us contrast the double-digit growth in annualized new sales? I guess what was that growth number a year or two ago? How much of an improvement is that versus what you've seen in the last couple of years? Martin Mucci : Well, I would say it's certainly gone from single-digit fairly flat actually to single-digit to now double-digit in par annualized revenue and so this is as I said, I think this is probably the best selling season we've seen in seven or eight years. So I think every good execution. I think it's much stronger than last year, which was pretty good and as I said its very much across the Broad. So it's not just PEO in the HRS services. It's a good team selling. We're seeing good payroll and HR outsourcing 401(k) really across the Board. I think this is very good execution and I do think obviously the market is coming back a little bit from a small business in mid size business environment. So I would say how I characterize them is best in seven or eight years from an increased standpoint from a total par standpoint. Tim McHugh : But last year it was improved, but you did have a still kind of mid single digits last year even. Efrain Rivera : It was in single digits. I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as mid single digits. Tim McHugh : Okay. And does it change your thoughts on. I think you've talked about trying to get unit growth or client growth back up to kind of somewhere in the 1% to 3% range. What are your thoughts on that as you I guess exit this selling season based on what you saw? Martin Mucci : Well it's still a combination. We want the units and the revenue both and that\u2019s the way our comp plans and our incentives are set. So we're still looking for both and we're still trying to -- we certainly expect to be in that range from client growth perspective. Tim McHugh : But you want to be I guess I was trying to see if you would increase that range given the sale season or if it's in other words I guess if you still would say 1% to 3%. Martin Mucci : Yes, I would still -- no I would stay in that range from client growth perspective. I think this is an ability to sell higher revenue per client. As much as product it is selling more complete bundles to clients and more complete and more ancillary services as well. So I think client growth would still be in that same range. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily bring that up, but I think we are selling more revenue per client because of the better execution the team selling etcetera. Tim McHugh : Okay great. Martin Mucci : Thanks Tim. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Hi Efrain, hi Marty. Efrain, you talked a little bit about the float. Are we at a point, now, if we assume that rates stay kind of where they are and don't worry about increases, that float income year-over-year should be flat and if rates go up you could start seeing an increase there? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I think you should see it tick up modestly. Yes, I think that\u2019s where we are at. We've kind of -- we've weathered the storm and the storm appears to have passed. Hopefully we're not in the eye of something, but its seems to be that the worst certainly has passed and from the perspective of the portfolio and how we will manage it interest rates now just represent upside as I like to say the embedded optionality of the stock. Kartik Mehta : And Marty, you talked a little bit about price increases and this quarter we haven't seen, really, any increased competition. As you look at the next price increase, which I think you usually do sometime in the May timeframe, anything change in the environment which would change your mind as to the type of price increase you would do this fiscal year compared to what you were able to do the current fiscal year? Martin Mucci : No I think we would still be in that same range. I think we got more sophisticated as to kind of where we put the price increase based on clients, products and the competitive nature of those products with the portfolio of different products we have, but I still think you would expect us to be in that -- you should expect us to be in that 2% to 4% range. Kartik Mehta : And then just one last question. Efrain, you alluded to this a little bit when you were talking about the PEO and I'm wondering, is there a way to quantify any ATA benefits you're getting? And, if that benefit goes away next year? Or, is the PEO at least the way you look at it and the HRS business, the trends are fairly strong, so we should continue to see the growth you've been witnessing? Efrain Rivera : My initial answer to that is that I would expect a continuation of trends, having said that we are going through the planning process and having our usual discussion with sales about what we think is attainable. I think we are -- its fair to say we're in a favorable environment. How we set that for next year\u2019s plan still remains to be decided. Kartik Mehta : Thank you very much. Efrain Rivera : You are welcome. Operator : And the next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC. Your line is open. Martin Mucci : Hi Gary. Gary Bisbee : Hi. Good morning. Just going back to the minimum premium plan for one more question. Can you give us a sense, is that growing much more quickly than other PEO? And I guess now that we've annualized you adding that, I'm trying to think, will that be growing faster and thus be somewhat of a drag on margins even though there's a little profit impact for several more quarters? Or, is most of that behind you now that you've got the introduction of that? Martin Mucci : I think the next quarter is when it will pretty much anniversary Gary. So we will see a little bit a drag into next quarter and then starting the following quarter it should be a more fair compare, but the point you are making is a fair one to the extent that more PEO clients attach healthcare. It does have a slight drag on margins, simply because we don\u2019t get much a margin flow through. But, after fourth quarter it shouldn\u2019t be significant. Gary Bisbee : Okay great. And then I think we all know PEO -- because of the pass through, somewhat lower margin, but when you look at the mix of new business and just the composition of your growth in the last year or two and going forward, how do we think about the puts and takes around margins? Is stuff -- a lot of stuff coming in at a lower margin? Or, some of it is incrementally more profitable to existing customers? What are the main issues? Martin Mucci : Yes. So Gary. That\u2019s a good question. The answer is if you look at most of HRS with the exception of PEO, if I take all of those products, they're all growing pretty strongly and they all have margins that are comparable to payroll. One exception to that is insurance, but it's still too small to exert an overall drag on margin. So the answer is we shouldn\u2019t see significant delusion there. There may be a moderate impact if PEO really, really starts to grow much faster than everything else. It's been growing nicely but it's part of the mix and its reflected in our results. So unless that really took off, it shouldn\u2019t have a significant impact on overall margins. Gary Bisbee : Great and then just one last one, last time the company got north of $1 billion of net cash in corporate investments there was a sizable buyback. I think it seems like you've been more likely to do some steady buybacks over time rather than the one big. I wondered if you've given any thought to maybe a special dividend or some other way of returning more quickly a portion of that excess cash. Martin Mucci : So we -- I guess my normal answer to that is that when its above a $1 billion, we have to think about what we do with it and it's a function of where we are with respect to opportunities within the M&A portfolio. So to the extent we don\u2019t see those materializing in a shorter term timeframe than we have to have that conversation with the Board and they're ultimately going to decide what make sense but we will be having those conversations. Gary Bisbee : Great thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jim MacDonald with First Analysis. Your line is open. Jim MacDonald : Good morning, guys. On the double digit new bookings growth do you think we will see that more in HR or in somewhat in payroll or how is that going to play out? Martin Mucci : I think both of them are pretty strong. But I think it's a little stronger in the HR side. I think that\u2019s obviously where we have more opportunity to sell the ancillary, the wide breath of ancillary products that we have. So a little bit stronger on the HR side particularly as Efrain said between PEO, ASO, 401(k) our online service, time and attendance kind of everything, but payroll is in there. So I think it's certainly been a little stronger on the HR side, but both of them are good. Efrain Rivera : And I would say on this that Marty mentioned it was double digit, it was in the third quarter it was in double digit in payroll. So to Marty\u2019s point we were pretty strong across the Board. Jim MacDonald : Great. And this I think is similar to other questions, but as people continue to adopt the minimum premium plan, will you continue to get a little bit of a tailwind in revenue growth that you sort of had this year from new revenue recognition? Martin Mucci : That's a good question. You really don\u2019t see as much of it next year. We really obviously got a -- two things. We obviously got an uplift this year. We've been careful to call it out because we don\u2019t want people to misunderstand what\u2019s going on in the underlying numbers and most people understand it. We were within $3 million of what the street had on revenue. So everyone understands kind of what\u2019s going on. You get a modest tick up, but after this year you would -- the impact is not significant. Jim MacDonald : Okay. And just one sort of on the repurchase your share count kind of started to drift back up again, any thoughts on that? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I wish the share count didn\u2019t drift up, but we will -- I would say we will repurchase opportunistically. I think that's where we're at right now before I think Gary\u2019s question earlier on would we do something more? We'll have to take a look at where we are with M&A and address whether we think something larger is warranted. Jim MacDonald : Great thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Martin Mucci : Hi Bryan. Evan Bull : Hi guys. This is Evan Bull on for Brian. Just real quick on the bookings growth in the December and January quarters, maybe directionally, was that ahead of your expectations, below or right at? Just given the magnitude of those months? Martin Mucci : I think it was pretty close to our expectations. We set pretty high goals for the sales team and what we expected in particularly in selling season. I would say it was pretty much at our expectations because we set pretty high ones. Evan Bull : Sure, that helps. And then you guys have introduced a number of SaaS-based products over the course of the past year. Can you talk about the traction with those products and maybe the competition and kind of the competitive dynamic there? Aside from ADP who else are the players that you're competing with directly? Martin Mucci : Yes I always say the name competitors because it just gives them creditability. I think ADP is the one we run into the most. There is a couple of other that have recently gone through IPOs as you run into but we're winning some of those clients back actually right now over service issues and so forth. So I think from a product standpoint we stand up very competitively and all SaaS, the ability of the SaaS products in the bundling of these integration is so critical to us and we're continuing you will see over the next six months to really even more fully integrate a lot kind of I think they're best-in-class products. So we have myStaffingPro for example which is sold and integrated but it will see even better integration this year as well as stratus time, which is I think the leading time in attendance SaaS offering that we purchased last June and now you will see it not only as it integrated now, but it will grow much of a full integration. So we compete very we'll. It's still primarily with ADP and then there is some of the pays that we call in that you'll see, but again we're starting to win those back. They're pretty small losses for them at this stage. Evan Bull : Thanks, that helps guys. Martin Mucci : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from SK Prasad from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. SK Prasad : Thanks for taking my question. First one is probably just on the timing impact. You guys talk about double digit growth you're seeing in bookings. How long does it take to actually see that from a revenue side? Martin Mucci : You start to see that probably a couple of quarters out. That\u2019s when -- so you know the first quarter is not much depending on where it occurred. You start to get the client set up. There is a little bit of time and then probably after the second quarter that\u2019s when you're starting to see the impact. SK Prasad : Okay. That's clear. Probably if you could provide some color on some of the newer products, which you guys have launched over the last few quarters. PEO, I understand it's at a lower margin profile than the Group level, but just thinking about this newer products are there any products or so is this, which are at higher margin than the Group level? Martin Mucci : I would say as Efrain mentioned earlier most of the products are at a pretty strong margin level across the Board. I think insurance Efrain mentioned was pretty strong margin, but that\u2019s still a small part of the business although the health insurance in particular Workers Comp has always been pretty strong. The health insurance is really starting to pick up now and that's in addition to the Affordable Care Act products that we have. I think ours is a business we work very hard to make sure we have the strongest margins possible obviously with our high margins in the industry now and we keep trying to drive those. But I think when you look at the newer products that we either purchased or built set us time from a time and attendance, SaaS product, myStaffingPro from a recruitment and applicant tracking product, BeneTrac, the benefit enrollment all of those have -- will have pretty good margins particularly as we build scale and more fully integrate them into the bundles. So all those products are doing well and they\u2019re getting out of the gate and this is even before we more fully integrate them into the Paychex flex our SaaS kind of the SaaS based for the whole thing. SK Prasad : And probably just last one regarding float income yes there are some positive comments coming from Fed and you might end up seeing some positive impact from that, but just from a long-term strategy around your portfolio, would you be open to concerning options like small business lending given your strong distribution strength and strong customer base? Martin Mucci : The answer your question SK we have that discussion probably I would say once a quarter. The challenge we see there, so we\u2019re looking at ways to partner, we do partner with Biz2credit on small business loans and referral arrangement. We\u2019re just very cautious about tiptoeing into an area that could be highly regulated. So that's why we've been cautious about doing it. It\u2019s an area of interest if we could participate a little bit more fully we would look at it but that's the inhibitor. SK Prasad : Okay. Thank you. Thanks Martin. Martin Mucci : Thanks. Operator : Thank you, the next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much. Efrain, not to nitpick here but in looking at the supplemental schedule, if you look at the operating margin guidance for the fourth quarter, 35% to 36%, I think last quarter that number was 36% to 37%. Is there something going on that we should be aware? Efrain Rivera : Yes, I think Jeff, so we're first of all eagle eyes there. I did not call it out except that in my comment what you saw were some discussion about higher cost in the quarter and the higher costs were driven primarily by sales related expense. And so we're just simply calling out that we think given strong sales performance now we're moderating a little bit the margin given the strong sales performance in the back half of the year that's what's driving that modest change. Jeff Silber : All right. That makes sense and I wish I could take credit for it, but somebody pointed out it to me. Just one other question you mentioned on the checks per payroll and I know it\u2019s not as big of an issue as it was before and you expect more normalized growth in the fourth quarter? Efrain Rivera : Correct. Jeff Silber : Is that because of the bonus issue you mentioned that shouldn\u2019t really impact the quarter? Efrain Rivera : Yes so it\u2019s not going to impact the quarter and I think the timing shifts that I discussed in Q2 these happen from time to time. I\u2019m sorry that I mentioned in Q3 that doesn\u2019t occur in Q4 and then we're back at a more normalized rate like what you saw in the first half of the year. Jeff Silber : All right great, thanks so much. Efrain Rivera : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Your line is open. David Grossman : Thank you good morning. Efrain Rivera : Good morning. David Grossman : I was wondering if you would just step back to the cost in HRS and perhaps help us better understand ASO versus the PEO on what the trends are you are seeing in the buyers of each of those different products? Martin Mucci : Yes I think primarily the PEO has typically been in States where they're just more comfortable and more used to PEOs, but I think what's expanded a little bit from a PEO side David is because of the Affordable Care Act they\u2019re looking more to kind of feel more comfortable, kind of within a co- employer relationship. So there is a little bit more acceptance I think to the PEO in that just the typical states of Florida, Texas et cetera type of states. So we do see that growing and I think that has been frankly a lot of the Affordable Care Act has pushed more people into seeing the opportunity and just feeling more comfortable being part of shared kind of employment service. And those who don\u2019t need to go there probably have the ASO and both I think the ASO is still coming primarily at it from an HR outsourcing type of business. We\u2019ve seen that drop down so where clients didn\u2019t think about HR outsourcing at 30 employees or 20 employees now do because of the complexity of the regulations of the hiring and firing and other compliance issues. So both are growing, I think PEO still tends to grow a little bit more from thinking -- starting to think about the insurance but then realizing that the HR support is there and that\u2019s why they buy totally. Because that's really how we sell it is the value of HR support, but the ASO continues to be HR and I just think it\u2019s still complex now, the Affordable Care Act there is number of immigration reform issues that are out there for hiring and so forth. All of these things add more people to say hey I want to be, I want to outsource my HR to somebody who is going to stay current and of course we have been a leader in this business that we have more client employees than anybody else in the business by far that we service and in over 400 individuals around the country who has serviced the clients face to face. And I think that has made for great growth. Efrain Rivera : And to build on that David I think that when you look at how we are going to market and how we sell that product. ASO tends to be as Marty mentioned tends to be a little bit lower typically work site employees and within the base, PEO tends to be a little bit bigger and a combination of inside the base and outside the base. So our PEO sales are not just existing Paychex\u2019s clients but also outside the base. David Grossman : And is the relative growth rate -- just without getting into the specific numbers -- are they comparable? If not, do you expect them to diverge at all over the next couple of years? Efrain Rivera : I think they're generally comparable, yes they are pretty close on both side just a preference for what probably the clients thinks. I think the other thing that we probably didn\u2019t mention is selling this more upfront, we have found that typically our model was sell them payroll and come back and say do you need HR services in three months or six months. And we are selling much more upfront, if we think the client is of a 20 plus in a complexity, we were going in team sell and I think we are winning more clients were in upfront and ASO or PEO basis. David Grossman : Okay. And just one other question. Do you sell the ancillary services without payroll? And if you don't, have you ever considered doing that? Martin Mucci : Good question, so the answer is yes, we do, although for example we reported I believe last year 580,000 clients. We think we had in excess of 20,000 clients that don\u2019t take payroll but take other ancillary products. And I think David it points to the fact that the company that we were prior to the recession in very different from the company that we emerged out of the recession. We are much more of an integrated full service provider to small and medium sized businesses. And you are starting to see that in the client base and we will update some of that information when we get to the end of the year. David Grossman : That\u2019s very good. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Welcome. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird. Your line is open. Efrain Rivera : Hi Mark. Mark Marcon : Hi Marty, hi Efrain. Good morning. With regards to the core payroll growth that you've seen, can you characterize where you're seeing the strongest growth in terms of, is it the smallest end of your other client size? Or, just the average small client and what are you seeing on the MMS side? Efrain Rivera : I would say on the average, it is on the average, don\u2019t necessarily the smallest clients, although new business formation has picked up some obviously and kind of getting back to where we were pre-recession levels. And I think in our sales to new businesses are back up over last year this year and so I think there is some small but I think primarily it\u2019s net average based if not slightly higher I would say meaning one or two employees or something like that. So I think we\u2019re right in the average and in the mid market I think it is about the same, I think we focused very heavily on the 50 to 500 in that mid market space and I think that has been a sweet spot for us. We certainly have clients that are above that. But we are really focusing the team on that 50 to 500, it is a very hard space right now for multiple products, those are the clients that need multiple products that are integrated in SaaS space and we fit really well there. Mark Marcon : So you are seeing the same level of growth in that 50 to 500 as in that sub-20 group? Efrain Rivera : Yes I would say we are pretty close I would say yes. Mark Marcon : Great and you still have some improvements to make to that 50 to 500 product set right? Efrain Rivera : Well I think what I mentioned earlier is over the next six months you will see even stronger integration. So all on the kind of the same user interface and so forth. So they're integrated today from a different levels, but over the next six months Stratustime that we acquired last year myStaffingPro and BeneTrac will see even enhanced integration\u2026 Mark Marcon : Single sign-on, single database? Efrain Rivera : Yes, good. And Mark just I\u2019m sorry go ahead\u2026 Martin Mucci : Just -- which will make that even a stronger product right from applicant tracking right through to retirement as they say, but particularly on the frontend of the applicant tracking and the benefit enrollment. Efrain Rivera : Building on what Marty said, the way we segment markets mark is under 50 and 50 to 500. We look at it from a unit basis the growth is pretty comparable. Mark Marcon : Okay. Great and with regards to the sales that you\u2019ve seen can you characterize the number of add-on modules that you\u2019re seeing now relative to say a year ago? Efrain Rivera : I guess I would say this is what you mean. We saw a lot more bundled services\u2026 Mark Marcon : Right. Efrain Rivera : Certainly than standalone payroll, that has gone up dramatically over the last four years. Mark Marcon : What does dramatically mean? Efrain Rivera : I would say from low double-digits is a percent to mid almost, okay double-digit kind of. If you think double hundred, so we used to sell probably standalone payroll, this is the change in the wholesale theme probably 10% to 20% of bundled services right up front, 10% to 20% of the time now we are selling a complete bundle probably 40% to 50% of the time. It is pretty dramatic. Mark Marcon : That's great. Efrain Rivera : That's the way we bundled the products as well and the way that sales has looked to increase the revenue per client and really to sell the client everything they need right upfront is part of a bundle. Mark Marcon : Great and then what percentage of your sales are now coming from brand new businesses? Efrain Rivera : I would say it is still close to half. It is still close to that 50%. Mark Marcon : But that is picking up? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Mark Marcon : Okay. Great and then if the economy stays as it is would you expect your new business revenue growth target to basically stay about the same? Efrain Rivera : I think so. Martin Mucci : Yes Mark I think it is really been typically between about 45, then low 50s, 52, 53, it is hard to envision that that changes that much. I mean part of what distinguishes us from a lot of companies is that we are remaining that new base to get our customers. So we get the 3% payroll they have eventually became an 8%, 10%, 20% payroll. Because we mind that, so that is part of the way we sell how we do that, how we go to market over time may change, but that's really core to how we're approaching the market. Mark Marcon : Okay. And then lastly this is completely separate from new business formations in terms of a question but is specific to your bookings growth, when we take a look at the target that was set and if the environment stays the same, in terms of how you are judged, do you think that your target will roughly stay the same as what we have recently seen in certain documents? Martin Mucci : So that is a very wonderfully elliptical euphemistic way of saying, we typically have a pretty tough target. Management doesn\u2019t get paid. We don\u2019t start to having conversations until we are getting close to double-digits. So we will expect that we will have a double-digit target and we will expect it if we don\u2019t need it, we will suffer the consequences. So that is kind of where we are at from management\u2019s comp perspective obviously sales don't set of comp. Mark Marcon : Well congratulations on a good year, this year. Martin Mucci : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from John Williams with Topeka Capital Markets. Mr. Williams your line is open. Martin Mucci : Hi John. John Williams : Good morning guys, thanks for taking my questions first. So you had mentioned in the release a couple of things that I thought were interesting and maybe speak to, what's happening in the wider world, specifically regarding number one pricing and number two just the fact that you are starting to see wages move up a little bit. I was wondering if there is any read that you have perhaps more on the wage side than on the pricing side you have talked a bit about the pricing side but curious to know what you're seeing on a wider scale with wage inflation and if that's something you think is become an issue in the next few months? Martin Mucci : I think wages, we've generally seen around 2%. So I wouldn\u2019t say it's anything overly strong, I think we saw Efrain I think mentioned earlier from a bonus perspective, which we watch, bonuses were higher. It weren\u2019t -- didn't seem to be as many necessarily or bunch of an increases we thought, but they were higher, but general wage has been only has been pretty consistent at around 2% increase. Efrain Rivera : Yeah, I think you're picking up John on the 3% client fund balances and so that incorporates not only wages, but anything else that we're paying. So it looks like it's ticking up moderately. John Williams : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you, guys. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Your line is open. Martin Mucci : Hi Lisa. Lisa Ellis : Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my call. Can you comment, just following up, on the strong bookings and then also, increase in sales expense? Can you just give a little bit more color around sales productivity and how that's trending compared to, say, growth in the sales force? Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think we're showing obviously good productivity in this third quarter and the selling season from a standpoint of revenue per reps. So we\u2019re seeing pretty productivity there kind as we projected or set our goals I guess I\u2019d say. And so that always drives when you tie it back to expense in the third quarter because we have a lot of sales in the third quarter when January starts for payroll in particular that drives the sales expense up. But I would say sales expense kind of per sale is generally consistent with where we thought it would be and we\u2019re continuing to get productivity out of the sales team I think they\u2019re executing very well as you look over last few years in particular. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. And then second one, on the ASO and PEO businesses, how much of the growth there is coming from Greenfield versus how many of those deals are you think that it's competitive or actually a takeout? Martin Mucci : I would say in the PEO side, I think it's probably 60, 40 I seeing that number lately, but I would say more new, just when you think about it trends tended to be with our overall business. So we're 50% new businesses. I think if that\u2019s what you are asking from a payroll standpoint. I think the PEO is similar to that may be a little bit more on the new side but I think it's right in the range of 50-50. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Okay. And then last one, just a longer-term question. In your comments up front, you talked a bit about flex and the health care reform offering in myStaffingPro and then made some comments in response to question about looking more actively at M&A. Can you just take a step back and give us an idea of looking out two, three, four years, how you envision the product portfolio evolving? Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think when you look out, it will be fully integrated software as a service offering meaning single database UI, very client friendly, mobility will be tied into it very directly. One of the things we didn\u2019t really comment on today just quickly in the comments is mobility, our mobile app has been continually -- we\u2019ve added to the mobile app and it has seen, pretty dramatic usage being picked up even more from client employees than clients and so we\u2019re seeing a nice kind roll up of client employees, which we think will add to retention by the way, which will because the client employees now will be interfacing with our products and will get -- we\u2019ve very positive feedback on the mobility. When you look out, it's going to be that single source for our client to come to us for everything from higher to retire as they do now and I think it will just be a very full product set. I think the M&A piece of it is some product tuck-ins were needed, but to be straightforward we\u2019ve got pretty much the products that we need. Now it\u2019s finishing the full integration of a single database within this year and then it will be adding, I think where we can execute and add more ability and make the company more efficient. So PEO\u2019s payroll companies probably 401-K is always out there in any off shoot of anything from recruiting etcetera those kind of businesses. So it\u2019s a pretty wide scope that we look at from an M&A perspective, but our job will be to drive upper single digit revenue growth on the topline and still be one of the most profitable companies in the business. Lisa Ellis : Terrific, thanks guys. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from the Joe Foresi at Janney. Your line is open. Robert Simmons : Hey, guys this is Robert Simmons on for Joe. Thanks for taking the question. Martin Mucci : Sure. Robert Simmons : Actually just had my first question, but what are your thoughts on international expansion? Martin Mucci : I\u2019ve been in Germany now for nine or ten years. We doubled our size last year within acquisition and continued sales growth. So we\u2019ve got a nice base there. Brazil we started last year and were kind of chugging along. It didn\u2019t help the kind of Brazil, economy kind of slowed down at a time that we were starting up there, but were kind of learning there and were breaking into the business of winning over the CPA so that they will refer more of their payroll business out to us. We're still very interested in it. We were going to focus on two or three countries kind of the third country we haven\u2019t quite found a good entry way in yet. We\u2019ve looked at number of them. We -- it will always I think at this point it tends to be small, it's kind of tend to be small part of where we are as we approach $3 billion in revenue, but it's still of interest to it and we continue to look at acquisition opportunities and ways to increase sales and profit there. Robert Simmons : Great, thanks guys. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matt O\u2019Neill with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Matt O\u2019Neill: Yes, hi good morning guys. Thanks for squeezing me in at the end. I was just hoping you could give us any updates you might be willing to provide on the short payroll business, specifically, and possibly if you could parse the client growth rate of 1% to 3% and the contribution from the SaaS side? Thanks. Martin Mucci : Yeah, sure. We don\u2019t really well in SaaS most of our products now are or most of our clients are on SaaS. So, well over 80% of them. From a growth standpoint, we don\u2019t breakout share payroll anymore, but they\u2019re doing fine. Really they've had good client growth year-over-year and I think they\u2019re competing very effectively with particularly the micro businesses for payroll. All of that is done through web marketing and in sales on the phone. Once people call in, I think they've been very effective at that in growing their client base and we continue to be pleased with that and continue to always watch who we are competing against. Not a lot of new competitors there. There some startups got up some quite a bit of press for a while but then it's kind of dropped out a little bit because they're not as a full product and ensure and so I think primarily it's into it that we run into as a competitor there and folks just wanting to stay manual do at a payroll manual. Efrain Rivera : And the other thing I would add is, you surf the web, there is a bunch of these different ratings services, but they just won a recent award in terms of user access and appearance and so they're very, very formidable competitor in platform in that micro enterprise space. Matt O\u2019Neill: Thanks very much. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is open. Martin Mucci : Hi, Ashwin. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Hey guys. So good job on the bookings, the run rate there. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Ashwin Shirvaikar : I guess my question is, as the bookings roll into revenues, can you talk about -- are there incremental expenses involved and then sticking to that question longer term, just longer term expense growth assumptions, where you're making investments in. Martin Mucci : Yeah, hey Ashwin so two things. In a quarter when we have particularly strong sales execution and our expenses tend to ramp up, so we had probably a little bit higher expense growth in the quarter and then in the back half of the year based on the performance we're seeing. Hopefully obviously that leads to little bit better build revenue going forward. But I don\u2019t think its unless we set our plans too low and they constantly beat them that\u2019s not the way we tend to do. We tend to set them pretty high and the sales force has a done a great job of rising to the challenge. With respect to expense, where we -- I think there is really going to be no change in terms of the approach we take. We\u2019re going to leverage operating expenses as much as we can. We're going to continued to invest in IT, probably at a little bit more of a moderate rate than you\u2019ve seen in past years or then has been embedded in the SG&A number, which is where it appears. And then we\u2019re going to continued to make selective investments in sales, where we think there is opportunities to grow the business. So I think that that will not change dramatically. Quarter-over-quarter you might have some changes as results are higher than where we expected. Ashwin Shirvaikar : So, the incremental IT investments is that just part of ongoing transition as you move towards more product related, more cloud basis and\u2026 Martin Mucci : As you know, our double-digit increases in IT investment for many years and I think what we\u2019re saying, it tends to flatten and we\u2019ve reached at a very good point of the amount of productivity, we\u2019re getting and the development needs and that's still a very -- it\u2019s become a very large part of our investment as you would expect with a SaaS based company that\u2019s very much technology driven service. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Last question, if you can have bit sort of the relative sizing of various HRS offerings ballpark? Martin Mucci : So the biggest now certainly is as I say is HR outsourcing both ASO, PEO and what we call our HR essentials product which is more a telephonic support HR light, HR outsourcing light. The second is our retirement services business and then third insurance nothings change there. Those are all businesses that are growing nicely and performing well within the portfolio. Ashwin Shirvaikar : I was hoping you can put numbers to that, but okay may be you\u2019ll at your investment. Efrain Rivera : Biggest followed by the next biggest followed by the smallest. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Okay, thank you guys. Efrain Rivera : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions in queue. Martin Mucci : Alright, thank you. At this we will close the call. If you\u2019re interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived until approximately April 25. We thank you for your interest in Paychex and for your participation on the call. Have a good day. Operator : That concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time. Once again that concludes today's conference. All lines may disconnect at this time.",

Welcome and thank you for standing by and welcome to today\u2019s conference call. At this time all lines are on listen-only for today's conference until the question-and-answer portion of our call. [Operator Instructions]. Our conference is being recorded and if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn our conference over to our host, Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Sir you may proceed. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex's Fiscal 2015 Year End Performance. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2015. We expect to file our Form 10-K by the end of July. The earnings press release is available by accessing our Investor Relations page at paychex.com. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about one month.  On today's call I will review the highlights of the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015, and our operations, sales and product development areas. Efrain will review our fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 financial results and discuss our fiscal 2016 guidance and then we'll open it up for your questions.  We are pleased, very pleased with our solid financial performance during 2015. Our results met the guidance that we have been providing throughout the year. We also achieved two key milestones this year. Both our human resource services revenue and our operating income exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our Paychex\u2019s history. Efrain will talk about our financial results in more detail. However, I'd like to provide you with some highlights. Payroll service revenue continued to experience steady growth of 4%, driven by increases in revenue per check and client base. HRS revenue for fiscal 2015 benefited from strong demand for our comprehensive human resource outsourcing solutions, both PEO and ASO, which drove double digit growth.  Our payroll client base finished the year at approximately 590,000 clients, an increase of about 2% from the prior year. We achieved good sales and retention results for our 401(k) product, and once again, we were recognized by Plansponsor magazine as the largest 401(k) record keeper by number of plans for the fifth consecutive year.  Sales execution during \u201815 was strong, with significant growth in our new annualized revenue sold. We did a great job with our team\u2019s selling approach, which sells the full value of all products to the client upfront. In addition, our referral pipeline is strong. We have had success in adding new bank and franchise referral arrangements and increasing our web leads in addition to our strong CPA referral channel. Client service is imperative for our success and we again excelled in fiscal 2015. This service is delivered through a combination of innovative technology, driven by SaaS solutions, accessed online through our mobile app and through the support of our dedicated service specialists that sets us apart from our competitors. The value of our solutions and service team, including our 7/24 support resulted in consistently high satisfaction scores and our best year ever in client retention, in excess of 82% of our beginning client base.  We continue to invest in our SaaS solutions and mobility offerings that position us for long-term growth. We are experiencing increased demand for our SaaS solutions across our client base. This includes Paychex Flex, which offers powerful workforce management capabilities in a simple and streamlined user experience. Paychex Flex couples this with the flexibility of choice for our client service needs, and this approach gives our clients access to a variety of customer service options based on their size and complexity. Our mobility app also continues to see a fast growing number of users, both clients and client employees. On Monday, we announced our Paychex Flex hiring offering which gives clients a simplified recruiting process with automated job opening, positing, and administration as well as an ability to onboard new clients in a paperless electronic environment, collecting all new information electronically and populating the data into the employee record fully integrated with our Flex offering. This continues to enhance the powerful human capital management solution that Flex brings to our clients.  We are also pleased with the market acceptance we are seeing for our new full service product that helps clients in navigating the complexities of healthcare reform. We have the ability to leverage our payroll data and our relationships with nationally recognized insurance agencies to offer our clients assistance and value in understanding the complexities of the Affordable Care Act, and how it impacts them and their employees. We have continued our shareholder friendly actions, maintaining a very competitive dividend yield with our current quarterly dividend at $0.38 per share. We have also continued to repurchase Paychex stock and acquired approximately 4 million shares of common stock in fiscal \u201815.  In summary, I am proud of our employees\u2019 efforts on behalf of our clients and our shareholders. They have continued to sell and deliver great solutions, drive high client satisfaction and record levels of client retention. We have a solid leadership team that is clearly focused on growth through sales and service execution, technology innovation, and product expansion in fiscal 2016 and beyond. They have delivered solid consistent top line growth and strong operating margins.  I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks Marty. I'd like to remind everyone that during today's conference call, we will make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve risks. Refer to our press release that includes a discussion of forward-looking statements and related risk factors. As Marty indicated, Paychex delivered solid results in fiscal 2015 coupled with improving metrics. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter and for the fiscal year. I'll then provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of the 2016 outlook. Total service revenue, up 8% for the quarter and 9% for the fiscal year. Interest on funds held for clients increased 5% for the fourth quarter and 3% for the fiscal year to $11 million and $42 million respectively. The fourth quarter increase was primarily the result of average interest rates, higher average interest rates and the increase for the fiscal year was driven more by higher average investment balances.  Expenses increased by 7% for the fourth quarter and 10% for the fiscal year. The increase was mainly in compensation-related costs with higher sales headcount and higher comp due to strong sales execution. Costs relating to the PEO minimum premium plan health insurance offering contributed 3 percentage points of the increase in total expenses for the fiscal year.  Operating margin was 35% for the fourth quarter. Operating income, net of certain items, increased 11% to $241 million for the fourth quarter and 7% as Martin mentioned earlier to $1 billion for fiscal 2015. Our operating margin, as many of you know, is typically lower in the second half of the year.  Net income growth increased 10% to $161 million for the fourth quarter and 8% to $675 million for the fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share increased 10% to $0.44 per share for the fourth quarter, and they increased 8% to $1.85 per share for fiscal 2015.  Let's look a little closer at payroll revenue. It increased 4% for both the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year. We benefited from increases in revenue per check and higher clients. Revenue per check was positively impacted by price increases, partially offset by discounting, coupled with the impact of increased product penetration.  Checks per payroll, which had been trending up in prior years, was relatively flat for fiscal 2015. Checks per payroll growth rates have returned to more historic norms, which were typically below 1%. HRS revenue increased 16% to $272 million for the fourth quarter and 18% to $1 billion for the fiscal year. The MPP [ph] plan health insurance offering, which was added in the second half of fiscal 2014 contributed 6 percentage points of growth in HRS for the fiscal year.  Paychex's HR Solutions experienced solid growth in clients and planned employees served; in particular, our PEO experienced strong demand during fiscal 2015. Retirement Services revenue benefited from pricing, together with growth in the number of plans and an increase in the average asset value over time and services, client employee funds. Insurance Services had a strong year, where revenue growth benefited from the ramp up of our new full service offering to comply with healthcare reform requirements and increase in the number of health and benefits applicants and higher average premiums and workers comp insurance services. Online HR administration products continued to grow due to success in the sales of SaaS Solutions, in particular of our time and attendance products.  Let's look at our investment and income; our primarily goal is to protect principal, but optimize our liquidity; long-term portfolio, which is primarily made up of high credit quality municipal bonds with an average yield of 1.6% and an average duration of 3.2 years. Combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 0.9% for the fourth quarter and 1% for fiscal 2015, which is consistent with 2014 fourth quarter and up slightly from last year. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients were flat for the fourth quarter, as increases attributable to our client base were offset by lower state unemployment insurance collections. For the fiscal year, average balances on funds held for clients increased due to growth in client base and wage inflation. Let's look at our financial position, remains strong with cash and corporate investment of $936 million as of the end of the year and no debt. Funds held for clients were $4.3 million compared to $4.2 billion as of May 2014. Funds held for clients vary widely as you know on a day-to-day basis and they averaged $4.1 billion for the fiscal year, a year-over-year increase of 3%.  Total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $14 million as of May 31, 2015 compared to $35 million as of the same period last year. Total stockholders\u2019 equity, $1.8 billion, reflecting $552 million in dividends paid during the fiscal year. Dividends paid represented 82% of net income, our return on equity for the past 12 months was 36%.  Cash flows from operations were $895 million for the fiscal year, 2% higher than last year. Higher net income and non-cash adjustments were partially offset by the impact of timing and working capital which was greater last year than it was this year.  Let's turn to fiscal 2016 guidance. And I will mention a few things that color both the yearly and the annual guidance and also the quarter, so we\u2019re clear on what we're expecting for the year. Our outlook is based on the fiscal year ending May 31, 2016 and it includes our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing without significant changes. I'll explain what we mean with by that in a second. Our guidance for 2016 is as follows : Payroll service revenue projected to increase in the range of 4% to 5%, compared to fiscal 2015. We don't expect much, if any, contribution from checks for payroll in 2015, although that number has bounced around a bit at this point. We think it will be largely flat, could be up a few tenths, it won't matter. The projected growth rate is based on anticipated client base growth and increases in revenue per check.  In addition, I want to call out some things specifically. In fiscal 2006 we have two additional payroll processing days. These will occur in the first and in the fourth quarter. So let me just say that again we're going to have two additional payroll processing days. We are punctilious about the stuff because we know you will ask us. They occur in the first and in the fourth quarters. HRS revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 10% to 13%. Both HRS revenue and total service revenue reflect the minimum premium plan offering within the PEO, will now have anniversaried and it's going to be a compare year-over-year, so 10% to 13% on HRS.  Total service revenue, expected to increase in the range of 7% to 8%. Net income is expected to increase in the range of 8% to 9%. We anticipate EPS to be comparable during each of the fourth quarters of the year. But timing of expenses during the year can change the pattern as it sometimes does. Let me just repeat that. We're anticipating net EPS will be comparable during each of the fourth quarters but timing of expenses during the year can change the pattern. Operating income, net of certain items as a percent of service revenue is expected to be approximately 38%. So before I get the question let me answer it. If you look at where we are and for operating income net of flow where we ended the year at about 37.5, we expect improvement and we think it will be approximately 38%. What does 38% mean? It could be 37.9, it could be 38.1, all of those are 38%. We don't anticipate that it will be 37.5. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 is expected to be consistent with the rate we experienced for this year, fiscal 2015.  Interest on funds is anticipated to be relatively flat compared to fiscal 2015. What this means, as I mentioned earlier, is that we are not anticipating at this point any change in that behavior. If it occurs we think it will be a second half event, second half of fiscal year '16 and we'll call it out when it happens. We haven't included anything in our guidance at this point. So let me finish with this; while we don't provide guidance on specific quarters, I think it's important to indicate at this point of the year that we anticipate that all of the quarters will fall within the range of total service revenue provided with one exception, which is the third quarter where we believe that HRS revenue will be -- is projected currently to be below the low end of the full year range. There is a number of factors influencing that, we can talk about them more in the Q&A, but third quarter we expect on HRS revenue not on payroll, and HRS revenue to fall below the low end of the full year range, has no impact, as I said, on full year guidance. So as you're adjusting your models take that into account.  Now before I turn things over to Marty I want to remind you that Paychex will be hosting an investor day on Wednesday July 15th. We will webcast it. The event will be a great opportunity to learn more about Paychex's technology and services and you'll see demos if you're here live, unfortunately can't webcast those easily. And you're going to see the power of our technology and why we're excited about what the future holds for the company. We'll also provide a longer term outlook at the event and we hope to see many of you in a few weeks. Please sign up so we get a sense of who is coming. So with that I will conclude and I turn it back over to Marty. Martin Mucci : Thanks, Efrain. Operator, we will now open the meeting to questions. Operator : Thank you so much. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Smitti Srethapramote with Morgan Stanley. Sir your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, Efrain. This is Daniel calling in for Smitti. You sort of invited the question, but I guess I will just go ahead and ask it anyway. Could you provide just a little more color on what\u2019s driving the third quarter, I guess movement in HRS? Efrain Rivera : Yeah, so the answer to that is that in the back half of this year, we had three vectors aligned. The first was real strong growth in the PEO, the start of our ACA compliance or ESR product and also strong performance in 401(k); all of those are more back half events and in particular impacted the third quarter. And so, when we get to that quarter the comparison will become a bit more complicated, and by the end of the year it will normalize. So that\u2019s basically what\u2019s going on. Unidentified Analyst : Got it, thanks. And then just thinking about Paychex Flex, it\u2019s been a few quarters now, so perhaps Marty you could talk a little bit about the rollout so far. And is the goal to transition as many clients as possible and perhaps you raised pricing a bit, and maybe you can just talk about the client reception you have seen so far? Martin Mucci : Yeah, we\u2019ve seen good reception on it. It\u2019s been a -- the effort is to go through so much feature functionality in it, and so it\u2019s been a big effort on the training of our sales reps and the clients, but it\u2019s going very well. I had an increasing level of penetration of sales folks selling Flex. We ended the year very strong, and we really have put all the incentives in place to continue to sell it in fiscal \u201916. So, I think we\u2019re going to be off to a really strong start. Not to mention, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve continued to add and enhance it. So you are going to see - like we added the recruiting and onboarding functionality totally integrated on Monday and released that. So I think these additional, these adds to the Flex platform are going to help a lot. So the goal is that\u2019s what we are selling, and I think so far the sales and the clients are very receptive to it. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And then is the goal basically to have SurePayroll and Flex and Flex Enterprise as the three foundations to your core offering, or will it continue to be more nuanced than that going forward? Martin Mucci : Yeah, basically, I think that\u2019s right. SurePayroll will kind of remain on its platform. That\u2019s really for that micro sized Flex and then Flex Enterprise will really be kind of -- has already kind of replaced what was kind of core in MMS. We have our Preview product, and we do sell that on the high end as well, and it\u2019s still a good product with a lot of feature and functionality for the high end, but we are finding that Flex is a great fit, Flex and Flex Enterprise are a great fit for the majority of our market, and that really will be the product set that we are selling, and in fact most clients have already kind of moved to it. It\u2019s not like there is a big migration. Certainly for the under 20, the core client base, there is no migration, that is Flex that really is our base. Unidentified Analyst : Perfect, thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company. Sir your line is open. Timothy McHugh : Yes, thanks. Just want to ask about client growth here, I guess 2% growth, it\u2019s consistent I guess with what you have seen, I think the last year or two. But given the kind of new bookings growth you have talked about seeing in the last couple of quarters, I guess, I guess I was a little surprised it wasn\u2019t a little higher. I guess how is that compared to what I guess what you expected and how maybe you are thinking about next year, and I guess is just contrast that with the kind of overall new bookings or kind of \u2013 I think there was a new revenue sold, you characterized it as last quarter? Efrain Rivera : Yeah, Tim so I think what we discovered, I think over the last 18 months is that there is a balance between revenue generated in new bookings and units generated in new bookings, and we're trying to strike a balance. When we've gone pure units, we don't get revenue in the way we want, when we go the pure revenue, we don't get the units we want, and what I think that represents is what you see there -- what that represents is the fact that we're striking a balance between the two, and from a plan perspective, a revenue generated, new bookings revenue, it was pretty much spot on what we expected.  And mix is playing a bigger impact in terms of what we sell. So, we have a number of different products, and frankly we would prefer a $2,200 client to a $1,100 client, and that's going to be reflected going forward in our thinking about how we look at units. Some units are better than other units. We want a mixture of both, but at the end of the day, we want revenue that's sustainable over the long term. Timothy McHugh : Okay. I think you had talked about new revenue sold last quarter kind of growing at a double digit pace. Can you give a sense of where Q4 and kind of the year ended up with regard to that metric? Martin Mucci : Yeah we stayed very consistent, I think overall on that. We ended up certainly for the year at double digit growth. In fact we're at the highest. For the year, we're at the highest growth in par we've had probably in eight years. So as Efrain said there is that balance, but we've given the sales folks a lot more product to sell, the team\u2019s selling approach that Mark Bottini and the team have done and we were selling much more multi-product upfront to the client instead of our older model of hey, sell them Payroll and comeback in with, do they need 401(k) and HR outsourcing. We're finding clients are really benefiting and we're benefiting from the fact that we're team selling upfront and giving the full value of the product.  So we're very bullish on how the -- par is -- our annualized revenue sold has done and exactly what Efrain said, it's that balance now, but in the end its revenue growth that we want and that's what we're getting. Timothy McHugh : And just a numbers clarification, I guess the growth in the outsourcing or HR outsourcing client, is that included in the payroll client growth rate that you quote or is that kind of a separate number? Efrain Rivera : So I\u2019ll give you the simple answer than the complicated one. So clients are clients. So if we tell you we are having 590,000, that's -- those are clients who are running payroll, are clients that are served by Paychex, actually who don't take payroll, include actually additional clients for the 590. So that's the number that we don't typically disclose, but if we did disclose, it would be well over 600,000 clients. So some clients do take HR services, but don't take payroll. And as that number becomes bigger, we'll start splitting it out. Timothy McHugh : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery. Your line is open. Joseph Foresi : Hi, I was wondering in next year's guidance, the revenue per check, what's the expectation there? And maybe you can quantify that and how are you're getting that increased revenue per check. Efrain Rivera : We're not giving specific guidance on revenue per check, Joe. If you look over the last three years and simply do the math you'll see over that period of time, our revenue per client, not revenue per check has grown about $1,000 over that period of time. In terms of revenue per check, how we're getting it, it's -- so we didn't give specific guidance on that, won't do that but it's a function of price. It's a function of additional products and features sold to clients I guess those are two big components. Joseph Foresi : Okay. I figured I'd try. Efrain Rivera : That's okay. Joseph Foresi : On the free cash flow side, it was basically flat sort of year-over-year. Could you just give us some idea of what your trajectory is if you're planning on growing it and if not what has changed on the CapEx side as we head forward? Efrain Rivera : Yes, so Joe I would just say that to really understand that, you need to look at the delta between the two years of working capital adjustments. Working capital adjustments last year were about $54 million and this year working capital adjustments were $9 million. That really accounts for the big difference. Our free cash flow number is a little perhaps different than others do but because we also include uses of cash for acquisitions. So we had a bigger acquisition last year than we did this year or more.  So it's a little bit funky. I just point you to the operating cash flows and that you can see that our operating cash flows were almost $900 million this year and then normalize the working capital adjustments, I think we were low this year, high last year. I think you're going to get to a number that\u2019s certainly in excess to $900 million on operating cash flow. And then of course there is all of the usage that we have for cash. But I don't anticipate by the way purchases for CapEx and property is really going to change all that much in the year. Joseph Foresi : Got it. So theoretically it goes up obviously based on\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Yeah, that's our expectation. Joseph Foresi : Got it okay. And then last one from me. HR\u2019s been a -- HRO has been a fairly strong driver here over the last, I don't know two years. Now anything that you're seeing internally that would spark maybe a derivative or second derivative catalyst as you had into FY '16 or should we expect kind most -- much more of the same just with maybe tougher comps. Efrain Rivera : I think that's our planning assumption, Joe. What we don't know, what we don't know is what market reaction will be to the -- what appears to be the beginning of the imposition of penalties for the 100 plus employer set at the beginning of 2016, and then the increased requirements on the 50 to 99 [ph] clients under ACA. Why am I pointing all that out, simply because that regulatory overhang is going to probably create some changes in behaviors for clients that may drive them to be more interested in looking at a PEO solution or looking at our the Affordable Care Act solution.  That's one -- the pace of regulation also, be the recent regulations on overtime also are going to drive more regulatory overhang. So I would say that our planning assumption is, as you said, but there is a number of factors in the environment that could impact that direction. Martin Mucci : Yeah, as Efrain said, I would say the recent overtime, something that\u2019s come out just the night before the last, I mean really, we think that could push our HR outsourcing because you're now going to need smaller businesses, are going to need to help with, not exempt and exempt rulings in the next year trying to figure out who is exempt and not exempt and time and attendance could be pushed as well. Because you're going to have to be more careful about tracking the hours and keeping a record of those from a compliance standpoint with all the overtime rules changing as well as, as Efrain said, I think enforcement\u2019s going to continue to pick up on things like ACA and overtime. Joseph Foresi : Thank you. Martin Mucci : Thanks Joe. Operator : Our next question\u2019s from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning, Martin and Efrain. Martin Mucci : Hey David. David Togut : Could you quantify your growth in net price increases expected for 2016? Efrain Rivera : I'd love to give you the exact number David, but I'll just say it's in the range of 2% to 4%. David Togut : 2% to 4% is gross or net? Efrain Rivera : That's going to be net. David Togut : Got it. And then you've highlighted above 50 basis points of operating margin expansion targeted for 2016. Could you talk about the drivers of that margin expansion and then more broadly how do you think about operating leverage beyond 2016? Efrain Rivera : Yeah, so I'd say it's a continuation, David of what we've done since Marty\u2019s been here, which is to say we want to deliver world class service, but we want to do it in a world class efficient way. And so we're balancing the investment in IT that drives better service with greater efficiency from service providers being very, very careful not to upset the balance on the service side, so that they continue to drive the right kind of service. So it's really -- that's a very circuitous way of saying we balance operating and IT expense to drive that result. I would say we target, we go and do a plan typically targeting at least 15 basis point of leverage. We come out a little bit higher, a little bit lower sometimes there. So I think that's certainly in the intermediate term kind of what we're expecting. Martin Mucci : Yes, I think you'll see us continue to drive it. It's just part of our DNA, as Efrain said. The technology spend is more leveled off now. We've got into a very good place there, about the level of spend. And so it's continued to be a significant investment, but it won't have the double digit increases that we saw for years.  And so and then on the operation side we've continued to find other ways of reducing space and cost and really do it more from a service perspective, but also from a leveraging perspective. So that will continue. It gets harder all the time but that\u2019s certainly part of the DNA that we take going forward every year. David Togut : Closing question on capital allocation, how do you think about dividend growth in the next year or two, and then for the cash that isn't allocated to dividend, how will you allocate that? Efrain Rivera : Yeah so we'd expect the dividend to grow roughly in line with earnings. That ultimately will be a discussion we have in July, that certainly would be the direction we'd go in that. It doesn't mean it's going to be point for point, but it will grow as earnings grow. And then we have some allocation for share buyback. You can see we brought back about 4 million shares and actually share count went down slightly this year. So we'll continue to do, to prevent too much dilution from occurring and with a modest bias downward.  And then finally M&A is important. Our pipeline is as robust as it has ever been. And we're very, very interested in a number of properties that are available, but we're only interested at the right price and will pass if we don't like what we see. David Togut : Got it. Thank you very much. Efrain Rivera : Okay thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Rick Eskelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Rick Eskelsen : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the first one, just wanted to drill in on the payroll revenue growth that you guys are expecting. It sounds like a lot of it's driven by mix and also the price increases. Just maybe a little more detail on what you're expecting for the acceleration at the top end in the guidance for payroll. Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think there always three things, Rick. One is, price obviously is important. That price also has an element, as you mentioned of mix that can impact the price also. We kind of lump that together with price. And then we expect unit growth. We had 2% unit growth this year. We would expect something comparable, perhaps even a little better next year. But that's -- those are the components of the payroll revenue growth. Rick Eskelsen : And then just switching to the technology, you guys have signaled that it's flattening out in terms of the increase in spending. Just -- now that you had several years of increased tax spending behind you, can you talk about what parts of the portfolio and offerings that you think are now more competitive, and what you still need to maybe do more on? Martin Mucci : Yeah, I feel very good about and very competitive in all sides, to be honest with you, and that was our goal really when we started increasing the spending about six years ago. One, on the core platform I think you will see changes in the user interface that are happening right now that will be expanding over the next few months. So I think you're going to get a much cleaner HTML5 interface and -- all of that work has been done to really drive clients, to all come by the way with a mobile first kind of view of things.  So making things very simple for clients, so they can get at everything, whether they're on a mobile, mobility app, whether they are on their mobile phone, whether on tablet, or whether they're online. And I feel very good about where we are on those fronts. The mobility app I think is the best in the business. And that -- and we continue to enhance everything that we have.  When you look at the mid-market space, kind of even the 20 and above 20 to 500 or so in particular, I think we're very well positioned now with Flex and everything that we're adding just like we added, Monday I mentioned, to have, to be able to add a new employee all electronically send everything out to them. They can be updated and then seamlessly one time put in from the time you are recruited right through to the time you may retire from that business has made us extremely competitive. And I think, just at the right time it's a competitive market out there. We\u2019re still seeing very good sales. So I feel very good about the investments we\u2019ve made in mobile, in the core base, SurePayroll, as well as the mid-market, all of those I feel very good.  And when you get to the ancillary products we\u2019ve done the same thing; 401(k) we continue to be the leader and in the PEO space they have been upgraded at the same time as we\u2019ve made these investments. So it\u2019s made us very competitive in the PEO space as well from a product functionality standpoint. Rick Eskelsen : Thanks. And then just the last one here, you talked about this a little bit earlier but on the healthcare reform, now that the Supreme Court ruling happened. What are your expectations for how that\u2019s going to drive clients moving forward? Do you think that there is any of your clients are kind of waiting and seeing and just sort of what, what does that do to your business? Thanks. Martin Mucci : Yeah, we had a nice bump in that the last six months, I think as clients started to really pay attention to it and I do think now we\u2019ll probably see another resurgence of interest in it. And then as Efrain, I think mentioned earlier, I think when you get to the end of the year and those first filings have to be done and the penalty start to come into the 100 plus employee clients, I think they are really going to get a lot of attention at that point. And so the 50 or up, below a 100 will have to file, or the 50 to 100 will have to file. So that will be an awakening, I think for them that well this is a lot more difficult. And I think this is going to be another good year for the ESR product that we have, that helps them with Affordable Care Act.  We can help them both monitor and judge kind of what they are doing on a day-to-day basis as well as the filing, and I think that puts us in a very strong position, particularly when you are a payroll and insurance client of ours. Rick Eskelsen : Thank you very much. Martin Mucci : You are welcome. Operator : Our next question\u2019s from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gary Bisbee : Hi guys. Good morning. So I guess the first question, just can you give us an update on penetration and I realize probably in the 10-K you will give us a couple of customer counts to think about on some of the big product categories. But it seems like most of the areas you are still very low penetration, payroll customer base and maybe just also how big is that opportunity? I mean could half of the payroll customers eventually buy some of these products and does that mean several years more growth and up sale of those? Thanks. Martin Mucci : Yeah, Gary I think it obviously depends on the product, but I think each one of these we\u2019ve progressed in our penetration. So we feel very good about that. I think all of them you are right we still continue to have low penetration and big opportunity in front of us, when you look at even health insurance. We had a good year in health insurance, increase in sales and they are still at only probably 2% or 3% of the population. And so I think as Affordable Care Act, adds more pressure on health insurance and having health insurance for your employees comes up, that\u2019s a great opportunity for us. When you look at 401(k) we\u2019ve been in it a long time. It\u2019s probably one of our best between that and workers comp our best penetrated product, still a lot of opportunity there, and we are kind of driving a 5%, 6% kind of growth in that all the time and have more plans than anybody else. And then PEO really we are perfectly positioned over the last year or so with our PEO functionality and the product and the strength of the sales team and that has just taken off. PEO has had very strong growth. So I think there is absolutely a lot of opportunity there. We have continued to move ahead in our penetration but still lots of great opportunity in front of us. Gary Bisbee : It sounds like the Affordable Care Act compliance has done really well in the last six months or so, since you have launched it. If we looked at your customer base, 50 plus employees, I mean is there a material amount who have signed up, or is that also just very, very early days at this point? Martin Mucci : What we would say -- I don\u2019t think we have given out the numbers exactly of who is -- but we have done probably about almost 25% to a third of those who we think could take it, have taken it, at this point. So we\u2019ve still got some opportunity there and again I think it\u2019s we are going to wait to see what the kind of the surge is after the end of the year, like into the calendar year and people start to see how much work is involved in filing and monitoring what they are doing with that. Gary Bisbee : Great, and then the retention, that\u2019s very positive, obviously - -do you have a sense how much of that is just better economy and small business health, due to the economy and what not versus just customers being much more satisfied and happy with the products, probably more of the second than the first but any commentary there, right now. Efrain Rivera : So Gary, so here\u2019s a comparison. So if you go back to the when we published this information we were at a 21% loss rate in \u201911, now since 2011. Yeah, Marty can talk to some of the specific things that we\u2019ve would been on the upside. I think we've just gotten much, much better. But I think it's partially economy, but partially the result of the lot of things that we\u2019ve done. Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think in '11 to '12 and a little bit to '13, it was much more the economy. What we're seeing now is much more about the service and the satisfaction levels. We've also gotten much better at getting into the -- very deeply into our service numbers and with what we call voice of the customer and you're getting immediate online kind of feedback. We also have set up national retention team that when we think a client is thinking about leaving, they go to a team that is focused nationally on retention and on preventing the loss and seeing what we can do to improve the situation. And that's been very helpful as well. So I think we've done a number -- and we've added 7/24 service, we've added multi-product centers for the larger, the more mid-market clients. So overall I think a lot of this, the last year, particularly year and half has been much more about service and product strength.  The other thing, there\u2019s service, customer service and then there is service from a functionality and feature set. I think both of those have been the bigger impact, the last year, year and half. Gary Bisbee : Great and then just one cleanup one. It looks like from the press release you have restated the average investment balances for funds from clients and corporate investment the year ago relative to what was in your press release a year ago. Why is that and is that sort of a one-time thing or you changed it going forward, thanks. Efrain Rivera : It\u2019s probably average, Gary. And I'm not entirely sure. My guess is since it's an average, the number could have bounced around a little bit. But I don't think it should have changed dramatically. I think it probably had something to do with the averages in that quarter. Gary Bisbee : Yes, okay. It looked like -- and it looked like the last quarter the same thing happened. The reason I ask is just the fund balance, if you use what was reported a year ago, looks like it grew 2.5, and I guess really today it\u2019s really saying no growth. Maybe let me ask a different way. On the pseudo [ph] rate\u2026 Efrain Rivera : We did call that out, I think, in the press release, that it didn't grow in Q4. But let me just say one thing Gary, before we go down a lengthy conversation on this; timing of when a quarter ends and begin can really kind of throw that number. So I just caution to look at what we say for year and six months as opposed to a given quarter. Gary Bisbee : Yeah and I guess just the last thing then just the pseudo rate drag which presumably continues for a while, and maybe a couple of years, that\u2019s getting to unemployment [ph], is that -- and I think you hold on to the pseudo money longer than a lot of the other buckets of withholding. So is that something we should think about being potentially a drag for the next two years or something on the growth of the [indiscernible] or is that something specifically\u2026 Efrain Rivera : I think it's going to have an impact at the margin. We do call that out in the press release that, that rates did impact the average client balances, probably not enough to make much of a difference. If you see, despite that Gary, our interest on funds held for clients were up 5% in the quarter. So it really shouldn't -- if it does become an issue what we'll call it out. Not anticipating that it will be one though. Gary Bisbee : Great, thank you. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Operator : Our next question is from Sara Gubbins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Sara Gubbins : Hi, thanks, good morning. You were talking about focusing on which units are growing. And I am wondering do you think we will see a shift towards larger clients overtime on average? Efrain Rivera : I think you'll see a shift overtime on higher value clients on average. So not necessarily larger but just understanding. I think we've gotten much, much better at understanding what a particular client's needs are and putting as Marty said, the right team selling approach in front of that client, and trying to balance out the revenue opportunity of that client with the resources we put against that client. So we need both, you need to fill the funnel, because some of the smaller clients become bigger clients, but we also have recognized that focusing solely on smaller clients, who don't have necessary the same life time value as a larger client, you need to have certain balance between the two. So we're trying to strike it, sometimes very well, sometimes not so well. So that's what we're doing. Sara Gubbins : And from a margin perspective, would that client that is buying a larger bundle be higher margin? Efrain Rivera : Yes, typically would be Sara. Sara Gubbins : Okay. Could you also give us an update on your planned sales headcount growth next year? Efrain Rivera : Yeah, so we're going to be growing sales headcount about 3%, this in next year's plan. Sara Gubbins : Okay, and then last question, is it fair to say that the impact of the two additional payroll days next year is a little less than 1% incremental to your payroll service revenue? Efrain Rivera : It is fair to say, it\u2019s precisely half a point. Sara Gubbins : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Glenn Green with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Glenn Greene : Thanks, good morning. Just actually following up on the last question, maybe you could give us the sales bookings growth expectations you're thinking about for fiscal '16. Can you sort of continue with this sort of double digit base? And you did allude to headcount growth of 3%. So it implied with that would be sort of the headcount productivity. Efrain Rivera : Yeah, I think directionally, we certainly are looking for double digit growth. I think we had a big year this year and some of that was included, obviously the Affordable Care Act products and PEO growth. So, but we're looking for the same kind of directional way to grow, which is about low double digit growth. Glenn Greene : Okay, and then Efrain, you alluded to the M&A pipeline being robust, but want to be sensitive on valuation, but maybe strategically where you're looking, where are you seeing the opportunities or what would you like to fill out? Efrain Rivera : I'll let Marty handle that. Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think really across the board, we look for client acquisition, so client base where we can grow our existing client base, as we look for some product tuck-ins. But we're in pretty good shape now. We had focused a lot on that over the last few years. But we look at expanding any of the areas, so anywhere from Payroll to 401(k), to PEO, across the board, and maybe a few new markets, we look international as well. We did an international acquisition in Germany about two years ago, now I guess. And so we continue to look in other countries and for ways to get in and get started. But growth in a lot of different ways, it's never been as robust. The problem, as Efrain said is getting it at the right valuation. Glenn Greene : Are there decent assets of sort of core meaningful, sort of core payroll clients, is that of interest and are there meaningful assets out there for sell? Martin Mucci : It's of interest, but I wouldn't say that there is anything out there right now, that's meaningful on the payroll side specifically. Everyone seems to be more interested in kind of staying the course and growing, and so at this point I don't -- we don't see as much there. There is certainly always a lot of small ones and we're very active with the sales team on that. But as far as the significant one I wouldn't say there is payroll one [ph] right there in front of this at this point. Glenn Greene : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Our next question is from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open. David Grossman : Thank you. Good morning. Martin Mucci : Hey, Dave. David Grossman : I was wondering if you can just go back to the HRS business and the bundle. So if you remove the PEO from those numbers, can you give us, I guess first fundamentally, if you think about when you just selling that bundle without the PEO as part of that, there is no insurance element that's an important part of the sale. Who are you really displacing there? Is there anybody or anything that you're displacing, or is this just an average [indiscernible] if you will or what's really being done internally? And can you give us a sense of just how big that bundled solution is when you again back out the PEO and what creative growth you're seeing in that business? Efrain Rivera : Yeah, so if you don\u2019t consider the PEO, David and I'll come back to PEO because you have to consider it. But if you don't consider, for a second most of those clients are internal Paychex clients, who have grown to a size where they would like to have, in particular HR outsourcing as part of the bundle. So I would say, if you are looking solely at that portion of the client base, it's mostly internal clients.  When you go to the PEO, that becomes a different animal because half -- almost half of the clients that we saw on the PEO are not clients of Paychex. So I can't tell you who we\u2019re taking share from, I can tell you that we had a very big year in PEO, worksite employees grew between 20% and 30% in the year. That's been -- that was our biggest year in many, many years in terms of PEO driven by ACA, better execution, great job by the HR sales force and also a great job by the ops people. So it's a little bit of a tale of two cities. Inside everything else is really more of an inside game. When you get to PEO specific, it's a combination of both inside and outside. David Grossman : And if you back it out, the PEO what is the bundled solution represented as a percentage of revenue? Efrain Rivera : Percentage of revenue\u2026 David Grossman : Yeah. Efrain Rivera : We don\u2019t disclose it. PEO still is not even -- it doesn't come close to half of the HR Services growth. So most of it is everything else meaning Retirement Services plus Insurance plus what we call our ASO offering. Those things are growing nicely. So in the absence of PEO, we'd still have a pretty nice growth rate on those businesses. David Grossman : Right. And then I guess if we could back to the concept of higher revenue per client, because it came up in a couple different comments, one, in the context of how you're driving the sales force and how to think about unit growth and our thinking of pricing, not just pricing in Payroll but pricing per client. So I think you said and maybe I just misunderstood this comment that it\u2019s -- the revenue per client is up $1,000 in the past few years and that sounds pretty high. So maybe you could explain a little bit about what that shift has been in terms of revenue per client today versus maybe what it was a couple of years ago and how we should think about where that's going to trend, particularly in the context of again this comment about bundled solution and trying to sell more into the existing business. Efrain Rivera : Yeah, David I'm looking at the data from \u201911. So in \u201811 our revenue per client was about $3,700 -- I'm sorry service revenue was about $3,600 and by 2015 it had grown to about $4,600. So that's really a function of what Marty has been saying, what\u2019s said at the beginning of the call which is, if you went back to where we were four or five years ago, and I think this is not well understood about the company, I think we were a hooks and ladder approach. So let's hook him with Payroll and then let's ladder on everything else. We recognized post-recession that and this, to be fair, the credit goes to the sales force, and to our sales leader, he said, look certain clients need certain solutions very predictably. Let's do the data analytics and understand by size who needs what. So we did it and we said you know what lo and behold, if you're -- I won't say the number but a client of a certain size you typically, in our base are going to take x, y and z. If we know that, then let's put the right sales people in front of that client and we have one doing that. So that's what you're seeing there. Obviously there is pricing too. So I don't want to completely oversell the point, but I do think we have simply gotten better at understanding when we have a client, and by the way, we had well over a 100,000 of them that we sold, we have a lot of opportunities to go in and say, hey here's what you really need, if you're a client of a certain size. And because of the breadth of what we offer, we have a lot more opportunities than most people to do that. So I think that's what's occurring there. David Grossman : So then, what's the right way to think that about the pricing units equation, because right now you're trending, as you mentioned about 2% client growth. So and that's everybody, right, I mean I guess that\u2019s Payroll but I know you said you got others, but how do you want us to think that about the pricing element, because it's really not that 3%. I mean it's really more driven by what the change in revenue per client\u2019s going to be rather than the change in payroll price? Efrain Rivera : Hey, I'm not ready to give a guidance on that, that's a good point. I think you can do the math. If you look at revenue -- basically we give you enough by giving all of the clients and the breakouts of service revenue and you can see what the growth in revenue per client has been, you can see this isn\u2019t a mystery, do the math and it's certainly mid-single digits or above. So we're playing two games here, and I think it's important to understand that we've evolved the way we think about approaching the market, not just get more units and then put pricing on the units, but get more units, get pricing and get the right mix of clients, so that we can sell more feature rich bundles.  Just one final point I would make, David. Right now, if you compare what our sales force sells today to 10 years ago, very different animal in the Payroll space. We've got three bundles that basically take you from a basic payroll bundle to what is a pretty integrated HCM suite, that you can sell under 50. So we are -- we allow the Payroll sales force to sell any one of those three bundles and we want them to capture the right set of revenue and we want to get the right mix of units, but we want to get as much share of wallet too as we can, when we have a sale. So you can model it out. I think we given enough info there to kind of come to some conclusions on that. David Grossman : Okay, great, thanks for that. And then just last, a little bit it\u2019s just repeated [ph] question here. You mentioned that we anniversary the minimum employment -- the change in the PEO in the second half of the last year. So was there any impact on the fourth quarter growth rate of 16%? Efrain Rivera : Yeah, this is the last time we'll call out. In the fourth quarter there was probably a pickup of about 1% in the quarter for minimum premium. So that brought it down to 15 or so, or probably a little bit under that, maybe between 14% and 15%. There were just a lot of, as I said before, vectors that lined up to drive -- deliver that quarter. By the way we have called it a year ago. So we were expecting that by the end of the year we were going to have a pretty strong fourth quarter and I think that when we have this discussion a year ago I think there were some concerns about the fact that we were back ended or ahead more of a backend bias to our guidance.  But we thought we've ended up -- end up in the fourth quarter with a strong quarter and we ended up in the fourth quarter with a strong quarter. So we expect obviously based on the guidance for growth rates to moderate somewhat but that will see how the year progresses. David Grossman : Right, but is there -- I guess that's what I was getting at, is there anything in the business that you're seeing that would support that deceleration or are you just saying you know what\u2026? Efrain Rivera : No, no, there are really kind of three specific things that support our thesis that it will decelerate. The first thing, as I said, the PEO worksite employee growth was tremendous in the year. So we started from a lower base and by the end of the year we had hit an all-time high in terms of work-site employees. So now I start at a higher base and it\u2019s -- I'd love to think I'll have exactly the same year. 30 years of experience tells me that it\u2019s probably not going to occur. That's the first thing. The second thing is the back half of the year we had strong sales of Affordable Care Act compliance products. We again think that that's going to moderate as we go through the year. And then the third thing is we had a very strong year in 401(k) and we expect that to moderate. That's a planning assumption. I would just say that's we said similar things last year and we were trying to project even more, even more a complex set of revenue and we came within several million dollars of what we expected to hit. So I think that's where we called it, we could end up being conservative. David Grossman : Hey, great. Thank you and good luck. Efrain Rivera : Okay, thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeffrey Silber : Thanks so much. Just a couple of quick numbers questions. Efrain, in the quarter, operating expenses rolling up a little less than 3% relative to the rest of the year, that [indiscernible] decelerated. Anything going on there specifically? Efrain Rivera : Basically it was just, Jeff the anniversaring of the minimum premium plan which was adopted in Q4. And so in our operating expenses you saw a low single digit that just because we're getting the more normalized compare on operating expenses in the quarter, that really kind of drove most of that difference. Jeffrey Silber : So that really shouldn't impact next year at all? Efrain Rivera : No. Jeffrey Silber : Okay, great and then your guidance for on interest on funds held for clients relatively flat. I understand you're not expecting any increase in interest expense, but shouldn't we see an increase in funds held for clients, that should drive that a little bit higher. Efrain Rivera : I think it should be higher, Jeff. I think there is an element of conservatism in that number but what I'd say is this when the Fed raises rates will help a better sense of what the shape of yield curve is. And right now I\u2019m duration neutral  Better sense of what the shape of the yield curve is and right now I'm duration neutral. If we like the yield curve then we may extend a bit. And so right now my thinking is duration relatively neutral, I know where the intermediate portion of the bond yield curve is. And all of that equates to flattish. It's probably going to be a bit up from where we're at, but not enough to really materially change things until I have a sense of what the Fed\u2019s doing and what it signals more importantly, when it does its first increase, whether it going to signal rapid future increases or not.  I would just say we've been faked out so much than I'm a little bit gun shy in terms of making any calls on what's going to happen. So that's our book process. Jeffrey Silber : Okay, great, I understand, thanks so much. Operator : Our next question is from Jim MacDonald with First Analysis. Your line is open. Jim MacDonald : Yeah, good morning guys. Could you give us some of your thoughts on the middle market area? How it's doing and what your expectations are for next year? Efrain Rivera : Yeah, I think this year is -- right now as we're heading into '16. I think we feel good about the product and feature set that's out there for our sales folks to sell. I think we're feeling we've had some kick offs to the fiscal year already for the sales team. And there is a lot of excitement there. Obviously some competition has cropped up over the last couple of years but we don't see that having a big impact so far. So I think the market has somewhat expanded. I do think the need for HR and time and attendance and so forth has come down market. So that mid-market is anything from frankly from 20, 25 plus. And we're seeing a lot more need there.  So I feel pretty good that the mid-market in '16 will be a strong year for us and that's what we're planning on. And then we're well positioned for both from a sales experience and sales team, very fully trained and full staffed. And then from a product and feature set and service perspective we're in good shape. Jim MacDonald : Great, and then you talked a lot about the ACA but at the risk of adding one more. So any impact in January of a 1095 form, do you think that will have any kind of material impact? And do you think the charge will be similar or more than say W2. Efrain Rivera : Well, I think for the whole service we're charging kind of a monthly charge that gives you both monitoring and recording. And so I don't think you'll see any big blip or big change there. The big change would be if we sale a lot more of it because in that timeframe, they start to realize that there is a penalties that the filing is more difficult than they think and so forth. And so I don't think you'll see any big blip in Q3 because of that. What you'll hopefully see is more sales all through the year and we'll continue to update Jim that as we go through the quarters. Jim MacDonald : Okay, thanks a lot. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Operator : Our next question is from Chenjin Wong [ph] with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning. Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Just on the client side, I know I heard a lot about shifting towards higher value clients. That all make sense but I'm curious, how -- from a unit perspective how is SurePayroll performing because I guess we could infer that there is a mix shift away from that. Efrain Rivera : So I don't think that's a fair assumption. I think that they -- SurePayroll is doing fine, relatively a small part of our revenue base, as said in the past. Sure really doesn't influence the revenue picture very much a little bit. Certainly revenues influences the unit picture but no significant change from that perspective. I want to be careful it could be misunderstood that we don't think that microenterprise space is important. We think it is important and it's important for a number of different reasons, not just because it represents a source of revenue, but a lot of those clients, we now see, have an opportunity to become full service outsourced clients. And if they build the right relationships with Paychex their lifetime value will be significant.  So we're not pivoting away from that, just thinking through how best to maximize the revenue opportunity we have with each sale. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Yeah I know you pretty much have sort of talked about the sort of this the pendulum between do yourself and outsourcing for a while. Just feel like it shifting towards outsourcing on my side. But I'm curious are you seeing any new trends there and just lastly the clarification on retention, can you -- did you give revenue retention as well as unit retention? Efrain Rivera : I didn\u2019t give revenue retention, revenue retention this last year was about 86%. Martin Mucci : And I don\u2019t think we are seeing a big shift or anything, but as Efrain said SurePayroll\u2019s still doing well in that micro market. We are certainly still feeling good about the under 20 here and what we are seeing in selling on that side. I don\u2019t think there has been a big shift, although I do think that it -- everything is kind of coming down, as I said. So there is more need for even the under 20, more of getting -- we\u2019ve had good success in selling time clocks and now the online time and attendance, even to smaller clients that we didn\u2019t think would need it. I think that may drive more to outsource because it\u2019s not just simple payroll calculations where they are doing it themselves. I think they will look more for a well-rounded offering that integrates everything and that like time and attendance you can punch in and punch out on the mobile phone now.  So as those things keep getting easier and better integrated and coming down market I think more small will outsource. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah, okay good, thanks guys appreciate the update. See you in a couple of weeks. Martin Mucci : All right. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Good morning Marty and Efrain. Martin Mucci : Good morning. Mark Marcon : With regards to your MMS clients, what percentage are on the latest version, the most up-to-date version of your solution? Martin Mucci : Yeah, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve really given that out yet. We\u2019re going through -- the clients we are getting good satisfaction on the existing product. I would say the new sales are definitely leaning 70%-80% toward the new product, and featured functionality set, that that\u2019s fitting those. And I think you will see that shipped close to that, 90% to 100% in this upcoming fiscal year and then other clients will move over. There is not a big forced migration or any need for that, necessarily at all because they are still happy with the former product. But I would say it\u2019s from a sales perspective it\u2019s 80% and we\u2019ll be growing and existing base and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve really given that out.  So but it\u2019s -- we\u2019ve given that Flex Enterprise has been growing here. It\u2019s a pretty small -- it\u2019s a fairly small percentage and but we\u2019ll continue to grow obviously over the next two years. Mark Marcon : I am assuming the satisfaction level with Flex is higher than the base, is that correct? Martin Mucci : Yeah, although the base is pretty comfortable with the product we haven\u2019t -- it\u2019s not like there is a major issue there. I think it\u2019s more but Flex is little bit higher, but it\u2019s not -- the base is not like totally unsatisfied or leaving or anything like that. We would step up the migration but we\u2019re not seeing that. I think it\u2019s, Flex is driving a lot more to the clients. Our goal there is to pull them over by saying hey, look at the additional feature, functionality integration and online opportunities you have there from this offering than what you have but there is not any general dissatisfaction with the existing product at this point. Mark Marcon : Okay, and then with regards to the retention rate, I mean it\u2019s improved nicely over the years. Where do you think that can ultimately go to, do you think you have hit a peak level or do you think there is still room for improvement with regards to that retention rate assuming the economic environment doesn\u2019t change? Martin Mucci : Yeah, it\u2019s a good question, I think we always struggle with it. I think we\u2019re feeling very strong that it\u2019s over 82%. It\u2019s obviously the best we\u2019ve ever had. I think we\u2019ll continue to try that. We\u2019re always trying to drive it a little bit higher. Can you get it pass 83% or 84%, given that small client and the rate of turnover? I think you might be able to get it up another 50 to 100 basis points, maybe a little bit more overtime but it\u2019s a struggle, but it is really what we are driving now and John Gibson leading the service team is really driving a lot of service options in trying to with this voice of the customer we are getting great feedback.  We are responding to the customers even faster and we\u2019re learning how much effort. We now have systems that are learning how much effort they have to put into to either mobile online or talking to the payroll specialist and then we can kind of build their service around it, so it\u2019s much more sophisticated. Who knows maybe we could drive it to 83% to 83.5% or something. I don\u2019t think too much further than that. Mark Marcon : Okay, and then with regards to the delta between the bookings growth relative to the total service revenue growth, can you just go through the -- why those wouldn't be closer? Efrain Rivera : Well, I'm not sure why you have assumed that Mark. Remember that each year in order to grow [indiscernible], replace the 18% [ph] clients plus get an incremental growth. So even if you had a real strong year in terms of sales you wouldn't see that reflected unless you had a series of those years in a row reflected in the base. So I think we are comfortable that we're seeing revenue growth in the base, but you just don't see it from one year to the other. Mark Marcon : Got it. And what percentage of the client base currently is getting the 1095 or has signed up for the 1095 program? Efrain Rivera : We're not discussing that number. But Marty indicated that of the people that we thought -- early in the call, the people that we thought might be clients it was 25% plus. Mark Marcon : Great, thank you. Efrain Rivera : Okay thanks Mark. Operator : Your next question is from Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Your line is open. Lisa Ellis : Hey guys. To what extent are you or the PEO and HR outsourcing markets more broadly, do you think impacted, if we see this big wave of consolidation across HMOs as well as other HR service providers? Efrain Rivera : I think there is going to still be plenty of choice out there and opportunity to offer. You got to remember if they're combining and we are still going to have, I think very competitive products to compete. I don't think it's everyone are going to combine so much that you don't have enough choice and competition there. So I don't think it will impact us too much at this point. I think actually to some degree it might make it easier from an operational perspective. We -- when we got into the health insurance business, selling health insurance years ago we have to go out and connect with the top three carriers in every city and the number were -- it gets to be very large and complicated, to the degree that, that begins to consolidate it might make operationally things even easier, and you might actually have a little bit more clout with getting connection issues resolved and actually make the business more efficient.  So I think we have to wait and see how it is but I think the choice was -- enough choice will still be there. And I think actually it might even improve some of the customer service by the connections we have with them. Lisa Ellis : Got it, and then it looks like SG&A for the full year was up 9% this past year, with a little bit of I guess lumpy uptick in this last quarter. You mention that headcount growth you're targeting about 3% next year. Does that mean that we would expect SG&A growth to moderate relative to this year? Efrain Rivera : It should moderate a bit. We just had a really a very, very strong sales growth this year. We expect it to be good next year but probably moderate a bit from the growth rate that we saw this year. Lisa Ellis : Terrific, thanks. Operator : Our next question\u2019s from Phil Stiller with Citi. Your line is open. Phil Stiller : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I've just couple of quick follow-ups. Efrain you said the two extra payroll days this year will add about 50 basis points to the growth rates. Just wondering what the impact on fiscal '17 will be if you have that analysis. Are we going to lose all of that 50 basis points or can\u2026? Efrain Rivera : Good question, Phil. I haven\u2019t and I will tell you this, I have buried in trying to figure out this call plus the Board meeting. So I haven\u2019t looked at '17. It will have an impact. It's hard to say without understanding what -- where we end up from a client perspective and some of the other revenue issues we discussed. So it will have some modest impact on '17, too early to call. Phil Stiller : Okay, and then lastly on M&A, I guess you talked about it earlier but on the valuation commentary without being sensitive. I guess what metrics are you looking at? Are you willing to buy things that have higher multiples than your own stock? Efrain Rivera : We -- when asked this question Marty and I -- we look at technology and we understand that if someone\u2019s got a nice mousetrap we are going to have to pay for it. But that's why we think, being in a position of financial strength is important. So we look at it differently if it's a pure technology buy or it's primarily technology, or if it's more of a client based play or a mixture of both. So our metrics adjust based on what it is we are buying. You pay for innovation, we understand that. So we\u2019re willing to look at businesses that we think have good technology but we are not willing to excessively overpay for that technology. Phil Stiller : Okay, thanks. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Our last question is from Matt O\u2019Neill with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Matthew O\u2019Neill: Hey guys, thanks for sneaking me in at the end here. I just had a quick clarification, the 590 in clients, is that inclusive of SurePayroll? Efrain Rivera : Correct, yes, it would be. Matthew O\u2019Neill: Got it. And then just noticing some recent announcements from some new entrants/potential competitors, most recently yesterday Square kind of formulized their payroll offering at least in California anyway. Is there any kind of anecdotal evidence you guys are hearing reported back from your sales force as far as dynamics or shifts or anything kind of going on the competitive front or is it still the usual players that we are all used to, that you guys see day in day out? Martin Mucci : Yeah, it\u2019s still pretty much the usual players. I know that obviously there has been a lot of announcements but it really hasn\u2019t -- we haven\u2019t seen a big impact there, some for price but I think when they look at the feature functionality, the size of the company, whether it\u2019s public or not, meaning that you are trusting your payroll taxes, a very significant cost as a small business with someone and that limited functionality and the limited compliance resources, when you think about Paychex we have 200 people that focus on compliance and been able to deal with all the agencies federal, state and local, it has not been a big impact at this point. We certainly take all competitors very seriously but we haven\u2019t seen a big impact at this point at all. Matthew O\u2019Neill: Got it, and so based on the sort of sales strategy of going kind of all-in, would you actually quantify it as potentially being harder for a new entrant to compete against somebody like you, with that backdrop, I guess of product offerings? Efrain Rivera : So Matt we\u2019ll talk about this at our Investor Day and I think that what, the people who pitched the segregation pieces are selling is the notion that integrated solutions are less important than getting the best deal in every disaggregated portion of the bundle. We can tell you that when you tie that together with technology and you have very good offerings in each of the service areas that a small medium size enterprise wants, that\u2019s a wining preposition. That\u2019s what they are looking for and then put world class service on top of that with a great mobile platform, you got a pretty powerful combination.  So if you are going to compete against that with one cheap payroll offering I think you are going to be challenged. Matthew O\u2019Neill: Got it, thanks very much. I won\u2019t take any more time. Efrain Rivera : Good, thanks. Operator : That is all the questions we have gentlemen. Martin Mucci : All right, thank you. At this point we\u2019ll close the meeting and if you are interesting in replaying the webcast of this conference call it will be archived until August 3rd. Thank you for your interest in Paychex. We very much appreciate your participation in our call and we look forward hopefully to see many of you at our Investor Day in just a few weeks in Rochester, New York. Thank you and take care. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference call we thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. And have a great rest of your day.",

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point. I'll now turn the meeting over to your host, Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Sir you may begin. Martin Mucci : Great, thank you. And thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex's First Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2015, and our earnings release and Form 10-Q will be made available on our Investor Relations page at paychex.com. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month. On today\u2019s call, I'll review highlights for the first quarter in relation to operations, sales and product innovation. Efrain will review our first quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance, and then we'll open it up for your questions. We're off to a good start in fiscal 2016 with positive results across our major product lines. We've continued our momentum in both sales and new product enhancements. Client satisfaction and client retention also remain at high levels. Payroll service revenue growth of 5% was in line with our expectations and we also continue to see strong demand for our human resource outsourcing solutions including double-digit growth in client work site employees served. Total service revenue grew 8% in the first quarter. I want to mention very important to us that Paychex was recognized as a leader in the July 2015 Gartner Magic Quadrant for payroll business outsourcing services advancing from our challenger position in 2014. The 2015 Magic Quadrant evaluates the capabilities of 12 key providers of payroll BPO services across the globe and I would like to read to you some of the facts that came out of Gartner's release. Paychex ranked highest of all participating providers in overall satisfaction across payroll functions, technology, provider customer relationship and payroll BPO service outcomes. Our strengths according to Gartner and our clients -- the survey of our clients, was a clear focus on our target market, ease of implementation and use, and investment and innovation, Paychex's integrated HCM platform, Paychex Flex, better aligned to the technologies internally and the company has demonstrated significant innovation in mobile phone and tablet apps. We're very proud of this and the fact that the leader designation by Gartner means that we execute well against current vision and are well positioned for the future. So we're very proud of that and I am very proud of the entire Paychex team that was instrumental in achieving this designation. It fits a lot of what we've been talking about over the last few years about our significant increased investment in innovation and product. The launch last year of Paychex Flex, our cloud-based integrated human capital management platform, provides us the ability to deliver a streamlined and integrated workforce management solution to a broad range of clients. This platform gives our clients the features and functionality they need today and also allows them to easily add services as their needs change and the Gartner designation as an innovation leader is the result of our commitment to that investment in both technology and client service, focusing on the clients and the total value proposition to them. At our Investor Day in July, many of you have the opportunity to learn more about Paychex's Flex and our integrated software-as-a-service solution suite of HCM products. We're very proud of our leading edge technology and the strength of Paychex's Flex is at the single platform utilizing the single employee record in addition to a number of client service options. We recently launched our Paychex Flex hiring module, which gives employers access to paperless recruiting and employee screening, along with a robust onboarding model for a seamless flow of information and data access. At HR Tech, we plan to announce additional enhancements to Flex with the integration of employee benefits and time and attendance functionality, which will round out the HCM suite. We now have the most robust mobility offerings for both administrative users and employee self service that allow access to all of our HCM suite from a single mobile application. Last fiscal year, we launched our full service Paychex's Employer Shared Responsibility Service to assist clients navigating the Affordable Care Act. Our ESR product includes a monthly monitoring service with automatic alerts as well as yearend reporting on Forms 1094 and Forms 1095. We're pleased with the level of continued client acceptance that we've experienced. The positive momentum we saw in fiscal 2015 in sales execution has continued solidly into 2016. Our integrated team selling approach continues to produce strong results by introducing a full suite of product value that Paychex can offer our clients upfront. Our execution and service operations has continued its standard of excellence, demonstrated by strong client satisfaction results and client retention levels that remain consistent with recent highs. Our innovative leading edge technology, coupled with this exceptional client service makes us different in the market and that\u2019s what we focus on. We\u2019ve also continued to take steps to add additional value to our shareholders. In July, we increased our quarterly dividend 11% to $0.42 a share maintaining a very competitive dividend yield, one of the highest in our industry. We've also continued to repurchase Paychex's stock and acquired another 1.3 million shares of common stock in the first quarter of '16 -- fiscal '16. In summary, we\u2019re off to a solid start for sales, service, product strength and financial performance for fiscal 2016 and I appreciate the great work of the 13,000 Paychex employee team across the country. I'll now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks Marty. Good morning to all of you. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risk referred to the usual disclaimers. As Marty indicated our first quarter financial results for fiscal 2016 show we're off to a solid start for the year. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter. I'll provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of our 2016 outlook. Total service revenue grew 8% for the first quarter to $712 million. Interest on funds held for clients increased 6% for the first quarter to $11 million. Now we\u2019ve had a number of quarters in a row where we've strung together increases on funds held for clients. So that part of the P&L is starting to bounce back. This was driven in part by 2% increase in average investment balances. Expenses increased 7% for the first quarter, primarily driven by higher compensation related cost and growth in our PEO. The increase in compensation related cost was driven by higher wages and performance-based comp cost. Operating income, net of certain items, increased 11% to $285 million for the quarter. We achieved operating margins of 40% up from 39% in the prior year quarter. Remember that our operating margins typically are higher in the first half of the year. At this stage in the year, we anticipate our full year operating margin will fall within the guidance we have provided. We'll update again of course in Q2. Our effective income tax rate was 29.7% for the first quarter compared to 36.3% last year. This change is due to the recognition of a net tax benefit on income derived in prior years from customer facing software we produced. During the past quarter, we engaged a leading specialist in the area to assess the qualification on our software for the federal qualified production activities deduction. Based on this assessment, we concluded that certain of our software offerings qualified for this tax deduction in prior years and therefore recognized the tax benefits and related tax reserves as a discrete item during the period. This action dovetails with Marty\u2019s comments. We're a technology enabled service provider and our spending, our cost reflect this, as does the recognition we're receiving in the marketplace. Net income increased 22% to $209 million and diluted earnings per share increased 23% to $0.58 per share. The net tax benefit I just mentioned resulted in an increase in diluted EPS of $0.06. Let me emphasize again that the impacted diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.06, that's what we expect it will be through the year as you look at your models. Obviously that was not contemplated in the guidance we gave. Excluding this net tax benefit, both net income and diluted earnings per share would have increased 11%. Payroll service revenue increased 5% for the first quarter to $433 million. We benefited from increases in revenue per check and client base. In addition we have one additional payroll processing day in the first quarter, compared to the same quarter last year. Revenue per check as a result of pricing -- I am sorry, revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting. And on the payroll service revenue, I'll just remind you what we said last quarter that we think that the addition of extra days would result in approximately one half of a percent to the growth in payroll service revenue for the year. We won\u2019t break it down by quarters. HRS revenue grew 15% to $280 million for the first quarter. This increase reflect strong growth in both clients and work site employees at Paychex HR services, which includes our ASO and PEO products. Insurance services benefited from continuing growth of our full service ESR product assisting clients with healthcare reform and increase in health and benefits applicants and higher average premiums and clients in our Worker\u2019s Compensation Insurance product. Our HR Administration and time and attendance products contributed to the growth through sales of success of these solutions and as I mentioned at the Investor Day, these products are typically sold as part of the bundle in our payroll packages. Retirement services revenue benefited from an increase in the number of plans and an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value participants funds. Turning to our investment portfolio, our goal is to predict, protect principal and optimize liquidity, on the short term side primary short term investment vehicles were bank demand deposit accounts, high quality commercial paper and variable rate demand notes. In our longer term portfolio, we continue to invest primarily in high credit quality and municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. Government securities. Our long term portfolio has an average yield of 1.7% and average duration of 3.3 years. Our combined portfolio is an average rate of return of 1% for the first quarter and as I mentioned again, in last year's quarter, we have not factored into our guidance any changes in the interest rate environment although it\u2019s looking like that will happen in either Q2 or Q3. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased during first quarter, primarily driven by growth in our client base. I'll now walk you through the results of our financial position. We remain strong with cash and total corporate investments of $954 million as of August 2015 and we have no debt. Funds held for clients as of August were $3.7 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31, 2015. However funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.8 billion for the quarter a year-over-year increase of 2% and it\u2019s the average that counts. Our total available for sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $24 million as of the end of August, compared with a net unrealized gain of [$40] [ph] million as of the end of May. Total stockholder's equity was $1.8 billion as of August, reflecting a $152 million in dividends paid during the first quarter and 63 million of common shares repurchased. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 38%. Our cash flows from operations were $278 million for the first quarter, an increase of 6% over the prior year period. This change is primarily a result of higher net income partially offset by fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities. The fluctuation in operating assets and liabilities were primarily related to the timing and collections from clients and payments for compensation, PEO payroll and income taxes, working capital was what created the change there in our cash flows. I'd like to remind you that our outlook is based upon our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes and I just mentioned we\u2019re anticipated at some point during the year that the federal raise rates. With that proviso, our guidance for fiscal 2016 is as followed : Payroll service revenue continues to be anticipated in the range of 4% to 5%, HRS revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 10% to 13%, although we we're higher. Obviously in Q1, we think that there will be a moderation in growth rates as the year progresses. Total service revenue is anticipated to be in the range of 7% to 8% and net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 8% to 9%. Remember please that I called out the change in the discrete tax item which was $0.06. So our range excludes the benefit of the net tax benefit we recorded in the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year excluding the impact of the net tax benefit discussed will be approximately 36%. Our interest on funds held for clients and operating income net of certain items as a percentage of service revenue are expected to be consistent with prior guidance and all other aspects of guidance that we discussed on the Q4 call are unchanged. I will now turn it back to Marty. Martin Mucci : Thank you, Efrain, and now operator, we'll open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mr. SK Prasad Borra from Goldman Sachs. Sir, you line is open. SK Prasad : Thanks for taking my question, two if I may. Help me, to start off, Marty to what extent the full year guidance is just being more conservative and given you have such a strong stock through the year, are you expecting second and third quarters to slow down and if that's going to be related to more processing days or something more to think about? Efrain Rivera : SK, this is Efrain. I\u2019ll take that. So we're always glad to have a strong start to the year that helps and increases our confidence in the guidance for the year, but one quarter doesn\u2019t make a year. I will say also that we called out that Q3 was going to be somewhat weaker than the other quarter. So there probably is an element of conservatism in our guidance, but at this point, we're not going to peg it any higher. We\u2019ll update in Q2 as we see results for the year come in. SK Prasad : Okay. That\u2019s great. Probably just second question, with regards to what you guys were talking about at the Investor Day. The focus clearly seems to be on generating more revenue per client, but client growth also is something we should probably benefit from sales and marketing investments. Are you seeing any progress on that or would say that from your end, it\u2019s very clearly going to be just revenue per client and client per growth should stay at 2% to 3% levels at best. Efrain Rivera : Yes, SK, I think \u2013 no, I think we're seeing progress on both. We don\u2019t give the client growth until the end of the year once a year, but it's very consistent, I think we're showing consistency in both where the team is selling the integrated selling upfront is doing well on the revenue side from the packages and of course the new products that we're rolling out, but it's also driving more interest in more clients and selling more clients. We\u2019d always like it as strong as it could be and it\u2019s early and selling season will tell us a lot more here in the next quarter or so, but no, we're pushing hard for both and we're making progress on both. SK Prasad : Probably, just last one on competitive landscape, have you seen any changes at all given the acceleration in investments by a lot of the newer start ups, especially in the payroll space? Martin Mucci : Not really. I think we continue to see good results from a selling perspective and so while they're out there, I don\u2019t think anyone has -- no one has the sales team that we have, the distribution model and the number of sales people and the effectiveness. And so on the low end I think they sell very effectively and the low end being size, and then certainly the mid market, I think we're at the strongest -- we continue to be at the strongest position we've ever been in from a product and service perspective. So we really haven\u2019t seen a lot of changes. If anything I would say we\u2019re in a better position than we were last year at this time. SK Prasad : That\u2019s great. Thanks Marty, thanks Efrain. Efrain Rivera : Thank you, SK. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. David Togut of Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Efrain Rivera : Hi David. David Togut : Could you gauge net price increases that you're realizing both in the payroll services and human resources services business this year? Efrain Rivera : Yes. A little bit different on HRS and we typically don\u2019t get real specific about how much we take. That\u2019s a little bit different typically from payroll service, some day, some years I should say. We don\u2019t increase certain product lines, but I would say on payroll services, we're solidly within the 2% to 4% guideline and don\u2019t appear to be having any problem holding that -- those price increases. David Togut : Got it. And could you ballpark for us what the bookings growth was in the quarter? Efrain Rivera : No, we won\u2019t do that. It was strong, we feel pretty good about it. I would just say this David, not to be too coy because I get that question all the time, what really matters is how we did in the selling season and so much -- you're going to have a good quarter and we've had good quarters in the past first and second and not had a good selling season in third quarter. So we feel pretty encouraged about where we started the year. We think it bodes well for selling season, but we're not in selling season yet and we'll update when we get there. Martin Mucci : Yes. I think that's very -- very consistently we feel very good about it as we did at the end of the year and didn\u2019t have any bumps getting off to a good start, but as Efrain said, the selling season makes the difference for us. David Togut : Understood. Thank you very much. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Thanks David. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Smitti Srethapramote from Morgan Stanley. Sir your line is open. Smitti Srethapramote : Great, thank you. First question is on the PEO space, one of your competitors has recently seen higher medical claim cost and even though you guys haven\u2019t experienced those given you're exposed to different states, can you talk about whether or not that's impacted your view on taking insurance risk? Efrain Rivera : Yes, good question. So we saw the same, excuse me, saw the same things that have been seen in the market. We saw the results I should say. Our experience is very different. We employ teams of actuaries and set our -- set our premium expense very, very conservatively. So there is no guarantee you can have a hiccup, but we do a lot to minimize it. We also have pretty low -- we have pretty conservative ceilings for reinsurance and I think all of that is great. But I think the most critical part of the entire equation is what you do from an underwriting standpoint when a client is presented to you? One of the things that we did, this was before I got here and one of the things that Marty instituted was a very clear line between the authority that underwriters have and sales have. While they operate cooperatively, we task our underwriters with protecting the quality of the pool and that has served us very well. So there is inherent risk in that area, but I think we manage it very well. When we looked at what others were doing and how they had structured their approach to risk, it was a bit different from what we do. Smitti Srethapramote : Okay. Thanks. And maybe continuing on the PEO side, can you provide more details on the growth rate of your worksite employee count and whether that's still in the 20s? Efrain Rivera : Yes. We won\u2019t update the worksite employee count to give you specific numbers. We'll eventually release all of that information, but I would say it is fair to say that part of the reason why Q1 results were strong was that PEO was an element of strength in the quarter. So we continue to do very well in that area. Smitti Srethapramote : Okay. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Sir, your line is open. Martin Mucci : Hi Jason. Jason Kupferberg : Hey there. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to just pick on the PEO topic as well here to start, the momentum that you're seeing there to what extent do you think it\u2019s coming from share gains versus the general rising tide lifting a lot of boats just given the catalyst of the Affordable Care Act? Martin Mucci : I think obviously a lot of it is coming from the Affordable Care Act. I think there is just a lot of interest in the market, but I think at the same time, because we're kind of a proven leader in the space and I've a very good sales team on this, I think we're picking up more share of what\u2019s now becoming a PEO sale. So I\u2019d say, Jason, it\u2019s a bit of both because there is such an interest now particularly as it's getting closer and closer to respond to the Affordable Care Act from a PEO standpoint frankly and an insurance standpoint and because of our positioning of our product and our success, we're picking up more share. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. And then just switching gears over to Flex hiring, if we try and just get a bead on magnitude of contribution, obviously it's an important offering, is there material revenue baked into this year's guidance for it or should we think of it as more of a potentially material contributor in fiscal '17? Martin Mucci : I\u2019d say probably more of a contributor in '17 because it's going to take a while to build up, but it's adding a lot of strength to the packages that we\u2019re providing. Not only is it giving them full recruiting and hiring, but we\u2019re selling -- you can -- we sell onboarding as even a separate offering, which is a paperless onboarding that doesn\u2019t have to be a mid-market sale. It can be a 20 person that hires a lot and it\u2019s all paperless from an onboarding perspective. So I\u2019d say this year it\u2019s kind of getting started and you\u2019ll see a start to it, but the bigger magnitude of it will come in future years and starting in '17. Jason Kupferberg : And just last one for me. I wanted to catch-up on the M&A pipeline, because it felt -- appeared at a time like you guys had sort of opened the aperture a little bit in terms of opportunities you were willing to consider. Obviously you're staying disciplined in evaluating those opportunities, but would you say there\u2019s been any directional move in the pipeline in terms of it being closer to bearing fruit versus not in recent months? Martin Mucci : Yeah, I\u2019d say so, although you never know till you get to the finish line, but we certainly have been very active in a number of fronts on it and -- but as you said, we're still being very disciplined. So we've a pretty wide funnel at the beginning. We bring it down pretty tightly to where we think it\u2019s a reasonable valuation that's going to add a lot of value to us, but we\u2019ve got -- there\u2019s a few things in a hopper now that we\u2019re evaluating. Did they get over the finish line, you never know till we\u2019re ready to announce, but we\u2019re very active in it, that's for sure. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. We\u2019ll stay tuned. Thank you. Martin Mucci : All right. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Sir, your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Hey good morning Marty and Efrain. Marty, I wanted to ask you about the Paychex's Flex and the percentage of customers that have converted to that particular version of Payroll processing? Martin Mucci : It\u2019s hard -- the basic product that we have what was Paychex's Next Generation, all clients are on Paychex's Next Gen, then Flex adds kind of a another full product suite to that. So we\u2019re in the process of moving some of the clients over. But there is a number of clients that are already on what I would say is the foundation of it. So a lot of clients are not going to see -- the majority of our clients are not going to see any movement. They\u2019re not being moved to anything unless they drive -- this is more of a mid-market product suite that they are going to see more and they\u2019re being offered that. We\u2019re still offering the old product suite. What we\u2019re saying is, hey, if you want to come over to a fully -- a full suite for human capital management that is fully integrated within a single employee record, we will move you over. So we\u2019re kind of in the early stages of that, but it\u2019s not a big push to force everybody over. It\u2019s more -- hey if you want these additional enhancements come over and it\u2019s really targeted more in that mid-market space. The majority of our clients won\u2019t see a move. So there\u2019s not going to be any disruption that we expect there at all. Kartik Mehta : I guess, I was getting to Marty -- is there -- have you see a -- are we experiencing greater sales of products as people have moved over to Flex especially in the mid market, concerning there will probably be more demand for some of your products? Martin Mucci : Yes, it\u2019s early, but I think yes. That\u2019s what they\u2019re looking for and so that\u2019s why we\u2019re excited with the Gartner change to put us as a leader because that\u2019s what they\u2019re looking for is that full suite of products, fully integrated single employee record and data base and we\u2019re seeing an increased demand there. And I think if you were to talk to the sales team, particularly in the mid market, we just left the sales conference of our top performers a few weeks ago and extreme excitement about selling the product and being very competitive in the marketplace. So, I think, it\u2019s early, but you\u2019ll start to see that really pick up at it will add as we talked about a little bit earlier, much more product per client. Kartik Mehta : And then Efrain, just any change in philosophy in how you manage a flow portfolio considering there might be interest rate increases going forward here? Efrain Rivera : Not yet, but it\u2019s on my list of objectives. So, Kartik, what we need to know is when they\u2019re going to raise and then what the increase in the -- the rate of increase will be. And I think that that\u2019s been signaling as directly is I\u2019ve ever heard it, signal when it\u2019s going to happen? And I expect that when they signal or when they implement their first increase, they\u2019ll give some direction as to what we can expect then in subsequent increases. That will permit you to decide how to position duration of the portfolio. So I\u2019m waiting for all of that information to get a better sense of how we sit down and strategize around the best way to position the portfolio. So that\u2019s coming in the -- probably in the second half of the year. Kartik Mehta : Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Martin Mucci : Thanks Kartik. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is open. Rick Eskelsen : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. The first question is just, you said you just came from a sales conference. I was curious, what feedback you heard from your sales people on any potential changes to client behavior, given the financial market weakness and also some of the concerns about the global economy? Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think generally, when we release for monthly small business index and in fact I was just in New York City yesterday because we\u2019ve expanded it now for different industries, we're seeing continued -- particularly in the small business under 50, we\u2019re seeing continued better employment growth than prerecession levels of 2004 and so -- and it\u2019s down a little bit from last year, but it\u2019s consistently above that level. So we\u2019re feeling like a steady improvement in small business formation and employment hiring and I would say the sales folks certainly felt that way. I think the bigger excitement at the Sales Conference was just about the products that we're rolling out in the full feature in the strength of the competitive offering along with the service options, now 7/24 service and a lot of different options that more self-service that clients can provide. So they were pretty excited first to be there. Obviously their top performers and second, that they got a good year in front of them they feel. Rick Eskelsen : Thank you. And then on the ESR offering, do you have -- just wondering if you could give an update on how that's progressing, what percentage of the clients that you think might take it have taken it so far? And does it feel like it\u2019s going to be down to the wire type of offering where people take it at the very end? Thank you. Martin Mucci : Yeah, sure. I don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t really release I don't think how many are taking it from yet at this point. I would say it\u2019s very active and I think it will be active down to end. We continue to provide it to our clients. I know some competitors have stopped providing it. If there is a lot of work involved then we're making sure that the clients upfront understand that there is a lot of information needed from the client for us to do this successfully for them, but I think we\u2019re handling it very well. We\u2019ve increased the resources who are selling it. We've increased the resources who are supporting it because we're continuing to offer it and I think this will be -- yeah I think this will be pretty active right through the end of the year and I think then there will be another surge probably after people who realize -- clients who realize, hey I should have had this when it comes time to file and now I need it. So I think we'll have kind of another resurgence of sales probably in the end of the first or second calendar quarter of next year, but it\u2019s going very well, it\u2019s going very well. Rick Eskelsen : Thank you very much. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open. Gary Bisbee : Hi, good morning. Martin Mucci : Hi Gary. Gary Bisbee : First question, you talked a lot about the success in selling bundled offerings in recent years, but one thing I don\u2019t think we've heard as much commentary on is just how you approach up-selling additional components of products into the basin and what the success has been in doing so and any commentary you can provide on that? Martin Mucci : Yes, sure. Gary one of the points I've tried to make is one of the things we shifted, typically our model was sell payroll and then the other sales forces with the other products come in kind of after that pretty much on a timetable basis. You get someone comfortable with payroll then you come in and talk to them about the value of 401-K record keeping about the value of HR outsourcing, insurances etcetera. Now what we found is certain client sizes and complexity of the client, we come into that client with an integrated team selling approach over the last, I would say year, year and half now, and it's been very successful. So what we found was we were not selling the full value of what the client was looking for many times in our old approach and so if we see a client that's a certain number of employees, has a certain hiring pattern, has a certain complexity to their business, we'll go in with multiple sales forces or multiple sales of products and sell them all at the same time and that's been going very well. I think once we got the sales teams comfortable with it, they've been more successful and we're getting a nice track record as we get this -- as we get some real momentum going. Efrain Rivera : Let me build on that, what Marty said so that's the team selling approach. On the other side of it, we've done a lot of data analysis, a lot of modeling based on predictive behavior modeling and we have models that basically predict what your -- the next best offering will be when you don\u2019t take a bundle. So that science keeps getting better and better. So we know at certain stages of your lifecycle and based on what products you\u2019re doing and the characteristics -- your client characteristics, your customer characteristics, what offering is likely to be the most successful. So we deploy those models out to the sales force too. So both of those have -- approaches have helped us become more efficient. Gary Bisbee : Is that a telesales -- the selling of more stuff to existing customers or is it your feet on the street? Martin Mucci : No, it\u2019s -- actually it\u2019s more of the feet on the street. It\u2019s -- I think we\u2019re much more effective on the telesales side as well, but that\u2019s been really more for the single product sale or a follow-up sale. But the feet on the street have been much more on the integrated team selling approach, because we have many offices, but obviously have multiple sales teams, but they're just kind of approach the client at different stages and now if the client is the right -- looks like the right fit for multiple products they\u2019ll go out and sell as a team and we\u2019re finding some good success in that. Gary Bisbee : Okay. And then just the 15% HRS growth obviously continue to be really good but is that a clean like-for-like number or was there a little bit of benefit still from the mix with the minimum premium health plan or is that really\u2026 Efrain Rivera : No, there is always going to be a little bit of benefit from MPP, but that wasn\u2019t a significant part of what happened actually because you were -- we have the same product mix in the quarter, but MPP really did not dramatically impact that number. It really was strength of PEO, strength of VSR and frankly across a lot of other HRS products. Gary Bisbee : Okay. And then just a last one, I know you talked about M&A, but you\u2019re going to do things only if you can get the right pricing and what not. How should we think about just the cash build from here? Are you likely -- I think you've indicated special dividend, didn't seem of real interest, I know you\u2019ve been doing some buybacks but a lot less than your cash flow. Should we think that the likely approach is just continuing to build cash until you do find the M&A or are there any other options that you\u2019re\u2026 Martin Mucci : Yeah, Gary I get this question a lot and what\u2019s difficult and my answer always is the same, what\u2019s difficult for the street to evaluate what we\u2019re doing is you don\u2019t have insight into the pipeline and the probability of our pulling the trigger on deals. I would say that most -- you can assume that most of the deals that occur in the Fin Tech space of any reasonable size we've looked at and that for whatever reason we've decided on evaluation that didn\u2019t permit us to get to the finish line, because we\u2019re pretty disciplined about how we go about it. Having said all of that, the pipeline as Marty said is pretty robust and so we see a number of opportunities that we\u2019d like and we\u2019d prefer to simply have the cash to move quickly and deploy it in first instance. To the extent that we got to a point where really the pipeline looked -- didn\u2019t look as robust and I think that we\u2019d start looking at other ways to deploy cash to shareholders. But part of the way we do that and part of our confidence in the future is that, in this summer we boosted dividend pretty significantly and we've been buying back shares. If you look at our share count vis-\u00e0-vis the last quarter you see the bias is downward, which is something that we started a couple of years. So all three of those are elements to how we\u2019re looking at cash. But in terms of large cash outlay beyond dividends, we think the pipeline, there\u2019s opportunities there in the space. And we think that valuations have come down to a point where there\u2019s a number of things -- opportunities that seem reasonable now that maybe weren\u2019t reasonable 18 to 24 months ago. Gary Bisbee : Great. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Ms. Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ma\u2019am your line is open. Sara Gubins : Hi thanks, good morning. It sounds like your margins outperformed in the first quarter versus your internal plans, is that fair and if we ask you to talk about what drove the upside? Martin Mucci : Boy Sara, that's a pretty interesting deduction. Yes, they were a little bit stronger than we had anticipated. However, I would say this. So there is two elements that always typically in the first quarter, we're trying to peg how quickly we go out of the gate in spending and so it\u2019s typically the case that we're a little bit slower. So some of that is timing I would say and then we did well in sales and we feel pretty positive about that. We still don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough throughout. We're still not confident enough throughout the remainder of the year to call it as an upside to where we are, but we certainly had a strong start to the quarter -- to the year I should say. Sara Gubins : Okay. Great, and then switching gears back to healthcare reform and the ACA product, it sounds like it continues to grow strong and you think that that could continue for a couple of more quarters. How much of a lift is it to the average revenue per client? Efrain Rivera : I don\u2019t think we've really from a competitive standpoint we haven\u2019t given out all the pricing and so forth. So to be careful and I don\u2019t want to say too much, but I would say it\u2019s a significant increase, it\u2019s a pretty significant it's I don't know for a\u2026 Martin Mucci : Good uplift and you see it in HRS. So\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Yes, yes. Martin Mucci : And we're seeing a lot of success for that. I am not trying to be clear about it, but I just want to be careful how I am talking about the pricing of it because there is just a lot of discussion about pricing of Affordable Care Act and there is a lot of different plans out there right now that people are saying they're doing certain things and I think clients got to look very carefully at pricing and what they're getting for the product that they're buying. Because some are giving them a lot, I think we're giving them a very full valued service and others are kind of giving them a form to fill in and I think that\u2019s what may shake out here towards the end as clients are going to be little surprised may be at what they bought and what they didn\u2019t buy. But it continues to have really nice momentum for us. Sales are doing well with it. A number of sales teams are selling it and as Efrain said, you're really seeing it in the HRS revenue uplift. Efrain Rivera : But one thing I would add to that Sara is that PEO was strong, ASO was strong, HR outsourcing in general was strong. So what ESR has done is it\u2019s had a bit of a Halo effect on a number of other products. Even when you don\u2019t sell the product it permits you to get in the door to have a conversation. I think there are very few clients that won\u2019t entertain a call about what they're doing with respect to ACA compliance because there is so much confusion in the market about it. Sara Gubins : Okay. Great and then last quarter you had said that you're about a quarter to a third and have penetrated for a potential client that might take it. Is that as high now as half? Is it going that rapidly? Efrain Rivera : I think that\u2019s probably a reasonable range in terms of where we are at here. Where we end up is something that we're just monitoring to see. Martin Mucci : Yes, I think that's fair. Sara Gubins : Thanks a lot. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Jim MacDonald of First Analysis. Sir, your line is open. Jim MacDonald : Yes, good morning guys. Martin Mucci : Good morning. Jim MacDonald : Just a couple more on the ACA, so I think you mentioned is sorry, that's an HRS revenue, HR revenue, not payroll. Efrain Rivera : Correct, yes that\u2019s reported in HRS. Jim MacDonald : And have you recognized much revenue from that or does it get recognized as you kind of bring the clients on Board or how about like ramp up how to be show we think about that? Efrain Rivera : Yeah, so what\u2019s you're seeing now is we really started building in the back half of last year. So you start to see the benefit of that in this quarter. So you're starting to see the pickup from the number of clients that we signed on in that. We'll watch through as we go through the year and by the time we're at the end of the year pretty close to having recognized most of it, most of the increase I should say. Jim MacDonald : By yearend and just on a different part of ACA with a number of the public exchange you're seeing pretty high price increases for their health products and they're eliminating products. Any impact -- can you talk about the impact of that on you guys in this fall enrollment type season? Efrain Rivera : I think it\u2019s kind of couple of different impacts. One, we're not seeing it impact this much on the pure insurance sales basis too much yet because they haven\u2019t seen all of those increases aren\u2019t all out yet there. You'll see it probably all of it into this next couple of weeks actually as they roll up. The only thing I would say is that because of the work in the PEO and the MPP plan, we've seen a very competitive low increases there for our products and I think that\u2019s helped us a lot. That\u2019s part of the reason when you took on a little bit more risk in that because we felt we could manage that very well and it's been very good for us on much I would say much lower increases to our clients under those plans than the national averages certainly that we're seeing the regional averages. So I think it\u2019s going to -- it's benefitting and we'll continue to be a benefit for us particularly in the PEO side where we have an MPP and on the health insurance side, I haven\u2019t quite seen it yet, but Jim our clients aren\u2019t going to have a lot of choice there if they don\u2019t have in more cities they're going to have carriers that are all going double-digit increases unfortunately -- but we haven\u2019t seen a big impact to slow anything down from an insurance standpoint. Jim MacDonald : Great, thanks a lot. Martin Mucci : Welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Sir your line is open. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much, kind of an obscure question here about a month or so ago, the National Labor Relations Board had a ruling that people believe could in fact affect the franchise business where unions are going to be able to negotiate with the franchise ors. If I remember correctly, you do a lot of work in the franchise area, please correct me if I am wrong, but if you do, have you heard or seen any impact -- potential impact on your business accordingly thanks? Martin Mucci : Yes sure. We've not seen it yet. I do think that it\u2019s one of those things that's just another negative that's out there that it makes people little bit slower on maybe hiring or starting up an additional franchise let's say. If I own a couple of franchises, I might be just a little more cautious on whether I start another one or not based on the ruling. I think a lot of that still got to shake out, but it certainly adds more confusion and concern to those. We don\u2019t have a ton of franchise sales. When you look at in the scheme of our sales and our client base, but it's certainly increasing because we've done a lot of work in selling the franchise side, but that's been picking up. So I would say we don\u2019t have an impact yet, but I do think it may generally put a little bit of damp around whether I open up a second franchise or not. Jeff Silber : Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Is your franchise exposure on the payroll side, the HRS side, or mix? Martin Mucci : Mix, mix. We sell all products to the franchises. Jeff Silber : Okay. Great. Appreciate the color, thanks. Martin Mucci : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Tim McHugh from William Blair. Sir, your line is open. Stephen Sheldon : Hi, it\u2019s Stephen Sheldon in for Tim. Most of my questions have been answered, but just want to ask as we get a little closer to the key selling season, can you may be talk generally about the where the sales works currently stand and have you been doing hiring? How are recent hires been ramping in terms of productivity just any color on how you're positioned there would be appreciated. Martin Mucci : Yes. I think we're in good shape going in from first of all from just being very -- we got all the hires in. Training is done, I think Mark Bottini and the leadership team did a great job in getting everyone in kicking of the year really well. We've sales kicks offs, lot of training during the first quarter and so forth on new products. I think we're at a great positioning of training for example. We do an awful lot now of web training and so forth and from a client -- from a growth of sales I would say we are up about normal like we normally add to the sales force. We had our ads and we were pretty much right on track. The good news is everybody is in the seats, well trained and particularly with all the product changes they're well versed in the product and we could feel that in the momentum of it at the Sales Award Conference. Stephen Sheldon : Okay. Great thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird. Sir, your line is open. Mark Marcon : Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Martin Mucci : Good morning. Mark Marcon : You got a really nice start to the year. Martin Mucci : Yes, thank you. Mark Marcon : Could we drill down just a little bit with regards to just the core payroll, the acceleration we saw this quarter? Did you say there was like one extra processing period in this\u2026 Martin Mucci : Yes. One extra processing day. Mark Marcon : And how much of an impact did that have? Martin Mucci : Yes. Good question, Mark. I won\u2019t say specifically for the quarter, but we're going to have two of them this year and we think that the impact will be half a percent. So if you use arithmetic averages you can figure out what the impact was. Mark Marcon : Just to be specific the 0.5% is for the total year. Martin Mucci : Correct. Mark Marcon : Okay. And the other quarter that it will -- we\u2019ll see this impact will be. Martin Mucci : Is it the fourth quarter? Efrain Rivera : The fourth. Martin Mucci : Fourth sorry Mark Marcon : The fourth quarter. Martin Mucci : Yes. I am sorry. Mark Marcon : Okay. Great. And then you also mentioned that we should be cognizant on the third quarter. Martin Mucci : Yes. Mark Marcon : Can you remind this? Martin Mucci : Yeah, so I quote that out, I would just refer back to my comments in Q4, I quote out, at this point we think that that quarter will be just -- it\u2019s more timing and will go into a long amount of detailed update in Q2, but that will be weakest of the quarters. It\u2019s mostly about timing of different revenue flows within that quarter and I quote that HRS is potentially being below the range of the full year guidance. I said that in Q4. We\u2019ll update in Q2, but we expect Q3 will be relatively speaking the weaker of the four quarters in the year. Mark Marcon : And then with regards to this -- for the quarter that we just had on the core side, even when we strip out the impact of the processing there, we\u2019re still doing well. Can you talk about the biggest single driver behind that in terms of -- you certainly saw pricing stick through, you've had good bookings, but what would you say would be the primary driver? Martin Mucci : Well, I think it\u2019s a combination of holding the price and retention. When you look at that immediate quarter sales were obviously -- we\u2019re very comfortable and positive on sales, but the impact is when you retain the clients and as I mentioned we continue to be at our best client retention levels. And on top of that, we\u2019re holding the price increase in the range that Efrain gave. So it was a good start to the year, that\u2019s when you see kind of that first quarter you see what happened with the price, indeed we have to take more discounting and so forth and we felt good about holding the price and felt very good about the client retention as well, good job on the service team. Mark Marcon : And did the retention ramp up at all? Martin Mucci : Since we don\u2019t give it, I would say it\u2019s very consistent with where we ended the year, which was a record high. Mark Marcon : Okay. Efrain Rivera : The other thing Mark that I\u2019d call out is we didn\u2019t say anything about checks per client. Obviously there is a lot of things to talk about that were positives. But checks per client were flat to down in the quarter and so when you compare one quarter over another, we still were seeing positive results in checks per client through much of last year. We didn\u2019t see that benefit, that\u2019s a mix issue that I had called out in the past. So we feel pretty good about where we were from a field service revenue standpoint. Mark Marcon : Absolutely and then with regards to just the client segments that you\u2019re seeing the strongest growth from, is it -- would it typically be in that six employee to a 11 or maybe a little bit slightly higher? Martin Mucci : I would say it\u2019s across the Board. It\u2019s not like the quarter that we\u2019re seeing any one segment pick up better. The good news to us is we\u2019re doing well in the let\u2019s say our typical under 20 segment and we\u2019re also doing well and better I think even because of the product and the service options in the mid market. So I would say it\u2019s across the Board. Mark Marcon : Okay. And exclusive of that kind of the really small one the former or share payroll plays? Efrain Rivera : No, that's included, so it\u2019s both. Mark Marcon : Okay. And then congrats on the upper quadrant that\u2019s relatively early, any sense for the ability of the sales force to leverage the improved recognition? Martin Mucci : I think we\u2019re just \u2013 it\u2019s pretty recent, but we\u2019ll certainly find any way we can. They\u2019re certainly very excited about it because it\u2019s always exciting to see third party particularly like Gartner puts you into that leadership position and that it\u2019s based on our clients being surveyed. And our client saying hey this is a great product and a great service and then Gartner coming out of it saying, hey not only is it good now, but you\u2019re leader because you're positioned well for the future. So we\u2019ll definitely be looking to capitalize on it. And knowing the sales team they\u2019re well trained and well versed in the things that are happening with Paychex's they will be able to capitalize on it well. Efrain Rivera : And the other thing Mark I\u2019d add to that is that, Marty's strategy really started seven years ago about investing in IT and I want to reiterate two things. One is that, this is part of the strategy of how we move Paychex from where we were prerecession to where we are right now. And I think it's been a long time in the making number one and second, I think that external validation is a lot better and more powerful than simply trumpeting what you think, what you believe about yourself. So I would say there is a lot of smack talk by competition about how good they are? We don\u2019t talk that way, except right now and we prefer to let third parties validate how good we are and let our customers validate how good we are. We could not have had that honor unless our customers thought very highly about what we do, that\u2019s the second point. Then the third point is that a lot of our spending now our increases in spending have been around IT and it helped us from the standpoint of being able to go to and might build a credible case that we were entitled to certain treatment of the expenses we were making based on the strategy that we employed. So I think it validates a lot of different things that the Management Team has put in place. Mark Marcon : Great to hear. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay Mark, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the Ms. Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Ma\u2019am your line is open. Lisa Ellis : Hi, good morning guys. A good question on the team selling approaches you\u2019ve implemented that over the last year, year and half, can you dimensionalize the range, the upside you\u2019re seeing in revenue per client, when you\u2019re able to sell in the fuller suite of services? Martin Mucci : I think, it's pretty significant when you sell it upfront. It's also a timing thing remember because I would assume that we're -- normally we\u2019re selling those other products but a little bit farther down the road, but we\u2019re finding one, we\u2019re selling more of it upfront. Two, I think by offering the total package, we're selling more of it because we're hitting the client at a time that they see the full value more than just selling them payroll and coming back later. I don\u2019t know if we give the exact percentage or anything, but it\u2019s certainly double digit increase in over the kind of the revenue per client that we would normally see upfront. We just want to get more of that over time, but then I do think we\u2019re having more success, we may have -- we thought we may have been missing some opportunities actually by selling kind of a payroll-only and then coming back later when the client upfront may have felt better particularly today in saying I really wanted HR outsourcing altogether. I wanted a PEO or an ASO offering and that\u2019s what I really needed. I needed and that\u2019s what we\u2019re finding because that's come down a lot in employee size and so it fit the team selling very, very well. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Good, and then just one quick follow-up on retention, I think you said, I just wanted to confirm you said retention is kind of holding at -- holding relatively stable? Martin Mucci : Yes, that's right. Lisa Ellis : Perfect. Thanks guys. Martin Mucci : All right. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. Tian Jing Wang from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open. Tian Jing Wang : Great, thanks. Good morning, good quarter here. Just on the HRS side, I heard that it was little bit better the PEO, the moderation comment for the rest of the year, is there anything specific there that we should be aware or it was just the previous comments on conservatism? Martin Mucci : Well first of all, there is some conservatism, so we'll come back in Q2 and update, but the other thing Tian Jing is we had really strong -- we had really strong HRS growth in the back half of the year led by PEO. And when you start anniversarying some tougher compares and there is some revenue shifts going on within quarters particularly in Q3. So we want to get a little bit more of a sense how the year is building before we do anything to guidance. Tian Jing Wang : Okay. Just wanted to make sure and then just on the -- just one more, just on the back of the minimum premium concept here, I know it's -- on the earlier side for you, but have you given any sense of what the mix now is of minimum premium versus the fully insured plans in terms of what you\u2019re selling, what's taking and what's not? Martin Mucci : It\u2019s still less than 50% of what we sell in the PEO and remember the reason why I say that is that it's only in the State of Florida. So we have our PEO business in Texas and California and a number of other important states. And for the -- at least for the near future, that\u2019s where it will remain, but Marty mentioned earlier and I think it was in response to a question about what's happening with healthcare premium increases, we're very, very competitively positioned. So we\u2019ll see and monitor how we do throughout the remainder of the year. We feel really good about both our underwriting standards and also what we've been able to do with that plan. So that could change as time goes on. Tian Jing Wang : Okay, good to know. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Mr. David Grossman of Stifel Financial. Sir, your line is open. David Grossman : Thank you. Good morning. Efrain Rivera : Hey David. David Grossman : I was just hoping to follow-up on a portion I think that's been asked in several different ways over the course of the call and that\u2019s really getting into this whole concept of unit versus revenue per client growth and how we should think about how that's evolving. And I think you've given us several data points on what\u2019s driving revenue per client, but show your details on exactly how to think about that specifically in terms of percentages and how to think about your model longer term in terms of how that could impact the growth rate? So perhaps, I know that\u2019s a long winded question, but perhaps you could give us some more information or insight into how that should evolve and the impact to growth rate? Martin Mucci : I think, first of all, it\u2019s still very balanced. We're going after both and I think we've been -- obviously I think we probably went on the side of much more revenue per client growth the last few years as we added additional product. And so that makes the sales team very successful and we did well on raising the revenue per client, excuse me, but that\u2019s because we had so much more product and product bundles and we were very successful with that. That kind of shifted us back to hey how do you balance that and so I think what you're finding is the sales team much more focused and compensation plans etcetera in training on both. Hey we want to increase the units and we've talked about where we wanted to be in unit growth in the past in that client growth and we're continuing to push to get there and we've seen very consistency through the first quarter. We're trying to continue to balance both of those. We're feeling really good about the revenue per unit continuing to increase because of the fuller product set and the offerings that we have and the success in selling it and then -- and retaining it by the way. And then the unit peace is we're finding other ways to do that not only with the sales on the street, but from a more of a digital marketing and web based product or web based service or more, people coming in that way buying more payroll-only kind of thing and doing that with telesales. So I just want to make sure it's clear. Hey we're looking to balance both. I think we're going to have success in both, but I would say that revenue per unit is what's been stronger the last couple of years and that seems to continue. Efrain, anything you want to add to it. Efrain Rivera : That's right. Martin Mucci : Okay. David Grossman : And so should we think of the unit growth being driven more if you will on the smaller client size who are perhaps using one product like payroll or is that over simplification? Martin Mucci : I think that\u2019s over simplification. I think we're pushing -- like I would just -- well I would that's typically obviously where we see most of the growth because 80% of the clients are still under 20, and half of our sales come from brand new businesses, so that certainly is fair to say. But I would say we're feeling much better about the mid market strength given the product suite that human capital management full suite of products. So I think units are going to come from there as well. It\u2019s a little bit -- it's obviously a little bit longer sales cycle and so forth. So I would -- I think it's fair to say that since half of the sales still come pretty much from brand new businesses that the units are going to come from at least half of them are coming from smaller payroll-only generally, but I think you're going to continue to see the growth in the mid market better than it has in the last few years because of the product suite. David Grossman : Right. And then just one other follow-up question is again related to a question that's been asked several times, just about the Affordable Care Act and how it's impacting the overall business. Could you just give us a sense, I think you said Marty, that you saw surge and then you're seeing -- you're expecting and want to get into calendar '16, people may recognize they didn\u2019t do enough, if I understood your comments correctly, is that the way to think about it in terms of just very simple out about in terms of the timing of when it could affect your business differently than it has in the last several quarters? Martin Mucci : I think so. I think it\u2019s referenced and I think as the sales come in now and they're I think for this stage, they\u2019ll peak probably in the October, November, the sales will, then you\u2019ll start to get the full revenue of that on a monthly basis right after that. And the clients, I think clients will see because we talked about kind of the percentage that are taking it of the ones we think it applies to, I think clients will see in the March, April, probably even May timeframe because the filings are in March, they\u2019ll start to see gee, I should have done more or it did apply to me and I didn\u2019t think so or I just didn\u2019t take the time to address it. I think sales will pick back up then. I\u2019m not sure that will have a big impact in Q4 for us because it will be a little bit late in that process, but I do think sales will pick back up in April and May for those who didn\u2019t take it, that\u2019s my guess at this point based on what we\u2019re seeing. Because some clients are just -- some are great, they\u2019re all over it. They\u2019re taken it. Others are waiting kind of late in the game, but I think we\u2019ll see that and then I think you\u2019re going to see a number of them that say I still don't get it. I\u2019m not going to do anything until I have to and then they\u2019re going to have to react in April. David Grossman : Okay. And then just one last question just on the impact of potentially of higher rates Efrain, so it would appear at least in this fiscal year given higher position it would have a nominal impact and then we would just factor in that you\u2019re going to stay short on the curve at least for the time being or perhaps should we think about this a little bit differently if we do get an increase in rate over the next six months. Efrain Rivera : Yes, David I think you\u2019re right until I get a better sense of how that develops it's really tough to figure out what the duration is, whether we should barbell the duration whether -- what the best value on the curve is. You could do a lot of modeling. We\u2019ve looked at it looking at forward rates, so it doesn\u2019t really give you a sense of what\u2019s the best strategy to employ. So since we get a sense of when they\u2019re going to raise and get better insight because I think the fed should tell us and what the pace of change is going to be then I think we can figure out what makes more sense in terms of configuring the portfolio. David Grossman : Okay. Very good and congratulations on a great quarter. Efrain Rivera : Thanks David. Operator : Our last question comes from Mr. Phil Stiller of Citigroup. Sir your line is open. Efrain Rivera : Hi Phil. Phil Stiller : Hi guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. Just wanted to ask about M&A further on that topic. So maybe you guys talked about the pipeline being busy. Perhaps maybe give us a little more color in terms of what types of opportunities you\u2019re considering whether it\u2019s market expansionary, new products and then also perhaps some commentary on the size might be helpful in terms of how big the targets are considered? Martin Mucci : I think -- I'll start with a size standpoint; it's been anything from small to pretty large that hasn\u2019t concerned us too much at all. The second thing is not as much about product now adding product because I think we\u2019ve really done that well over the acquisitions we've done over the last few years and frankly that's what's exciting now as when you see recruiting. We don\u2019t even mention this, but when you see recruiting and onboarding roll into the Flex products suite, that's myStaffingPro, one of the best recruiting packages in the industry that we acquired few years ago and now have built into our package in integrated single database kind of thing. So I think we\u2019re pretty solid on product, might be something there, but we\u2019re very solid on the full suite of products and now it\u2019s expanding into other things that I guess either adding more client base. So that's payroll companies, PEOs, etcetera, it\u2019s adding more and maybe a little bit of an off-suite of that, but not too far. So it goes small to large, it\u2019s not as much product as it is, I think expanding our market share and maybe going off a little bit different than what we are, but not too much. Efrain Rivera : Yes. And just to build on what Marty said, so we typically have done smaller tuck-ins. Our largest acquisition certainly in past five years was Sure and that was a little bit over $100 million. So when we say large, we\u2019re not talking about transformational opportunities. We\u2019re certainly looking at opportunities that are in the hundreds of millions of dollars, but not transformational and there is a wide range of assets on the market that are of interest to us that are forward in that range. Phil Stiller : Would you guys consider taking on debt to fund an acquisition or is that off the table? Efrain Rivera : We\u2019ve addressed that. The answer is that if it was the right opportunity, we would consider it. So that's not off the table. We haven't seen too many of those. There have been some that were of interest to us. But again one of the things that investors should expect when they invest in Paychex is we're not going to grow -- buy things to grow the company in that way, we think we have a pretty solid business model with good organic growth characteristics. And we think there are some assets out there that are of value they can help, but our strategy isn\u2019t to grow by acquisition. Our strategy is to buy things and grow then. Phil Stiller : Great. Makes sense Thanks guys. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Any more questions Operator : There are no more questions sir Martin Mucci : All right. Thank you, At this point, we'll close the call. We're very proud of the team at Paychex and our first quarter results. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived until October 30 and just a reminder, our Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held October 14 at 10 :00 AM here in Rochester. That meeting will also be broadcast over the internet. Thank you again for taking the time to participate in our first quarter press release, conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. And it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to, Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Sir you may begin. Martin Mucci : Thank you, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings release call and webcast. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2015. Our Form 10-Q, which provides additional discussions and analysis for the results of the quarter will be available in the next few days, our earnings release and 10-Q will be available on our investor relations page at Paychex.com. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our web site for approximately one month. On today's call, I will review highlights for the second quarter related to sales operations and product development. Efrain will review our second quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance. And then we\u2019ll open it up for your questions or discussion. We made good progress across all major product lines during the second quarter. Compared to second quarter of last year, payroll revenue advanced 4% as a result of growth in client base and revenue per check. HRS revenue grew at double-digit rates in the second quarter once again led by our success in selling HR outsourcing solutions to our clients, and total service revenue grew 7%. We continued to experience solid results and momentum across our sales organization with double-digit growth in revenue sold compared to last year. Our team\u2019s selling approach continues to produce results by introducing the full suite of products that Paychex can offer our clients upfront. We are encouraged by this momentum as we enter our main selling season right now. Our execution and service operations also continues to be excellent as demonstrated by client satisfaction results and retention level that remain consistent with recent highs. The employees in our service organization have done a great job as we move to more flexible service options with Paychex Flex including the 7/24 service. We expanded our human capital management product suite again with the recent launch of our integrated Paychex Flex Time and Paychex Flex benefits administration modules, these are two of the newest modules for cloud based HCM platform. Paychex Flex Time is a market leading time and attendance cloud-based solution, provides real-time data access and is designed to be exceptionally easy and intuitive to use for our clients, it gives employers unprecedented visibility and control over labor scheduling, tracking, and reporting. Paychex Flex benefits administration provides employers with a robust customizable system built to improve employee productivity, communication, and decision-making and allowing complete oversight and control of employee information effectively to manage our company's benefit plans. We also have best-in-market mobility offerings in our opinion for both administrative users and employee self-service that allow access to our HCM suite from a single mobile application. We continue to receive positive reviews for our Flex platform that we\u2019re very proud of as evidenced by our recognition from the Brandon Hall Group excellence awards for an advancement in workforce management technology for small and midsize businesses and PC Magazine's recent review referring to Paychex Flex as excellent and calling it more robust and scalable than many of the competitors\u2019 platforms they reviewed. Turning to the Affordable Care Act, last fiscal year, we launched our Paychex employer shared responsibility service to assist clients navigating the healthcare reform. Our ESR product includes monthly monitoring with automatic alerts as well as year-end reporting, and we are pleased with the continued level of client acceptance that we have experienced. We have increased our implementation and support spending to address the increased demand that we\u2019ve received for ESR. I appreciate the great hard work and dedication of this ESR team helping our clients through this first year of complex ACA requirements. Our Paychex insurance agency was named as the business insurance magazine\u2019s list of best places, the work and insurance for the very first time. This is a notable recognition, and I am very proud of the agency employees and the growth we've seen in the insurance business. On December 2, we announced our planned acquisition of Advanced Partners based just outside of Cleveland Ohio. We are enthusiastic about the opportunity Advanced Partners present and the experience and successful leadership team that will be joining Paychex. They offer customizable solutions to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding and outsourcing services that include payroll processing, administration, and invoicing. The staffing outsourcing business is a growing industry that serves many small and midsize staffing firms, which is an ideal fit for us at Paychex. Also given Paychex's extensive product suite, financial strength, and access to capital, we can help expand advanced partner\u2019s product offering and accelerate its growth. This acquisition will close shortly. We remain committed to adding additional value for our shareholders with our dividend at $0.42 per share.  We maintain a strong dividend yield, one of the highest in the industry. The Paychex stock repurchase program remains in place and we have acquired over a million shares of common stock in the first six months of fiscal 2016. And in summary, I am very pleased with the continued strong execution of our sales and service teams, our product strength, and financial performance, and I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employee team. I will now turn on the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks Marty and good morning to you all. I just want to remind everyone that during today\u2019s conference call we will make some forward looking statements that refer to future events and thus involve risk referred to the usual disclosures. As Marty indicated, second quarter financial results for fiscal 2016 represented a continuation of the solid start we had to the year.  I\u2019ll cover the highlights and provide greater detail in certain areas and then wrap with the review of our 2016 outlook. I\u2019ll add some comments on second half guidance, so as I get mid way through my comments you will start to hear those. Total revenue grew 7% for the second quarter, 8% for the six months to $722 million and $1.4 billion respectively.  Total service revenue also grew 7% for the second quarter and 8% for the six months to $711 million and $1.4 billion. Interest on funds held for clients increased 8% for the second quarter and 7% for the six months to $11 million and $22 million respectively. These changes were driven by higher average in best interest rates I should say, and higher average investment balances. Expenses increased 5% for the second quarter and 6% for the six months, primarily in compensation related costs and strong growth in the PEO. The increase in compensation related costs was driven by higher wages and performance based compensation costs. Operating income net of certain items increased 9% for the second quarter and 10% for the six months at $283 million and $568 million respectively. We maintained strong operating margins of 40%, but anticipate that our full year will remain within our guidance of approximately 38%. The second half of the fiscal year consistent with prior years is expected to result in lower margins, primarily due to higher selling and operations costs, which are variable and more detail on that later. Net income increased 9% to $189 million for the second quarter and 16% to $398 million for the six months. Diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $0.52 per share for the second quarter and 17% to $1.10 per share for the six months. The six-month period was positively impacted by the net tax benefit related to prior year revenues that was recognized in the first quarter. When we exclude this impact, net income and diluted earnings per share would have risen 10% and 12% respectively. Let us turn to payroll revenue. Payroll service revenue increased 4% for both the second quarter and six months to $427 million and $860 million respectively. We benefited from increases in client base and revenue per check. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increase net of discounting. Checks per client really didn't benefit payroll revenue. HRS revenue increased 11% to $284 million for the second quarter and 13% to $564 million for the six months. This increase reflects strong growth in both clients and worksite employees at Paychex HR services, which includes our ASO and PEO products. Insurance services benefited from continued growth of our ESR product that assists clients with healthcare reform and an increase in health and benefits applicants together with higher average premiums and clients in our workers comp insurance product. Our HR administration and time and attendance products contributed to the growth through robust sales with these solutions. Retirement services revenue benefited from growth in a number of plans and an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of participant funds, retirement services revenue growth was all set by pricing impacts in the respective prior year period. Let\u2019s look at investments and income. Our goal as you know is to protect principle and optimize liquidity. On the short term side, primary short-term investment vehicles were bank demanded positive accounts, high-quality commercial paper and variable rate demand notes. In our longer term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality in municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. Government Securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.7% and an average duration of approximately 3.3 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average return of 1.1% for both the second quarter and the six months. On December 6, 2016 as you all are aware the Fed raised federal funds range by 25 basis points. The first interest rate hike in nearly a decade. We expect the impact for the balance of the fiscal year will be modest. Let\u2019s take a look at our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $930 million. Funds held for clients as of November 30, 2015 were $3.7 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and they average $3.7 billion for the quarter and $3.8 billion for the six months. Out total available for sale INVESTMENTS including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $34 million as of November 30, compared with net unrealized gains of $14 million as of May. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $1.9 billion, reflecting $304 million in dividends paid during the six months and $63 million of common shares repurchased. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 39%. Cash flows from operations were $420 million for the first six months or 4% increase from the prior year. This change was a result of higher net income on cash flow from operations offset by fluctuations in working capital. The fluctuations in our working capital between periods were primarily related to the timing of collections from clients and payments for compensation, PEO payroll, and income taxes. Now I\u2019d like to turn to fiscal 2016 guidance. Let me remind you first that our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions and net guidance for the full-year is unchanged from the previous quarter. I will reiterate our full year ranges and then give some color on the back half of the year. Payroll service revenue anticipated to remain in the range of 4% to 5%, HRS in the range of 10% to 13%, total service revenue in the range of 7% to 8%, and net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 8% to 9%. Please note that the range excludes the benefit of the net tax benefit we recorded in the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the year, excluding the impact of the net tax benefit discussed above will be approximately 36%. Our interest on funds held for client and operating margin are expected to be consistent with prior guidance. Now, current guidance doesn't include the announcement by the fed of about 25 basis point change in rates. This is going to equate to approximately $1 million after tax for the remainder of this fiscal year. On the call, I will talk a little bit about why it may be more modest than you assume, but I would just say to preface that conversation that much of that impact won't be start to be felt until January and then it will be modest. Our guidance also does not include any expectation of future increases. We don\u2019t look at forward rates to determine what guidance should be, we simply make an assumption once the fed is active. There obviously is a chance that the fed will continue to raise. We will update guidance when that happens. Full year guidance, currently excludes the impact of the advanced partners acquisition that Marty referenced earlier and which we expect to close shortly. It is not expected to impact earnings in the current fiscal year, meaning it will not be dilutive in this year, neither will it be accretive in the balance of the fiscal year. I\u2019ll describe separately the impact of advance shortly. So, while it isn\u2019t our typical practice to provide specific guidance on quarters, we do want to be as transparent as possible and provide you with some color on third and fourth quarter this year. Payroll revenue growth for the third quarter is anticipated to be at the lower end of the guidance range. While payroll revenue growth in the fourth quarter, we anticipate to be at the higher end of the range. As we stated in previous calls, the fourth quarter will benefit from one additional processing day this year. This was the case in the first quarter, as you all remember. HRS revenue growth for the third quarter is anticipated to fall below the low end of the full year guidance range as we indicated in previous calls. I call that out and when we started the year. This is a result of strong third quarter and the prior year resulting from very strong PEO performance and we had benefited from pricing in our retirement services businesses, while both are doing fine. They just simply don\u2019t - are not as strong as they were in the prior year. For the fourth quarter, we expect HRS revenue growth will be within the full year range. In addition, we anticipate, as is typically the case, higher selling expenses in the second half of the year, but this year given the strength of our sales performance in the first six months of the year, we believe that selling expense will be higher than we had planned. We also anticipate higher operations expense due to stronger sales that I just mentioned and also very, very strong demand for our ACA compliance solutions. So, you will feel much of that in the third quarter. Again, current year guidance is not changed. So, as I just mentioned the guidance that I discussed doesn\u2019t include any impact from advanced partners. So, when we close this is what we anticipate. For the balance of the year, we believe that the acquisition will contribute approximately 1% to payroll revenue growth and approximately 1.5% to HRS revenue growth. That\u2019s in the balance of the year, second half. That impact will be, primarily will be split more towards the fourth quarter then the third quarter because we anticipate that will only recognize two months of revenue in Q3. So, the waiting will be a little bit more towards the fourth quarter. And we anticipate that additional expenses, operating expense from the acquisition will offset revenue in the balance of this year, won\u2019t be dilutive, won\u2019t be accretive, will essentially be neutral. So, I hope that was clear and with that I\u2019m going to turn it back to Marty for questions. Martin Mucci : Thanks Efrain. At this point, we will now open the call to your questions or comments. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies, your line is open. Jason Kupferberg : Hi good morning guys, happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Same to you. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks. Thanks. I wanted to start with a question on share buyback, I don\u2019t think you guys repurchased any shares in the quarter and I believe you\u2019ve got about 100 million left on the authorization. So, wanted to just get a sense of whether that was because you see some additional M&A opportunities at size in the pipeline beyond advanced partners or did you just find the price of the stock not attractive enough or any other factors at work there? Efrain Rivera : Hey Jason that\u2019s a good question, I think I would get it bad upside the head if I said the stock price wasn\u2019t attractive. Jason Kupferberg : [You are] very, very honest with us Efrain. Efrain Rivera : Yes, I try to. We purchase opportunistically, so that\u2019s part of what our plan is. You know on the M&A front, I think there is an element of that advance was a nice acquisition, but I would say as I had been saying now for a number of months and finally we have some evidence of this, the pipeline is robust. So, we see a lot of opportunities for M&A in spaces we like at prices we like. So, I think it\u2019s a combination of all those factors. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. And so just as a follow-up, I guess as a two part question, as we go into that key year end selling season, how do you feel you are set up with the product set, sales force capability, should we expect a double digit sales growth that you\u2019ve been seeing to continue, and then just along with that any macro comments about new business creation and general hiring trends that you would like to share? Martin Mucci : Yes, this is Marty Jason. I think we\u2019re feeling very good. We\u2019ve got great sales momentum. It has continued Q1 and Q2 double-digit par growth, and we would expect that to continue. This is a really important quarter obviously for us from a sales perspective, but we\u2019re going in with great momentum, and in particular in the mid market, very strong in the mid market and this is something that the product development work and the technology has been so important for Flex, and we\u2019re really seeing that payoff now. We\u2019re really seeing very strong results on the mid market, even as competition is out there pretty consistently and we\u2019ve talked about that, we\u2019re really seeing very positive results from a growth perspective in what\u2019s sold. So, we\u2019re going and feeling good about it. We feel like the product work that we\u2019ve done and some of it here this last quarter is when we introduced really the fully integrated time and attendance and a benefitted administration into Flex, positions us extremely well for this selling season and frankly ongoing future quarters. Jason Kupferberg : And just the new business creation and small business hiring? Martin Mucci : New business - yes, I am sorry, yes in fact our sales from new businesses is up, quite a bit stronger than last year, so while the small business index would say that it is pretty consistent from an employment growth, I would say sales to new businesses are up a bit. So, we are feeling pretty good about that. I wouldn\u2019t say it is a huge surge, but it is certainly consistent and up a few points from last year at this time. So, I think that\u2019s very positive. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, I appreciate it. Have a good holiday. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley, your line is open. Danyal Hussain : Hi good morning Marty and Efrain. Thanks for taking my questions. Efrain Rivera : Hi, Dan. Danyal Hussain : Just high level one about Advance Partners and understanding it hasn\u2019t closed yet, but when we are looking out to fiscal 2017 and beyond, can you just give us a sense for what is the sort of margin profile looks like whether it is, if it tucks right in whether we can expect it to be further in line with the company average? Efrain Rivera : Well this is a good question, as you know it was interesting about advance, now I\u2019m going to exclude purchase accounting because that will obviously impact it, but if you look at it from an EBITDA margin, what was really unusual about the business was it was pretty comparable to where Paychex was which is saying something. I mean we look at lot of acquisitions, we run into very few that have very solid growth, very solid margins. They\u2019ve built a great business, not a flash in the pant, they\u2019ve been at it for almost 20 years with the strong track record of growth. Martin Mucci : Yes. We feel, obviously very good about the opportunity as well. So, not only is it a good margin business, but as Efrain said, the leadership team there is staying with us and being part of Paychex and they\u2019ve built it over time I think very carefully and very strategically and certainly very profitably. So, we think it\u2019s going to fit in extremely well, and we think that with our access to capital and product, we\u2019ll be able to accelerate in distribution. We\u2019re going to be able to accelerate their growth even more. Danyal Hussain : Got it thanks, and then just a question on Flex, so I think Efrain you mentioned in the past that Flex constitutes the majority of new sales, but you\u2019re not mandating client migration over the Flex, is there a point where you can eventually stop offering some of the core products and really push the Flex product more to new sales, and then looking a couple of years from now, is there a reasonable timetable for when you expect majority of clients will have ruled over and then what impact you might see from a retention of margins? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think - at this point, we are not forcing it. I think we are doing it the way we had hoped, which is, this is attracting new clients and accelerating those sales by the way to new clients and it\u2019s attracting current clients to come over. So, we\u2019re presenting that if you want -- you have certain needs from the product that if you want to migrate over you can, we\u2019re not pushing that too hard yet and we\u2019re not necessarily putting it kind of a drop dead date on migrations. It\u2019s always better to be on the newest platform, but frankly the existing platform is satisfying a lot of needs for existing clients and many of them don\u2019t like to move. So, I think that\u2019s - we don\u2019t have a certain date, but we are going to handle it kind of carefully and we are going let the clients at this point do probably most of the moment and we\u2019re feeling good about that. Certainly the new sales, the majority, particularly in the mid-market are all on Flex and that\u2019s going extremely well. Efrain Rivera : The other thing I would add Daniel is just to put it in context, if I exclude sure and frankly if I include it doesn\u2019t really change what I\u2019m about to say 90+ percent of our clients are on either Flex or on Sure\u2019s platform, which frankly is the hybrid of core Advance and their own platform. So it\u2019s not a huge part of the base, obviously we are selling primarily midmarket clients on the new platform, yes. Danyal Hussain : Got it, and then maybe a quick modeling question if I could, you mentioned retirement services impacted the growth rate I guess over the trailing four quarters. Could you just quantify that? Martin Mucci : I didn\u2019t catch the first part, if I was \u2026 Danyal Hussain : The retirement services, you I think change pricing, [indiscernible]\u2026 Martin Mucci : Yes, yes, it\u2019s just, that\u2019s basically what's causing the growth rate to drop a bit in addition to PEO, I won\u2019t quantify it any more than that, but we periodically take pricing in different segments of the business. HRS is a little different than Payroll where, Payroll it\u2019s pretty typical every year, HRS we look at different products and try to gauge where market has decided to take some of those actions last year and didn\u2019t repeat this year. Danyal Hussain : Perfect. Thank you. Martin Mucci : You\u2019re welcome. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from S.K. Prasad Borra of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. S.K. Prasad Borra : Thanks for taking my questions, Marty if you could just [indiscernible] as you are heading to the selling season this quarter. How is the balance in comparison to last year? Can you share any insights on the [indiscernible] Martin Mucci : So, S.K if I heard your question, sorry I know you\u2019re traveling, the question was set up for the selling season, compared to last year how we feel about that was that what you asked? S.K. Prasad Borra : Exactly that. Martin Mucci : Okay yes, sorry just couldn\u2019t make it out. The - I feel very good about. I mean when you\u2019re carrying the kind of momentum, the good thing about selling season when you're heading into it is, how did you kind of start the year and particularly Q2 for that\u2019s kind of the beginning of it as you get into October and November is very good. So when you\u2019re seeing double-digit growth in par we had an increase in sales reps, but it was pretty small single-digit kind of increase that we normally have. To see double-digit and what we\u2019re selling in the par revenue that we\u2019re selling consistently in Q1 and Q2 we feel good about Q3. And about the selling season now you never know till you are kind of through January, but we feel very good about it, we got full product suite. We got full onboard of reps of sales reps, we got very consistent driving leadership that\u2019s there. So, everything is very favorable for what we feel will be a very good selling season, great momentum going in. S.K. Prasad Borra : Thanks Martin and next one probably on capital allocation, you talked about the pricing and pipeline [indiscernible] now more it looks like you do more M&A compared to say terms like special dividend? Efrain Rivera : I don\u2019t know if more M&A it was always difficult to talk about a pipeline that no one saw except me, or Marty and I, but I think I would say the margin I wouldn\u2019t say will be on an accretive or in acquisition tier here. But I said the margin we have more things lined up closer to being executed than we have in the past. So, you\u2019ll see it, now just before that gets misinterpreted they\u2019re primarily tuck-in, I would say that that advance is a good example of the kinds of things that we\u2019re looking at we\u2019re not looking at large scale transformative M&A. But there are better opportunities out there and we\u2019re looking at opportunities to fill out what products set and tuck-in to existing businesses. S.K. Prasad Borra : Okay, the last one was obviously large debate on topic around the fee and what kind of margin [indiscernible] larger solutions. Can you just from your view point what are the margins such if you are producing is it actually margin in the long-term, do you have to take a hit on the near-term? Efrain Rivera : Yes, this is the perennial question. I think S.K. look we try to balance it, obviously if we can get much faster growth and sacrifice a little bit of margin, we\u2019d look at that. But the life doesn\u2019t present those need dichotomies, a lot of what we look at is are acquisitions that we think at least won\u2019t be dilutive to our margins when we run across businesses that that we think have good growth prospects and I point to Payroll as an example of that where when we initially bought it was dilutive to margins and now it\u2019s catching up to our margins. If we have a chance to improve the margins then we\u2019ll take a bit onto to get something that will improve growth and help us to improve and we could improve the margins over time. S.K. Prasad Borra : And then I just I was asking question on [indiscernible] and the margins you\u2019re getting from those solutions? Efrain Rivera : We\u2019re just getting from mid-cap partners. Yes I\u2019d just say if I heard your question correctly that they\u2019re on an EBITDA basis pretty close to Paychex corporate margins. S.K. Prasad Borra : Thanks Marty. Thanks Efrain. Happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Okay, thanks. Efrain Rivera : Thanks, same to you. Operator : Our next question comes David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : [Rina Kumar] : A - Martin Mucci Hi Rina[ph]. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, could you just walk us through the largest drivers to your 80 basis points operating margin expansion this quarter? Martin Mucci : This quarter, I would say lot of that was just primarily driven by a lower operating expense in the quarter. So we went into the quarter with a certain expectation around what we needed in terms of operating expenses came out a bit a little bit later than we anticipated that\u2019s really the primary driver. Unidentified Analyst : Got it, could you quantify net price increases are you realizing in both Payroll and HR services this year? Martin Mucci : I won't go any further than calling out what we typically say that on payroll we\u2019re getting 2% to 4% price increase where you can assume that\u2019s in that range. We don\u2019t typically call out HRS, because it varies year-to-year. So, we\u2019re getting some price increase it\u2019s not certainly as good as I mentioned on a call as what we got last year. The other thing I would say to Rina is, one of the things that\u2019s occurring, particularly on the Payroll side is with the sales force able to sell more full-featured packages, especially under 50 you get some mix benefit too. So all of those things help our revenue per client picture. Unidentified Analyst : Understood. Thank you and happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Kartik Mehta : Hey Marty. Hey Efrain. Martin Mucci : Hi Karthik. Kartik Mehta : Hey Efrain you talk a little bit about Advanced Partners, is this an acquisition or an industry that you think you have to build scale to really benefit from this, or is this, you would like to see what you have and then determine if you want to take the next step. But further consolidating? Martin Mucci : I think if you mean by consolidating acquiring more I think, I mean we feel good this was a really good fit for us. As Efrain mentioned we had a big pipeline that we look at and that we look at this company here they are outsourcing support Payroll fund and funding support to small and midsize staffing companies like 7,500 staffing companies placing 200,000 times a year. This is a nice business that there's a number of - there's a few businesses that do this, but nobody as much I think to this scale and have done it very thoughtfully over the years. I think as we look at the business we've got clients with staffing companies that I think are great opportunities for the funding side of the business for them and I think we've got a lot of products that we could offer to their clients I think this is a good fit we\u2019re going to see how this goes, but we\u2019re always looking to say hey if it make sense both from our standpoint and from theirs as well from their leadership. I think there maybe some count consolidation efforts that are available out there. Kartik Mehta : Marty, I know this is a fairly small acquisition, compared to the overall Paychex, does this change the risk profile is this acquisition change or risk profile of the acquisitions you\u2019ve looked at and - compared to the acquisitions you\u2019ve looked at in the past? Martin Mucci : I don\u2019t think so, I think we\u2019re always looking for, as Efrain said this has got a good strong margin to it that's close to ours it's got a nice solid growth. I don't think it really changes the risk profile much, I think one of the great things that they did frankly was had very good risk policies and procedures to be sure. This is a bit of a trickier business to be sure you're handling the right risk and you\u2019re taking on the right risk and they just done a done a remarkable job. And I think with our risk team, our risk management team working with them I think we can help that even more with more tools and more information. So I don\u2019t think it really changes the risk profile at all. Kartik Mehta : And then Efrain, on the flow portfolio, one, any changes you\u2019re going to make as it seems though the Fed is probably going to continue increasing rates, and two is that, 25 basis points about $2 million to net income, is that the right way to look at it on an annual basis or is there something different this time around that might mute the increase you would get in net income from rate increases? Efrain Rivera : Okay, two good questions. So Kartik the simple answer is that it depends on the shape of the yield curve and if the yield curve steepens then you have one portfolio strategy approach and if the yield curve stays relatively flat you have another. So we look at that in the spring so that\u2019s why I can\u2019t say definitively, hey, this is what it look like in 2017. In addition I would like to see if the Fed does do something in the spring. It will certainly aid the portfolio, just the question is how much and how we configure the portfolio. On the $2 million, I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s far off Kartik. The only trick and the reason why I call out $1 million is that, number one, we don\u2019t really expect to see too much benefit except through, I\u2019m sorry until sometime in January. It\u2019s not the best timing because our balances increase significantly in December and beginning of January by that time we\u2019ll be passed the peak of our balance. So we don\u2019t get quite as much by the time you\u2019re talking February before we start to see a lot of the - some of the benefits you don\u2019t have that many months left in the year. So that\u2019s part of what\u2019s guiding. And the final thing I would say is that if you\u2019re looking at for example money market rates and what banks are doing, the effects of the interest rate increase are really slow rolling. They will eventually get there but it\u2019s kind of a slow role at this point. Kartik Mehta : Yes, thanks, Efrain, I really appreciate it. Efrain Rivera : Yes, you\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Gary Bisbee : Hi, guys. Good morning. Martin Mucci : Hi, Gary. Efrain Rivera : Good morning. Gary Bisbee : Just following up on that last one on rates, so did I hear you right you are not including in the guidance the $1 million benefit you think you will get from the Fed hike and if I did hear that right why not? Efrain Rivera : No, I guess what I was trying to say was that, it doesn\u2019t alter the guidance significantly. I am calling it out, it\u2019s about $1 million. It just doesn\u2019t change significantly where we are at in terms of the guidance on interest rates. Gary Bisbee : Gotcha. Okay. And I know you don\u2019t assume any future increases. Efrain Rivera : Right. Gary Bisbee : But if - in the guidance, but if the Fed did view what the Fed folks say which is in next calendar year at 1.375%, I understand that it depends on the shape of the yield curve but you do have about half the float in overnight stuff that we value pretty quickly. So we can start to see that really benefit if they do go through with that. Efrain Rivera : Hey, look, you\u2019re right Gary, that\u2019s absolutely right. I\u2019m not trying to be excessively conservative. I obviously I\u2019m somewhat gun sighted and tell people we think that that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going to happen. And I\u2019ll tell you I\u2019ll be the happiest person around if that\u2019s where we end up. I\u2019m extremely hopeful but you\u2019re right that\u2019s exactly what would happen that would ripple through those short term portfolio and have a pretty significant impact on stock. Gary Bisbee : Okay, good. I think the way you do it makes sense. And then just one question on ACA driven demand, I know in the last few years, HRS has been real strong as you\u2019ve had a broad halo effect, more customers are interesting in considering their options in Europe trusted source they turn to. But is - should we think of the ACA compliance offering as having been a significant part of bookings and something that could drive some real acceleration in calendar 2016 or should we think because I know ADP\u2019s talk that way [indiscernible] even with their ACA compliance have seen just massive bookings growth or should we think that within the broader HRS portfolio it\u2019s certainly a positive factor but just one of many and more steady as she goes continued strong growth. Martin Mucci : I think I would say steady if she goes on HRS growth. I think it certainly is helping. It still remains to be seen after the first filing day where clients fall out and are they going to stay with it, are more clients going to come in. I think some will fall out that probably we\u2019ll say, hey, I didn\u2019t need it and I think others will say I should have had it and we will add. So I think we\u2019ll still have good sales with ESR, the ACA product through 2016 kind of calendar year because I think some things will fall out, I think some clients will fall out and realize they should have had the product and then didn\u2019t file because we\u2019re already getting calls like that now like, hey what do I do and it\u2019s a little bit late to gather all that information. So I think it\u2019s a little bit early but it\u2019s very positive. We\u2019ve seen great acceptance of the product and frankly as we mentioned in the prepared comments, we\u2019ve had to ramp up some cost in the quarter just to kind of handle all of the inflow of data and everything the clients are giving us. So I think it will still be a positive right through the calendar year. Gary Bisbee : Great. And then just one quick one, as you add on these incremental components to the Flex offering, should we think of it as an material revenue opportunity to have existing customers turn those on or is there more of a sales effort that will take some time to drive that incremental revenue as you add these important components. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Sure. I think it will take a little bit of time. I think we kind of make sure that we\u2019re bringing the clients along carefully. We are paying close attention now. The operations team and the client retention teams talking to those clients realize a net benefit than we make the sale of the additional products and turn on those additional modules. The biggest benefit is when you\u2019re selling the entire product combined to the new clients but we\u2019re certainly going back and marketing to the base that you now have available more modules that you can turn on. So I think there is certainly an opportunity there but we\u2019re not going to rush it and blitz the base. We are letting the clients, did comfortable with Flex and then show them that there is additional modules which will help not only sales but retention, more importantly as well. Gary Bisbee : Great. Thank you. Happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Thank you too. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim MacDonald of First Analysis. Your line is now open. Jim MacDonald : Yes, good morning, guys. Martin Mucci : Morning. Jim MacDonald : A couple of follow-ups. Advance partners you talked about 1.5% increase in the HRS side from that eventually, what categories is that and are those categories new to you like the financing? Efrain Rivera : Yes. That\u2019s primarily the financing part of the business. So it would be HRS then we\u2019ll have to figure out longer term kind of where it goes. The other part just to anticipate a question someone will ask, the other part is payroll services. The business is split pretty evenly between the two. Jim MacDonald : Okay. And Martin mentioned that MMS is growing strongly now. Besides the obvious competitors is that coming from any other sources, expansion of the market or just where you think that\u2019s coming from? Martin Mucci : I think there is some expansion and the fact that as we\u2019ve talked about the need for the total product set has come down. So I think there is more clients in that 50 plus, maybe 50 to 150 employees that are needing more product and more services and they are out. They may have been on an in-house solution and that was much more simple and they needed more, they needed time and attendance, they needed HR administration, they needed benefits administration. So I think that I do think the market is expanding a bit in the fact that who needs the complete suite of services which has been positive, but also think obviously we are taking share from some competitors as well. Even though there is more competitors out there and talking about things, I think we\u2019ve seen little bit more share we are taking now as we have a complete product at HCM suite of cloud based SaaS services. Jim MacDonald : Great. Happy holidays guys. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Jim. Take care. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim McHugh from William Blair Company. Your line is now open. Tim McHugh : Yes, thanks guys. Just wanted to clarify a couple of things. I guess the comments on advanced - that revenue contribution of 1 point to payroll 1.5 point to HRS, that\u2019s for the six months left in the fiscal year, is that the right way to think about it? Efrain Rivera : That\u2019s correct, Tim. Tim McHugh : But you will only have it for five. So if we are thinking about the quarterly run rate it\u2019s quarterly contribution, I guess full quarter it\u2019s higher than that. So\u2026 Martin Mucci : Yes, it would be, so yes assuming we close this month, which we in or like we would we\u2019ll do we expect to close shortly, yes you would have two months in Q3 and then three months in Q4. Tim McHugh : Okay did you quantify the size of the purchase price, I guess we\u2019ll see it in essentially\u2026 Martin Mucci : No you\u2019ll see it, you\u2019ll see it. Tim McHugh : Okay. And the comment about retirement about pricing I guess I was - I wasn\u2019t clear exactly is the comment just you\u2019re taking last price than you did a year ago so the growth rate is lower or is it? Martin Mucci : Yes that\u2019s a\u2026 Tim McHugh : Okay there wasn\u2019t a onetime bump last year that was a onetime revenue source I guess? Martin Mucci : No, we review pricing along all of our businesses and periodically in HRS in particular don\u2019t necessarily in a given year increased the price, but may increase it so\u2026 Tim McHugh : Did you see some sort of client pushback that\u2019s why you took didn\u2019t take price again this year? Martin Mucci : No we just, we try to figure out what, we do a lot of work on pricing to figure out what makes sense, so we don't end up having an attrition or retention problem. Tim McHugh : Okay. Thanks. Martin Mucci : Yes. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Rick Eskelsen : Hi good morning. Thank you for taking. Martin Mucci : Hi Rick. Rick Eskelsen : Hey how are you? Martin Mucci : Good. Rick Eskelsen : Thank you for taking my question happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Yes. Thanks. Rick Eskelsen : The first one just on the a minimum premium plan and the PEO, you\u2019ve had it in the place now for over year just wonder if you could sort of talk about the success that you\u2019ve seen there if you only to plan to extend it further and then any impact on the risk in the PEO book? Martin Mucci : I think, now we\u2019ve done a good job on the risk is we handle it very carefully and I think the sales and the risk management team there that worked very well together, which is what we expect and they\u2019ve done a good job. Things went very successful, I think it\u2019s fairly limited to the area, but it's done well and I think we\u2019re always looking at ways to expand it if that opportunity presents itself and so we\u2019re very open to doing that. Rick Eskelsen : Thanks and then just pulling up, wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the margins again, can you just remind us sort of what your investment plans are for areas like IT, I think you had talked about in the past, now it's sort of growing in line with revenue, is that the right? Martin Mucci : It took on a little faster than revenue, it probably will continue to grow a little bit faster than revenue, it just was growing at significantly higher than revenue growth. So, I think it's moderated a bit. But I think if you lead technology enabled services business tech spending is going to outpace revenue growth at least over the intermediate term that will do that for us and that\u2019s just the price of being in the business. And we have to we look at other ways to leverage the business to ensure that we deliver the bottom line. Rick Eskelsen : Okay and then just the last question just sort of philosophically here with the Advanced Partner\u2019s acquisition just wondering how much of it was interest in adding more capabilities and then the staffing market more in-line with the stuff that you already do and how much of it was getting some of the funding stuff so it sort of expanding your services. And in future acquisitions how much to either those two bulking up the existing verse expanding into new plan to it. Thanks. Martin Mucci : It\u2019s an interesting - I think it\u2019s a little bit of both. I mean always we\u2019re looking for to drive top line growth and continue to leverage and being a very profitable company it makes the M&A very tight the selection very tight and give it at a very valuable good value. So, I think it's a little bit of both I think we can expand what we saw was a great opportunity just as you said to take what their products are and expanded to a number of clients that we have that are staffing firm small to midsize staffing firms. And we think that's an immediate benefit and then also adding more, not only product to what they're offering, but the access to capital. This business needs capital, access to capital to be able to continue to grow the funding business and we certainly have that not only in cash, but in access to more capital besides. So, we think between the two of them we can accelerate their growth and therefore our growth and do it at a very profitable, a very profitable way to do it. So this was a perfect fit for us. And it\u2019s very much focused on that small to midsize staffing from which there's thousands 10,000 of them, and I think they had a very decent market share, but still a lot of room to grow. So very good and we think that temporary staffing business frankly is going to continue to grow we\u2019re seeing part-time employment is growing almost 3 percentage points in the last two years. So we think that with overtime rules ACA and a number of other requirements the staffing business and temporary employee business is going to continue to grow and we want to be part of it. Efrain Rivera : The gig economy is here to stay. Rick Eskelsen : Thank you very much. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jeff Silber : Thank you so much. Last week when Congress signed the year end budget build there were number of so called tax extenders that were extended over longer time periods than they usually are, I know one of your competitors went out trumpeting one of them specifically they want to see the work opportunity tax credit. Is that something you think would be an advantage to you or are there any other items that were in there that might be something to help us for business going forward. Thanks. Martin Mucci : I think just generally all those, they all encourage or they tend to encourage most of them investment new business startups and existing businesses to invest more in their business and to give some tax benefit for that. I think that's all positive all makes the economy stronger, I think the fact that those had expired I think would have dampen investment in particularly in small to midsize businesses. So, I think they\u2019re all positive. I don\u2019t think it was any one that would stand out to us to be that big of a benefit. But they certainly are all positive for the overall business environment. Jeff Silber : Okay that\u2019s helpful and Efrain I\u2019m apologizing in advanced, I\u2019ve got another interest rate question for you. Efrain Rivera : Well go ahead. Jeff Silber : You mentioned, I think you were going to be look at the strategy in the spring? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Jeff Silber : Is that because you\u2019re just doing planning for next year or you are anticipating interest rate increases coming in the spring? Efrain Rivera : I think it\u2019s both so Jeff, so how you can figure the portfolio not going to long digression here for you. But what ADP does is different than what we do. They borrow short-term, they invest long-term, we don't do that to a significant extent, we just haven't seen the value add in recent years to do that, but the shape of a yield curve really has a big impact on why do you do that or you don't do that. And so we\u2019re little bit and wait and see. We think our internal betting is that Fed will probably raise again in the spring and then it'll start to become a little bit more clear to us what the shape of that yield curve is going to be, so we can plan into 2017. So, it\u2019s a little bit above. Jeff Silber : Okay great. Thanks so much. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is now open. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thank you guys, good morning. Martin Mucci : Good morning. Ashwin Shirvaikar : So, I just want to start off with a clarification question with the guidance being what it is, it does include a few months of advance, it does include the modest impact of higher interest rates. What you're really saying is that neither of those factors taken together is enough to do to change your guidance profile, but they're still included in there? Efrain Rivera : That\u2019s correct Ashwin that\u2019s the point, so we could characterize it in a number of different ways. But the guidance ranges that we give even with all those changes at this point we don't anticipate significant change from what we said at the beginning of the year. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. And then conceptually as your sales force sells a wider range of products and include Advanced and there for example it\u2019s more complex offering that that makes sense in terms of revenue per client. But as you try to manage that what specifically is the forward risk profile associated with federal funding, which frankly is not a end market that I fully understand yet. And does that mean a need for more sales force training, more expense in that area? Efrain Rivera : Yes I think that one, Ashwin I think that it will be sold by a specific sales force, it may be referred and it very much will be referred by the broader sales force but that sale is very specific to and something that Advanced has done a very good job on is having highly trained sales reps who bring a proper risk client risk profile client to them then it goes through underwriting as well. So that's why I think they've done a very good job on a risk. So it won't have to - we won\u2019t have to train our entire sales force, we\u2019ll look for them, we\u2019ll train them on the opportunity and the product. But just to get the referral to the other - to a specific sales force that will evaluate the risk profile of the opportunity and then bring it to underwriting. Martin Mucci : The other thing Ashwin that that we liked about the business was that as I said, approximately half of what they sell are services that were very, very, very familiar with. So they are selling Payroll and Outsourcing services, but in a particular vertical, which happens to be these staffing firm. So, the profile really is not significantly different, other than the funding piece of that that we think they do exceptionally well. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it and I apologize if this was asked, but I had to hop off for just a brief bit, the pushout of certain elements of ACA and Cadillac tax specifically is that, I mean how are you thinking about that for your specific client base does it have an impact? Martin Mucci : I don't think that one has an impact very much on our small to midsize businesses, I don't think you usually, they won't normally run into that that issue. So, I don't think, it will it\u2019s, I do think it's going to be a very interesting still a year calendar year ahead of us in 2016 for the Affordable Care Act products right now, because I said, I did mention certainly that the demand has been very strong and in fact we've added some expense to support all that inflow of data from clients. And I think that the sales will kind of some clients may say hey after the filing date I don't always need this I don't need this product others will realize that they did need it and there will be another, kind of surge in sales I think in 2016. So I think the sales are still continue to be pretty strong in a calendar year 2016. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it, my last question really is and this is potentially a few months too early, but do worry about the interest rate sensitivity obviously higher interest rates good for you, but interest rate sensitivity of your client base I mean do they care as just looking at one of your share Payroll surveys, which applies to a piece of your - of your client base that 45% of clients don't care, but that means that 55% do care any thoughts there? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think first of all where new businesses small businesses and those who are starting up typically don't go through a bank for their credit anyway. So, I don't think they will be too impacted by a number of increases that until it gets much higher. So, I don't think we\u2019re going to see a big impact on small business to start. They usually use other funding sources and so forth. So, I don\u2019t think a big impact there. I think midsize businesses that are more capital intensive that need to borrow, we\u2019ll see some impact as the rates start to go up. But in the near future it's hard to anticipate that they\u2019re going to up enough to drive that much impact to them, Efrain. Efrain Rivera : Yes, I\u2019d agree. Martin Mucci : Okay. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Okay got it, happy holidays guys. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Yes, bye. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Bryan Keane : Hi guys, just a couple follow-up question have you guys started on using your balance sheet more to do small business lending? Martin Mucci : We\u2019ve thought about it. It\u2019s a pretty crowded space out there with a number of companies out there doing it and we have we continue to look at that as an opportunity we are - we have some partnership with this to credit and to do some referrals with them but we\u2019ve continue to look at the business as well. But it is a pretty crowded space these days. Bryan Keane : Hey, yes you guys just have pretty good access to financials, so you would have a pretty good idea of good and bad loan potential, so I thought it would be an interesting option? Martin Mucci : Yes, we have launched it. Bryan Keane : I just want to ask you about retention going into the big selling season. How do you guys feel of retention going forward coming into the selling season here? Martin Mucci : Yes pretty good so far at this point. We\u2019re feeling good when we talked earlier about a price increase and we held our price increase, we\u2019ve held the increase well and our retention has been near it\u2019s historic best. And so it\u2019s early, because you really get that best sense at the end of December and into January, but at this point we feel good about it, our retention is continuing to hold. Bryan Keane : Okay and then can you quantify you talked about sales growth be in double-digits and ahead a plan. Can you quantify how much ahead a plan that is? Martin Mucci : No, but it\u2019s strong. I would just say this Bryan, so I called out higher sales expense, because I typically don\u2019t do, because it\u2019s - we\u2019ve got a range and frankly the street can figure out what that range is. But I would say through the first six months when we where preparing for the call we had a discussion about whether to call it out, because some quarters you have better sales growth and you have than others. But given the strength of what we\u2019ve seen in the back six months and in our planning process we thought we had to add to selling expense, because they are up to a very strong start, so it's strong by our standards. Yes. Bryan Keane : Okay and then the common question we\u2019re going to get on that is how does that translate that strong sales, the double-digits into revenue growth, maybe you can just remind us Efrain best way to\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Yes, typically you\u2019re not seeing that sales growth probably for another 4 to 6 months going forward. So there is a bit of a lag some of it you see as soon as two to three months some of it a little bit longer cycle, because you have to set clients up. So you start to see that translating into 2017 sales. Bryan Keane : Okay great. That\u2019s all I had. Happy holidays. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Martin Mucci : You too. Operator : Our next question comes from Sara Gubins of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Sara Gubins : Hi, thank you. Martin Mucci : Hi Sara. Sara Gubins : Question first on ACA how the adoption of the compliance product trend during the second quarter, I guess I\u2019m wondering if you talk about being at about 50% adoption last quarter and that have been up from 25% to 33% in the prior quarter. So, I\u2019m wondering kind of what the penetration is looking like? Efrain Rivera : I think it\u2019s a little bit higher than that Sara, but not dramatically higher. We never thought that we\u2019d get a 100% adoption in the base, because there are other solutions out there. So, I think we\u2019re trending above certainly about 50%, but it's not a 100%. And we don't anticipate that it will be. Sara Gubins : Okay and then quick question on Advanced Partners, how cyclical has their business been in the past given the end market? Martin Mucci : Yes, not very, I mean obviously I guess this is counter currency, I haven\u2019t looked at where they were in 2008 or 2009, but they\u2019ve had a pretty steady track record of growth. You can argue that one thing take a downturn you actually have slightly increased demand for temporary versus full-time employees. So, but their growth patterns been a pretty steady that was one of the thing that we looked at. Sara Gubins : Okay maybe they\u2019re getting picture and maybe [indiscernible]? Efrain Rivera : It, I think yes it could. Sara Gubins : Okay and then can you talk about sales expense being higher, did you change the plan for sales headcount growth did you talked about 3% this fiscal year versus the 5% last year? Efrain Rivera : No, no. Yes no we didn\u2019t I mean whatever we said at the beginning of the year is still holding we\u2019re above in sales that\u2019s particularly on the Payroll side. So that's true, when we call out higher sales expense is not headcount, it\u2019s because our sales are variable and so if we anticipate that sales is going to have a good selling season, which is what we believe will happen and we rarely talk about it that way. We\u2019re little bit more cautious than we just bump expenses and so right now in this street models that I have seen in third quarter we\u2019re not taking into account that selling expense so. Sara Gubins : Okay great, thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Marcon of Baird. Your line is now open. Mark Marcon : Good morning Marty and Efrain. Happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Thanks. You too. Mark Marcon : So just a follow-up on that the sales expenses up not because of headcount, but because of better performance it takes about four to six months if it\u2019s up double-digit then what sort of incremental bump does that do to revenue relative to a steady state? Efrain Rivera : Yes, I guess Mark, I will go through the arithmetic, but I think the thing always to remember is that our retention averages about 86%. So, yield a little bit of it of effect this year and then you get the rest of it next year in order for you - when people ask this question, in order for you to start accelerating up to double-digit you\u2019d have to really have appeared a multi-year period of very strong sales performance. Now we hope we\u2019re somewhat on that trend, but you need more than one to make it occur. That's part A. Part B of the explanation, which is going to lead me to part C, part B is simply to say that sales is one component of the equation, obviously retention is the other component of the equation and how the pieces of that fit together we put together a plan tells me where sales growth is going to go. You have seen that in the last three years certainly even excluding the impacts of the minimum premium plan, we've seen revenue bump up because sales the leading indicator has been growing, so I see it as simply that I will have to get to 17 when I give you guidance, but I think we feel good. If we see this sales growth continuing through the year that's going to be a positive for next year. Mark Marcon : All other things being equal we should end up seeing total services revenue accelerate slightly at least? Efrain Rivera : I would say, if we continue with the strong performance, yes. Mark Marcon : Great and then how much - can you just remind us what the ACA ERS is adding in terms of revenue? Efrain Rivera : We don't disclose it. What's tricky about that is, if I were to give you a number I'd have to say also then that ESR cuts both ways in that it represents an opportunity for additional sales but it's also other sales we might not get because people are focused on selling it and there's tremendous amount of demand so it's buried in the HRS number and that's about as far as we will go. Mark Marcon : Okay, is all of Advanced on HRS? Efrain Rivera : No that's Mark, so I called out very carefully the balance of the year and I think Tim asked earlier, so I called out a 1% increase for the balance of the year on service revenue and 1.5% for HRS for the balance of the year as Tim mentioned earlier is about five months or so that we expect so no actually the business is evenly split between payroll services, what we would consider payroll services revenue and funding, which we're going to lump into HRS for now until we figure out where a better category is for it. Mark Marcon : Right and Advanced is growing double-digits? Efrain Rivera : Yes they\u2019re and strong profitable. Mark Marcon : And so the pipeline that you mentioned I mean how rare is it to see something that\u2019s reasonably priced growing at a decent rate and as profitable you are? Efrain Rivera : Well what we disclosed the cash flow you guys can determine how reasonable price is, but we thought it was a reasonable price for the prospects of the business. It is fairly rare, I would say that. Martin Mucci : Yes. Mark Marcon : Okay. Any thoughts with regards to sales headcount going next year how you\u2019re thinking about trending that? Martin Mucci : Yes, I would think party it would be consistent depending on which area and so forth we're getting into studying that now and we will actually after selling season, but I think we would continue to probably increase a little bit more. You may see a little bit more virtual because that's where we've seen the growth in last few years, but there's still field resources would continue to go up as well. Mark Marcon : Okay and then one last question just on the international front whether we're thinking about Germany or Brazil any updates there? Martin Mucci : Germany has continued to I think do well the client base is really getting up their performances so sales performance is good and retention is very good. So, I think we\u2019re doing well there and Brazil has just been slower than we expected a number of things have changed the economy is not as strong there\u2019s some political stuff going on in the legislation that we expected that would be more of a disruptor, which was requiring more electronic filing for small businesses, it\u2019s been delayed now for a couple years. We expect it still get done, but it\u2019s taking longer so that disruption to drive more Payroll from accounts into a third party has been slower much slower to happen than we expected. Efrain Rivera : As to the other thing Mark just to build on what Marty said we remained interested in building out the international portion of the business and M&A is also focused on looking at those opportunities too. Yes. Mark Marcon : Great, thank you. Happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Thanks you too Mark. Operator : Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is now open. Lisa Ellis : Hi good morning guys. A question, you've talked for a couple quarters now about the transition to this bundled selling approach out in the field. Can you give an idea within HRS pars a little bit the relative growth rates of the ancillary services and how they've been impacted by that bundled selling approach versus the ASO/PEO piece of HRS? Efrain Rivera : We don't really break it down to that level but it definitely has helped our attachment rate at the beginning of the sale. Our old approach was, we will sell payroll. This particularly the small businesses we will sell you payroll and then come back with different sales forces and this team selling now with the 20 employee or so size has really gone much better. It's still early in the process, but we're seeing nice results where the clients not only is it we're selling more of a complete bundle, but also the clients have a, they're happier because they weren't looking for just payroll. They were looking for more and we're being able to satisfy them the right way I think up front, but we don't really break it down much more than that. Anything you want to? Okay. Lisa Ellis : Okay second one is Flex related. I think you mentioned that that is appealing to more of a mid market client. Can you give an idea of what size of client you're seeing a new uptick in in terms of demand and I guess any other changes or differences you're noticing about Flex? Martin Mucci : First of all as Efrain said the majority of the clients are on Flex. What I should say is the mid market that 50 plus it's more interested the full bundle of the suite of complete suite of products, so Flex can be payroll only, it can be a complete bundle of services and we're seeing bigger uptake in the bundle for those probably even 20 and above because that need has come down, so I think it's just Time and Attendance for example. In the past, you'd be pretty good size necessarily in employee before you'd be interested Time and Attendance now with overtime rules Affordable Care Act, and also by the way the technology of Time and Attendance, there's just a much greater need for it. Clients want it. It's easier, you can do it on your mobile Approximately, now client employees can punch in and out on their phone. So, I think the need has driven down in size and the technology and our breadth of products and mobility has made it a lot easier for clients to incorporate it into their businesses. So, I think the impact there is that the majority of clients are on Flex and the 20 plus, 30 plus employee clients are taking much more of a full suite or some portion of that suite of products. Lisa Ellis : Okay terrific. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Grossman from Stifel Financial. Your line is now open. David Grossman : Hi thank you. I had a throughout four minute so if this should been answered we can take you to offline. But just had a couple of very quick follow-up\u2026 Martin Mucci : Yes. David Grossman : So the first is I think here commentary implies that your checks for client were relatively flat and can you remind us is that a function of where we are in the cycle, or is there something else driving that metric? Martin Mucci : Yes, so David if you'll look at our average client size, we're balancing around 17 or so and it's really nothing more than the fact that under 50, we were having a lot of more growth than we were in previous years and you have a tendency there that has a tendency to depress the number of checks per client. If I same-store it you're at somewhere between 0-1%, so because checks per client are not really a significant contributor, we really just don't call it out so that's basically the dynamic of what's occurring. As you grow that you tend to see that impact. David Grossman : Right, I guess I was just trying to reconcile that with your commentary about some of the growth momentum in your new bookings it\u2019s being driven by MMS and\u2026 Martin Mucci : Good point and I think that\u2019s a fair point. It\u2019s early in the cycle so it\u2019s in the end we were start skewing higher than you would see that pop up. But it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time before you start to see that. David Grossman : Right and then the second question I had was on HRS, I think I understand the impact of the retirement services pricing action. However, what if anything maybe going on in the underlying PEO business, just curious what the trends are in that business relative to where they\u2019ve been because they have been relatively strong, I think we can agree it so. Efrain Rivera : Yes, they are still very, very strong. So, just to remind you what is varied, or not varied, what\u2019s included in nature as, so you got insurance services, you got HR outsourcing, you have retirement services and you have actually online services and I will just remind everyone that when we had the Investor Day I said, we really need to kind of think about how we represent Payroll services going forward because it really doesn\u2019t capture the activity that\u2019s going on in that segment of revenue. Having said all of that PEO still is relatively small as a percentage of revenue for the company as a whole and even within HRS it\u2019s still certainly well south of 50%, but it is growing very, very rapidly, faster, much faster than HRS is growing as a whole. Martin Mucci : Yes. I think it is a very strong market for the product particularly with the Affordable Care Act and the need for HR, more HR because of the regulations and so forth. So, yes it continues to be very strong demand. David Grossman : Alright, so no. The takeaway there is no change in trajectory of that business despite the growth rate at category? Efrain Rivera : No, we feel pretty optimistic about that. David Grossman : Okay and then just one final question, I guess there have been several questions about the booking moment that you are reporting, can you help us, I mean you called out MMS as being a component of that moment, but is there anything else in there in terms of the mix whether it be a fully outsourced solution versus not, you said it was revenue per client going us with more modules being purchased but just curious if there is any kind of new trend emerging that maybe driving that network? Efrain Rivera : I think obviously employee share responsibility helps too. So that is part of the equation there, but if I look at all of the different sales forces and the products that they sell, the combined effect is really strong we don\u2019t have sales forces that - we don\u2019t have any that are performing under where we expect. So, we got a lot of cylinders hitting all at once. Martin Mucci : I think the mid market is the strongest if you look at that that\u2019s been the biggest strong and the PEO and the HR outsourcing have been particularly as Efrain has mentioned. So, I think overall though as we\u2019ve seen nice growth in all of the sales forces, nice par growth, but the leaders have been at this stage the mid market and they have - remember they have a much fuller product suite now and two components were just added, fully integrated and so they are selling much of higher revenue per client and their - its success is up. David Grossman : Great. Well congratulations and have a great holiday. Martin Mucci : Thanks David, you too. David Grossman : Very good. Operator : Our next question comes from Tian Jing Wang of JPMorgan, your line is now open. Tian Jing Wang : Hi thanks. Just wanted to ask on PEO demand as we cross into the new calendar year, any change in your thinking around level of demand in general for PEO? Martin Mucci : No, just continue to be strong and selling season will kind of tell the tale, but it continues to be very strong and frankly has picked up in some parts of the country where we\u2019ve added more reps where we were not selling as much PEO. So, I think the demand there is still good and looks sustainable. Tian Jing Wang : Okay good. Just one more. Just on the HRS side, I know you always sweat rounding and one number, I think you mentioned it was in the far below the 10% to 13% range, I mean are we talking about rounding to 9% kind of issue or is it going to be bit different from there? Efrain Rivera : Thanks Tian Jing for asking the question. Everyone is figuring out. So, yes we are going to anticipate somewhere in that 9% range. Tian Jing Wang : Okay, like I said I know. Efrain Rivera : No, sure question. Tian Jing Wang : Just wanted to make sure, have a safe end of the year guys, thank you. Efrain Rivera : Thanks Tian Jing. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer, your line is now open. Glenn Greene : Thank you and thanks for fitting me in. Just two questions and clarifications, the first one is on sort of the booking momentum commentary, you know if I recall the kind of the last couple of quarters have been strong as well, so is it, did we accelerate in terms of booking momentum is this more just sort of sustainable trends we have seen over the last few quarters, just sort of how you would characterise it? Martin Mucci : I think it is sustained, I think it is up a little stronger, particularly in the mid-market, but it sustained double digit for at least the last few quarters. So, I would say it is up a little bit, but it is certainly, you know and that is good thing it is not like it popped up one quarter and then it slowed down. We have seen some nice momentum going into the selling season here. Glenn Greene : Okay and then just to clarify Efrain on Advanced Partners, and you sort of in your prepared comments you said it was excluded from the guidance and I think in our response to questions that are included in guidance and maybe just a nuance, but maybe the answer is just that it doesn\u2019t move the needle enough, but I kind of just want to check my math that it is like 60 basis points to growth and a 120 basis points to the back half. Efrain Rivera : Yes Glenn. So, what I was trying to do was carefully parse two things, first tell you what growth looked like before I added in Advanced Partners right, so I talked about that and then after I did that, I said okay, after you have gotten that right because you got to get your models right than what will Advance include when it is closed? So that is when I said in the balance of the year whatever your models say based on what I guided you to you are going to get about 1% in the balance of the year for payroll service revenue growth and 1.5% for HRS growth in the balance of the year and was clarified that that\u2019s probably going to be about five months or so. So, I just was trying to say the overlay of Advance looks like that. When you put all that together with guidance we\u2019ve given for the year, we\u2019re still overall within the range of guidance that we provided for the year. Glenn Greene : Okay, and just a quick math on a full year run rate, is it something like $35 million of revenue, is that reasonable? Efrain Rivera : I see where your math works and I can\u2019t disagree with it. Glenn Greene : Okay great. Thanks a lot. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Martin Mucci : Okay, I think that\u2019s all the questions. At this point we will close the call. If you are interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be achieved until approximately January 22. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our second quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. We very much appreciate that. We wish you all very happy holiday season. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Take care. Operator : Thank you. And that concluded today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation, you may disconnect at this time.",

At that time, to ask a question, you can press star and number one and record your name when prompted. This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would like to introduce Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin. Martin Mucci : Thank you very much, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings release call and webcast. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 29, 2016. Our Form 10-Q, which provides additional discussions and analysis of the results will be available later today. Our earnings release and Form 10-Q will be available on our investor relations webpage. This teleconference is being broadcast over the internet and will be archived and available on our website for about one month. On today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll review the highlights of the third quarter related to sales and operations and product development. Efrain will review our third quarter financial results in more detail and discuss our full-year guidance, and then we\u2019ll open it up for any questions. Once again, we\u2019ve experienced growth across our major human capital management solutions during the third quarter. Our third quarter financial results reflected total service revenue growth of 7%, including 4% in payroll service revenue and continued double-digit growth in our HRS revenue. We experienced positive sales growth through the first nine months, including a strong selling season. We were particularly pleased with our results in the mid-market space. Our HR outsourcing services also continued to reflect strong growth.  Mark Bottini, our head of sales and his organization have done a terrific job working as a team to demonstrate to new clients the value of our full suite of products that they offer. Our sales force turnover is at its lower level in years, and we are already ramping up for additional reps to be fully staffed for the start of fiscal 2017.  Our service execution continues to excel, demonstrated by continuing high levels of client satisfaction and retention. We completed a successful calendar year-end and our employees continued providing great service as we have moved to even more flexible service options. Year-to-date, we are experiencing the best net client gains since the recession as a result of both positive and effective selling and solid retention results. In terms of product development, we continue to focus on enhancing the user experience and flexibility with Paychex Flex, our cloud-based human capital management platform. Paychex Flex delivers access to payroll, human resources and benefits information, creating a streamlined and integrated approach to workforce management.  Earlier this fiscal year, we launched new and integrated modules within the Flex platform. This included the addition of Paychex Flextime, Paychex Flex Benefits administration, and Paychex Flex Hiring, which includes paperless recruiting, screening and on-boarding. This integrated suite allows for a simpler user interface that is supported by an industry-leading service model. We are very proud of our Paychex Flex platform and we\u2019re pleased to be recognized for the value our technology brings to our clients. In addition to the recognition from the Brandon Hall Group and Gartner increasing our position on the Magic Quadrant earlier this year, PC Magazine recently recognized Paychex Flex as one of the best cloud-based payroll services for 2016. We are very proud of the increased recognition that Paychex software-as-a-service based products and service are experiencing, and we see this played out with solid sales and retention performance. Last fiscal year, we launched our Paychex Employer Share Responsibility service, which is our full-service Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as ACA, solution. Our ESR product includes a multi-monitoring service with automatic alerts as well as year-end reporting. Our revenue from this ACA solution has increased as we assist clients with their monitoring and year-end reporting requirements. As a result of the demand for this service, we have increased our implementation and support spending. On December 22, we completed the acquisition of Advance Partners. Advance Partners offers customizable solutions to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding and outsourcing services. We are excited about the opportunity this acquisition provides and believe it\u2019s a great fit. The temporary staffing industry has experienced expanded growth and clients are within our targeted market of small and midsize businesses. Our consolidated financial results include Advance Partners from the date of the acquisition in late December. We remain committed to adding value to our shareholders. Last July, we increased our dividend by 11% to $0.42 a share and have maintained a strong dividend yield of over 3%, one of the highest in our industry. Our stock repurchase program remains in place, and we have acquired 2.2 million shares of common stock during the first nine months of fiscal \u201916. I would like to take a moment to mention something else we are very proud of. On March 10, we were recognized by Ethisphere Institute as a 2016 World\u2019s Most Ethical Company. As an eight-year honoree, we believe this award underscores our commitment to leading ethical business standards and practices ensuring long-term value to key stakeholders, including our customers, our investors and employees. We are one of only two companies in the outsourcing services category honored this year. In summary, we saw continued strong execution from our sales and service teams, our product and financial performance remains strong, and I appreciate the great work of our Paychex employee team. We are focused on a strong finish to fiscal 2016 in a few months here. I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks Marty. Good morning. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that during today\u2019s conference call, we\u2019ll make some forward-looking statements that refer to future events and thus involve risks. Refer to the usual disclosures. As Marty indicated, our third quarter financial results for this fiscal year reflect continued progress across major product lines. I\u2019ll cover the highlights and provide greater detail in certain areas, then wrap with a review of the 2016 outlook. Total revenues, as you saw, grew 7% for the third quarter and nine months to $753 million and $2.2 billion respectively. Total service revenue also grew 7% for the third quarter and nine months to $741 million and $2.2 billion respectively. Interest on funds held for clients increased 11% for the third quarter and 8% for the nine months to $12 million and $34 million respectively. We are beginning to see some positive impact from recent increases in interest rates. Average invested balances for clients\u2019 funds were basically flat year-over-year as the positive impact from client growth was roughly offset by lower state unemployment insurance rates.  Total expenses increased 7% for both the third quarter and nine months. Compensation-related costs were the largest contributor to this growth, driven by higher wages and performance-based comp. In addition, strong growth in the PEO and the additional cost for Advance Partners in this quarter were factors in expense growth.  Operating income net of certain items increased 6% for the third quarter and 9% for the nine months to $268 million and $837 million respectively. We maintained strong operating margins of 36% for the third quarter and 39% for the nine months, but anticipate that our full-year will remain within our guidance of approximately 38%. As a reminder, we typically experience lower operating margins in the back half of the fiscal year. Net income was up 7% to $180 million for the third quarter and 13% to $579 million for the nine months. Diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $0.50 per share for the third quarter and 13% to $1.60 per share for the nine months. The nine month period was positively impacted by the net tax benefit related to prior year revenues that were recognized in the first quarter. Excluding this impact, net income and diluted earnings per share would have risen 9% and 10% respectively, and what you see in EPS is a function also of the effect of buybacks that we\u2019ve done over the past year. Payroll service revenue increased 4% for both the third quarter and nine months to $440 million and $1.3 billion respectively. We benefited from increases in client base and revenue per check. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting. Advance Partners contributed slightly less than 1% to payroll service revenue growth for the third quarter, and let me repeat that - slightly less than 1% to payroll service revenue growth for the quarter.  I would say one other thing - checks per client in the quarter moderated. This was partly a result of two things. One is in the third quarter, benefit--I should say bonus checks are--typically we assume they are going to be a little bit higher than the year before. That didn\u2019t end up being the case this year, although it\u2019s difficult to quantify, and we had a little bit of impact that was a result of client mix in the quarter. So Q3 is a little bit tough to predict in that respect. We ended up a little bit lighter than we had projected.  HRS revenue increased 12% to $301 million for the third quarter and 13% to $865 million for the nine months. We are pleased with the growth for the quarter. If you recall, last quarter we indicated that we anticipated Q3 HRS revenue growth to be below the low end of the range for our annual guidance. This was due to a comparison to a stronger quarter in the prior year. We exceeded expectations, landing in the middle of the range.  The increase reflected strong growth in both clients and worksite employees at Paychex HRS Services, our largest HRS revenue stream which includes ASO and PEO products, and we continued to have strong growth in PEO revenue in the quarter. Insurance services benefited from continued growth of our ACA product that assists clients with healthcare reform, and an increase in health and benefits [indiscernible], together with higher average premiums and clients in our workers comp insurance programs.  One other note, and we called this out in our investor day. I want to just highlight this - HCM module revenues that assist clients in HR administration and time and attendance also were strong in the quarter. You don\u2019t see that in the payroll service revenue because of the way we account for it, but as we will discuss during the call when we get questions on sales, we had a strong performance in mid-market, and you see that reflected in HRS, not in payroll. Advance Partners contributed slightly more than 1% to HRS revenue growth for the quarter. Now turning to our investment portfolio, our goal continues to be the protection of principal and optimization of liquidity. On the short term side, our primary short-term interest vehicles were bank demand deposit accounts, U.S. treasury securities, and high quality commercial paper. In our longer term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and U.S. government securities. Long term portfolio has an average yield to maturity currently of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.2 years. Combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1% for the third quarter and 1.1% for the nine months. In December, the Fed raised federal funds rates by 25 basis points. This was the first interest rate hike in nearly a decade, as you know. With this, we have raised our guidance on our interest on funds held for clients to high single digits, where we had previously indicated it would be relatively flat. That simply reflects what you\u2019re already seeing in the numbers, so it\u2019s really not a significant change in guidance. I\u2019ll now walk you through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong. We had cash and total investments of $756 million as of the end of the quarter. Note that funds held for clients as of February 29 were $4.7 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31, 2015. As you know, funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $4.5 billion for the quarter and $4 billion for the nine months.  Total available for sale investments, including corporate investments in funds held for clients, reflected net capitalized gains--unrealized, I should say, gains of $61 million as of February 29 compared with net unrealized gains of $14 million as of May 31, 2015. Total stockholders equity was $1.9 million as of February 29, reflecting $455 million in dividends paid during the nine months and $108 million of common shares repurchased. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a sterling 39%. Our cash flows from operations were also strong this quarter, and I want to call that out. They totaled $791 million for the first nine months, and again a very, very strong 14% increase from the prior year. The change was a result of higher net income, higher non-cash adjustments to net income, and positive fluctuations in working capital. So from a financial metrics perspective, we\u2019re very pleased with where we ended. Now onto the 2016 guidance. I\u2019d like to remind you that it\u2019s based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions. Guidance for the full year is unchanged from previous quarters except as I mentioned for interest on funds held for clients. I\u2019ll reiterate some of our full-year ranges and then give some concluding color. Payroll service revenue anticipated in the range of 4 to 5%. That obviously also includes the addition of Advance payroll in that number. HRS revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 10 to 13% - again, Advance is in that number, and we obviously expect it will be at the high end of that number. Total service revenue is anticipated to be in the range of 7 to 8%, again towards the high end of that number, and net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 8 to 9%. Please note that the range excludes the benefit of the net tax benefit we recorded in the first quarter. Effective tax rate for the year, also excluding the impact of the net tax benefit recorded in the first quarter, will be approximately 36%. Interest on funds held for clients is now expected to grow in the high single digits, as I said, as a result of recent increases in interest rates. Current guidance does not anticipate any additional increases in the Fed funds rate for the remainder of the fiscal year, and if someone can decipher what the Fed is saying, I would be interested in getting schooled on the subject. Finally, we anticipate the contribution of Advance Partners is going to add somewhere between 1 and 1.5% to total service revenue in the fourth quarter, so that\u2019s a bit of color on what\u2019s happening there.  Finally, we anticipate higher selling expense in the last quarter of the year. We had strong sales and comp will be up as a result of that, and higher ops expense due to stronger sales also, and also client on-boarding for ACA compliance solutions. We anticipate with all of this that our operating margins in the fourth quarter will be between 35 and 36%, bringing the full-year margin in line with our previous guidance of approximately 38%. With that, I will turn it back to Marty. Martin Mucci : Okay, great. Thanks Efrain. Operator, we\u2019ll now open it up for any questions or comments. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Hussein of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Daniel Hussein : Hi, good morning Marty and Efrain. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start off by asking about small business hiring. Your index suggests there\u2019s been stability in the past few quarters, but we\u2019ve seen mixed data points elsewhere about optimism and hiring and heard a more cautious tone from one of your competitors. Maybe could you just talk a little bit more about what trends you\u2019re seeing there? Martin Mucci : Yes, what we\u2019ve seen with the Paychex IHS Small Business Index, which we released for the month yesterday, we saw the best three-month increase in the job growth rate for small businesses under 50 in two years, so this wiped out all the decrease that--we saw kind of a decrease in the growth rate at the end of \u201915, calendar year 2015, and then this first quarter we saw that bounce back and kind of wipe out all the decrease. So we think that small business hiring, job growth is on the upswing right now. It\u2019s not huge but it certainly has recovered the decrease we saw last year, so we\u2019re pretty optimistic about it.  We\u2019re seeing it--you know, there is some part-time in there that we\u2019re seeing increase as well, and you\u2019re seeing it in services or in sectors of jobs like other services and leisure and hospitality, where there tends to be some part-time jobs. But we\u2019re definitely seeing some optimism in the job growth rate. Daniel Hussein : Got it, thanks. You were expecting, I think, a potential second wind with ACA selling as you approached or past in the most recent employer mandate deadline. It may be too early to say now, but are you getting any read from your sales force on whether you\u2019re seeing interest pick up again over these past few weeks, or accelerate? Martin Mucci : I haven\u2019t heard it yet, but I think as the deadline for the 1095Cs tomorrow hits, and there has been a lot of activity obviously in the last 30 days with clients and those who were not providing some of the data and now are scrambling to give data and make sure that they\u2019re covered, I think--you know, we still expect that we\u2019ll see a second wave pick-up here somewhat in the next quarter, but I haven\u2019t really heard that yet. But I do think it will pick up. Daniel Hussein : Got it, thank you. Maybe one last quick one. Could you call out any non-recurring costs related to the Advance Partners acquisition, either the deal or integration costs? Efrain Rivera : There weren\u2019t any integration costs, but obviously our expenses were higher. I think I called it out in the comments that essentially in the quarter, the additional revenue from Advance Partners was matched by the additional expense, so it\u2019s recurring, it\u2019s not non-recurring, but it\u2019s in those numbers. Daniel Hussein : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Ryan Cary : Good morning, guys. This is Ryan Cary calling in for Jason. Just wanted to ask a question on the growth in the core payroll business in the quarter, which came in a little bit below where we had modeled. I know you called out growth for the quarter to be at the low end of the full-year range at kind of the 4 to 5%. Once I exclude the benefit from Advance, it looks like the growth is more in that 3% range. So first, is this the right way to be thinking about this; and second, anything in particular that was a drag in the quarter? And then just lastly, how should we think about the full-year guidance range? Should we now expect growth maybe at the lower end of the range? Efrain Rivera : Wow, you pack, Ryan, a lot of questions in one sentence, so let me unpack that. So I think you\u2019re right that about 3% is correct. In my comments, I called out specifically that the driver of that being--of the 3%, which by the way is up sequentially from the comparable quarter a year ago where we were a little bit over 2%, really was driven by checks. There\u2019s two things that happened, because I\u2019ll get a number of questions on this on the call. Third quarter is unusual compared to every other quarter in the year because third quarter is a quarter where you have more checks than normal due to bonus checks. There is simply no way to figure it out, and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time looking at dollars to figure out whether they equate to checks, so we don\u2019t know whether there just may have been lower check volume in part because of bonus checks. And then the second thing that I called out is our client mix was a little bit lower in the quarter than we modeled, and so the combination of both of those drove the rate down a little bit. We\u2019ll have to see whether that\u2019s a trend that continues. In part, there is a good point to that. Our unit sales growth is at this point trending about two times, double what it was last year, so when you have that, you tend to have a mix that skews a little bit lower. Then one other point that I would make on that is that the way that we report numbers, what you see as payroll is simply the portion of a bundle that is payroll. It really says nothing literally until you can aggregate to that the non-payroll portion of the sales that are made in the mid-market, and there we saw some nice pick-up in the quarter.  So I think the short of it, after I\u2019ve said all of that, checks were a little bit lighter in the quarter than we anticipated. We\u2019ll see whether that\u2019s a trend that continues. Client mix skewed a little bit smaller than we had projected, but we\u2019ll see where we go from here. And know when I say--those of you who know when we talk about guidance, when I say it\u2019s between 4 and 5, you can peg where we expect it to be. Ryan Cary : Great. Then I believe on the last couple calls, you\u2019ve called out new bookings growth, kind of the low double-digits range. How should we think of this trend through the key selling season? Would you say it\u2019s roughly in line with where it\u2019s been the past couple quarters? Any color would be appreciated. Martin Mucci : Yes, I think we were pleased with the selling season, and I think year-to-date we\u2019ve continued to see that double-digit, low double-digit growth. So we\u2019re happy, and that\u2019s kind of across the board for the different divisions, so we\u2019re feeling good about it. Ryan Cary : Great, thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim McHugh of William Blair. Your line is now open. Tim McHugh : Hi guys, thanks. Just wanted to ask about the comment you just made about unit sales being 2x less what they were trending last year, I guess. When you say unit sales, can you be--I mean, is that net client growth? What do you referring to as unit sales? Efrain Rivera : Yes, so unit sales are going to--obviously you need to know what losses are, but that\u2019s one, the first part of the equation. So unit sales growth is trending higher than it was last year, and because sales--I\u2019m sorry, losses are trending in line with where they were last year, we\u2019re expecting obviously decent net client growth. Tim McHugh : Okay. You\u2019re not willing to say, I guess, year-to-date where you\u2019re at with that, Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Well year-to-date, I\u2019d say this, Tim, that our net client growth year-to-date is higher than it was last year. Tim McHugh : Okay. Just going back to another comment you made, the margin, 35 to 36 for Q4, was that excluding interest revenue or was that kind of that GAAP number? Efrain Rivera : Yes, that\u2019s our op income margin, yes, excluding. Tim McHugh : Excluding interest? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Tim McHugh : Okay, just wanted to be clear. Efrain Rivera : No, no, I get your question. Thanks for clarifying. Tim McHugh : Okay. Then you highlighted lastly--you referred to a middle market a few times as really a particular area of strength, and I think you talked about time and attendance and that bucket. Can you just--I guess, where are you seeing strength in middle market, and can you remind us maybe at this point how big that is and, I guess, how much more quickly is that growing given the core overall business, I guess, to add some perspective? Martin Mucci : Yes Tim, I\u2019ll take that. I think--you know, what we\u2019re excited about is I think we\u2019re seeing the payoff for all the technology investment that we\u2019ve made, and so with Flex having added that full product suite, we\u2019re selling a lot more--we\u2019re selling more clients and we\u2019re selling a lot more full bundled clients with full time and attendance and HR support, benefit enrolment, benefit administration, et cetera. So we don\u2019t break out the client base specifically, but it is growing. The sales are growing very well year-to-date, and at the highest rate that it\u2019s been probably since pre-recession. So the mid-market has come on very strong year-to-date and certainly seeing that growth stronger than on the small end. All sales are doing well year-to-date, but that\u2019s the strongest we\u2019ve seen. Tim McHugh : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Gary Bisbee : Hi guys, good morning. In light of the commentary on strong sales, retention remaining, I guess, stable but at a very good level, I guess I\u2019m struggling to think through how we should think about what that means for service revenue growth, because if we adjust last year for the change in PEO presentation, it really doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019ve seen any acceleration in service revenue growth, and if you back out the acquisition this quarter, one might even argue you\u2019ve seen modest deceleration in the last quarter versus last year\u2019s trend. So how should the better bookings and stable retention flow through? I know you don\u2019t want to talk about 2017 at this point, but is there any reason that we shouldn\u2019t expect that all the positive stuff you\u2019ve talked about is going to lead to the top line growth accelerating on an organic basis? Efrain Rivera : Yes Gary, I\u2019d say Q3 is kind of a weird quarter in the sense that there\u2019s always some elements of timing in it, and if I just pick on the quarter and project Q3 forward and say what do you assume about that, I think you\u2019ve got to add in Q4 to get a better picture because the back half tells a better picture, and sequentially Q4 is going to be stronger than Q3. But I think you need to take both of those quarters together, and that gives you a more accurate picture of where the company is going. I think that obviously you\u2019ve got projections, and there are street projections out there, and they seem reasonably in line with what we expect is going to happen, and then we\u2019ll issue guidance off of that. So I don\u2019t--you know, this is not a business where you can project one quarter to tell you what the rest of the year is going to look like, because there is always elements of timing, when days fall. For example, this quarter ended on a Monday. Whether the quarter ends on a Monday or a Thursday can have some impacts on revenue, so I\u2019d say you really need to look at 3 and 4 to kind of form a better opinion. Gary Bisbee : Okay, fair enough. Efrain Rivera : But we\u2019re pleased--you know, just one other thing, Gary. When we look at the key indicators--before this call, I looked at 12 key indicators. I\u2019m looking at client base, I\u2019m looking at discounting, I\u2019m looking at net client growth, I\u2019m looking at sales units, I\u2019m looking at annualized sales revenue - I mean, every vector was pointing in the right direction. The only item in the quarter that was a little bit lighter than we anticipated was checks and there is some variability in that, so it doesn\u2019t concern me significantly. Gary Bisbee : Okay, great. Thanks. Then just--you know, I\u2019ve asked you this before, but I feel like I keep needing to ask it. You\u2019ve had this strength in bookings, we\u2019ve seen it from a lot of other HR outsourcing companies, and I think at some level the Affordable Care Act has led companies to--you know, a lot of businesses to take a fresh look and decide if they should outsource more, and it\u2019s not just the ACA compliance but I think broadly PEO and other have benefited. Do you have any better sense at this point if any of that has been pulling forward future sales, or there is risk of now having to at some point in the next year comp this very strong growth in bookings you\u2019ve seen and it gets a lot more difficult, or are you--does what you\u2019re hearing from your sales force and whatnot lead you to believe more that this is going to be a sustainable trend of more desired outsourcing? Thank you. Martin Mucci : That\u2019s a good question. I think it certainly has pulled some sales forward for clients who may not have made the choice to outsource before the Affordable Care Act kind of pushed them into it, but I also think in a general sense that we\u2019ve talked about the last few years, you see the need for HR and the acceptance of outsourcing and going to an HR administration and a SaaS-based product for time and attendance, HR administration, benefit enrolment, payroll, we\u2019ve seen that certainly come down in size from 50 employees to 100 employees, down below 50. So I think there is still plenty of opportunity to have strong sales, even--it\u2019s not just the Affordable Care Act. So we still feel good about the opportunity for future sales because the demand has come down, so meaning more clients are interested in it and gaining value from it, and the fact that I think we\u2019ve invested very timely in our products and service model to be able to respond to that increased demand. Gary Bisbee : Great, and then just one last one from me. If I\u2019m doing the math right on Advance Partners, it looks like you paid a pretty healthy multiple, eight or nine times sales and 20 times EBITDA, or something like that for this business. Can you just give us a better sense how you justify that price as a reasonable price, and particularly given the highly cyclical end market it operates in, how confident are you they can continue to grow the business at the rates that they're doing? Thanks a lot. Efrain Rivera : Okay, hey Gary, I think your numbers are off, so let me just correct your assumption. So we actually paid somewhere between four and five times revenue for it, and we paid less than 10 times EBITDA for it. We don\u2019t typically overpay, so that\u2019s Part A, so I think your numbers are slightly off. The second part is we are not in the staffing business, and we have no interest in being in the staffing business, but we have a lot of interest in providing back office services to the staffing business because we think from a secular growth perspective, and Marty alluded to it earlier in his comments, we think temp staffing is going to do nothing but go up, Part A. Part B is there is lots of small and medium sized staffing firms, and those of you who cover that industry know that, and for every large staffing company there\u2019s always spinoffs that need financing and funding and back office services. So we had looked at this transaction literally for three years before we pulled the trigger, to convince ourselves that the growth rates were real and that there\u2019s an opportunity for someone with the right kind of both service and capital availability to come in and make an impact. So we are very, very comfortable about both of those issues, and that\u2019s really what drove the transaction, and so far, so good. Gary Bisbee : Great, thank you. I appreciate the color. Efrain Rivera : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Bryan Keane : Hi guys, good morning. I heard the comments about the mid-market being strong. Just curious the low end and then the high end, any changes in the dynamics of the market, especially competitively, that you guys saw in the key selling season? Martin Mucci : Not really, Bryan. We\u2019re not seeing much change from a competitive standpoint, frankly, in any of the markets. We focus primarily on that small to midsize, up to 1,000, and primarily I\u2019d say up to 500 or so, and again very strong on the mid-market and the low end was kind of as expected in a typical selling season. As Efrain and I both mentioned, year-to-date our net client gain is the best it\u2019s been since pre-recession levels, so we\u2019re feeling good about not only the sales side of it but also the retention. Bryan Keane : And then just thinking about this key selling season, how did net pricing look? How did that come out for the quarter and for year-to-date? Efrain Rivera : Look - I think, Bryan, pricing is always competitive during the selling season. This was no different, and as I\u2019ve mentioned in a number of meetings, you discount during the quarter at a level that\u2019s appropriate to get the business, and then over time if you deliver service, you have a chance to recoup that discount. So I would say it was comparable to what we\u2019ve seen in prior years. Bryan Keane : Okay, and then just finally for me, on checks per client, I know they moderated and I think I understand that for the third quarter. What does that mean for the fourth quarter? Does it bounce back, or does it stay at this depressed level? Thanks so much. Efrain Rivera : I wouldn\u2019t use depression, but I use the word moderated. Look - I don\u2019t completely--I can\u2019t completely answer that question because bonus checks, as I mentioned earlier, in Q3 have an impact, so it could be that we see a little bit lighter checks per client going into the fourth quarter because of client mix. But I would assume that\u2019d be a little bit lighter than we had initially projected in Q4. Bryan Keane : Okay, thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Kartik Mehta : Good morning, Marty and Efrain. I wanted to ask a little bit about the Advance Partners acquisition. Is this an acquisition where--you know, you talked about the temp business growing, so is this a business that you anticipate growing organically by using your balance sheet and your distribution, or is this something where you have to go acquire some other companies and other geographies to build a little bit of scale for this business? Martin Mucci : Well I think primarily it\u2019s organically. There may be some opportunity, just like they would have if they were on their own, to acquire other companies, and they\u2019ll always look at that just like we are, that are in that kind of business. But organically what we saw was a great leadership team that had been producing solid growth, and it fits our market. It\u2019s small and midsized staffing companies that they provide everything from payroll funding to payroll outsourcing to HR support, and we think it\u2019s a good fit and we saw their clients, that\u2019s a growing industry with their clients. When we started getting into this, we were surprised at the thousands of small independent staffing firms that needed that support, and we thought they were providing a great product and had lots of growth opportunities. When you couple that with the fact that we have a number of staffing companies as clients, independent staffing companies as payroll clients, we now, I think, can take to our clients additional product and services that they offer, and that will help their growth even more. So we saw it as a really good fit, not only from a product to service, a market and a leadership team vantage point. Kartik Mehta : Then Efrain, you\u2019re in a very enviable position. You have a balance sheet with almost $700 million cash, no debt. I saw you bought back some shares this quarter, and I guess going forward, what\u2019s up? What\u2019s the strategy? Do you think you would continue buying back shares, or is this price, kind of where the stock is prevent that, or are there acquisition opportunities? Is there anything changing in that environment that would allow you to take advantage of maybe acquiring a company? Efrain Rivera : Yes, so three questions. I would say this, that when you look at the results for the quarter, EPS was up 9% and shares were down, so we\u2019ve been slowly whittling away at the share count and would anticipate that we\u2019ll be flat to modestly down in the future. So we do have--we added share buybacks into our capital distribution approach, but Kartik, the second point is that--and Advance is one example of it, so for a number of years you\u2019ve heard us say that we wanted to keep some powder dry to be able to move quickly to do acquisitions. [Indiscernible] pipeline is as robust as it\u2019s really been in the last three or four years, and there are a number of acquisitions that we\u2019re looking at that could consume much or all, or even more of that cash, so we\u2019d prefer at this point until that pipeline dries up to focus on the right kinds of selective M&A as a use of that cash. If in the next 12 months those opportunities don\u2019t materialize, then we\u2019ll have that discussion. Marty and I have had that discussion with the board, and at this point Part A is do M&A and then Part B will be--we\u2019ll reach that when M&A is no longer an opportunity. Kartik Mehta : Thanks Efrain, appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from SK Prasad Borra of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. SK Prasad Borra : Thanks for taking my questions. A couple, if I may. First, probably on just the revenue visibility, has anything changed this year compared to, say, the last few years? You had seen specifically from the point of view that the unit growth you are talking about, that seems to have closer doubled compared to the trends you were seeing last year, and your revenue retention seems to be pretty stable, so what should stop from payroll growth to accelerate in the next few quarters? Efrain Rivera : So SK, just a few points on that. So I think we have been very effective at the low end of the market in capturing units as compared to last year. In order to have significant growth in unit acceleration that would be visible in two or three quarters, we need to have sustained--continued sustained unit growth, and we look at strategies that drive that. I mean, we\u2019re fairly unique in that we play both in the micro space with everything from SurePayroll to the mid-market space with our Paychex Flex integrated solution, so we\u2019ll have to have a number of continued strong quarters in terms of unit growth to drive that higher. But one thing I want to emphasize, which I said earlier, for us as we think about payroll service revenue growth, increasingly what we think about is HCM platform service growth, and we\u2019re seeing that already. You see that in the HRS numbers. What our sales people do, a sales person in our 1 to 50 or small market sales force, they are not simply selling a payroll-only solution. They are increasingly selling a bundled HCM solution, and we\u2019re seeing benefits from that. The benefits don\u2019t flow into the payroll service revenue line because the portion of the HCM platform, particularly HR administration and time and attendance where we\u2019re seeing really good growth, really is reflected in HRS.  So I think we\u2019re seeing a bit of both, and we\u2019re going to focus on both driving revenue by selling more integrated HCM and also driving units by approaching that smaller market aggressively. SK Prasad Borra : Okay, that\u2019s great. Probably just one on the cost side. Marty [indiscernible] mentioned that the implementation costs have slightly been higher compared to recent quarters. Are you broadly enough capturing that in terms of your headcount increase, and would you expect the implementation costs to stabilize now, especially the ones related to ACA, or do you expect that to inflect higher over the next few quarters? Martin Mucci : I think it\u2019s stabilized at this point, unless we have a big influx of new sales. But I think this was the most difficult quarter to get through in getting all of the first--you know, first time going through getting all the 1095C forms out and so forth, so we ramped up for that. I think that will be--I\u2019m not sure that that will decrease necessarily at this stage, but I think we\u2019ve ramped up and I think we\u2019re holding pretty well at this stage, and then any other additional headcount will really depend on sales and the number of net clients that we\u2019re adding. Obviously we\u2019ve said the net client gain is better than last year, better than we\u2019ve seen in a few years, so that may drive some headcount; but I don\u2019t see any big jump over what we\u2019ve already done. SK Prasad Borra : That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks Marty, thanks Efrain. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. David Togut : Thanks, good morning. Just a quick follow-up on the strength in the mid-market. Trying to piece together what you\u2019re seeing with what ADP is seeing. For example, they called out an unusual drop in client retention in the December quarter, particularly tied to slower than expected transition from a legacy platform to their cloud-based workforce now. So I\u2019m just trying to understand, is the strength in the mid-market somehow tied to this probably short term drop in client retention at ADP, or do you think it\u2019s all related to upgrades related to Flex? Martin Mucci : I think it\u2019s more the upgrades related to Flex, so I think we\u2019re holding--you know, we\u2019re maintaining a good retention in our mid-market clients, but the sales have increased and it hasn\u2019t been, I don\u2019t think, from any one competitor. I think we\u2019re doing well against our main competitor there, but I think we\u2019re winning--we\u2019re just winning more because the product and the service levels are better. So it doesn\u2019t feel like a one-time thing to me. The sales have accelerated and shown consistency. David Togut : When specifically did sales start accelerating in mid-market? Martin Mucci : You know, pretty much the last two quarters, but I think mostly this quarter as you get to year-end, it\u2019s a little bit skewed. But really, we got to the point last fall, September-October, when we really had kind of the full suite brought into the software-as-a-service product, the Flex. We added the complete time and attendance and benefit administration and enrolment, and the electronic paperless on-boarding really kind of came together on a single employee record in the September-October time frame, and that is when we started to pick up speed. David Togut : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Eskelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Rick Eskelsen : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just wanted to ask a little bit on the HR outsourcing side and the PEO and the ASO, just sort of what are you seeing on demand in clients\u2019 acceptance of one versus the other? Are you seeing more clients move to the full service PEO model rather than ASO? Just kind of get that dynamics between the two of those, and then just more on the demand, which I believe was strong on the PEO. Martin Mucci : Yes, I think we haven\u2019t really seen a big shift there, maybe a little bit leaning toward the PEO given the fact that--you know, the Affordable Care Act requirements. But I think we\u2019re still seeing sales both sides grow pretty well, it\u2019s just a preference, and that\u2019s why we feel very good that we have sales and service folks that kind of handle both, so they really respond to the client needs and what the best fit is. You still see PEO predominantly in certain states where there\u2019s a comfort level with it and there\u2019s just a better knowledge of it, but we\u2019re seeing that expand to a few other states but it\u2019s still primarily in those PEO states, as I guess I\u2019d say. Rick Eskelsen : Thanks. Just one follow-up. We\u2019ve read in the press some stories about funding getting tougher for start-ups in certain situations. Two parts to the question, I guess - first, what impact, if any, does that have on your client base and growth in new client opportunities for you; and then second, what impact might that have on the competitive environment out there for you guys? Thank you. Martin Mucci : Yes, I would start by saying we haven\u2019t heard or seen it get that much more difficult. I think some small business lenders, it\u2019s come down, but you know, there\u2019s been actually--you know, it\u2019s always difficult to fund new start-ups, and the hardest--the biggest hit to that was the drop in the home equity, because that\u2019s really how a lot of these got started, and that happened back in the recession. So if anything, I think some of that has come back and not so much tightened. Now, you\u2019ve got also an explosion of online offerings that will provide lending to small businesses if they have some credit, so I don\u2019t--we haven\u2019t seen it have much of an impact on us at all. There was really a big impact in the recession, and I think that has slowly come back. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Yes, just a little bit more color on that, just to build on what Marty said. I mentioned earlier that payroll sales, or sales units this year are trending above last year. Actually, sales units are growing about twice the rate that they did last year - the sales units, that\u2019s not client base. But what\u2019s interesting is when you disaggregate that number, our sales units from new business start-ups actually were up about 7% in the quarter, so it looks like the environment--and that\u2019s a good development for us because obviously 50% or more of our sales in a given quarter come from newly started businesses, so that\u2019s a good development. It says the environment is good for sales. Rick Eskelsen : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim MacDonald of Analysis. Your line is now open. Jim MacDonald : Good morning, guys. I had a couple of follow-up questions on Advance Partners. I think I heard that the impact on the payroll side was less than 1%, and I couldn\u2019t quite hear the impact--there was also an impact on the HR side. Was that slightly more than 1%? Efrain Rivera : Yes, slightly more than 1%. Jim MacDonald : Okay. So on Advance Partners, what kind of integration plan do you have, and what kind of timing to maybe bring it to the rest of your client base? Martin Mucci : Yes Jim, we\u2019re already in process of--you know, we have identified the clients that we have that are independent staffing agencies. We\u2019re working with the sales team at Advance to get them out and talking to them, where they already have a relationship with Paychex and now will see this as an additional offering. It\u2019s early stage - we closed it at the end of December, but I think we\u2019ve already been working on having identified the clients, get them in the hands of the sales team, make sure the sales team understands, and be very careful with how they approach those clients because they\u2019re Paychex clients and we\u2019re trying to approach them but offer them additional services and support.  You know, as Efrain said earlier, we don\u2019t see any big one-time integration costs for this. That\u2019s another great thing about the acquisition and bringing them into the Paychex family. We saw ongoing expense and ongoing revenue and expense, but no big one-time integration costs. It\u2019s really just bringing the groups together. Efrain Rivera : By the way, Jim, just a point. I was asked earlier about specific integration costs in the quarter. There were a modest amount, maybe between a million and two in the quarter. We just absorbed it, didn\u2019t call it out especially in the numbers. Thought it was just not important. Jim MacDonald : Great. Maybe just one follow-up. So do you expect to be able to accelerate Advance Partners\u2019 growth now that you\u2019re bringing them into your base? Martin Mucci : Yes, we hope so. I mean, we certainly would model it that way. As we did the acquisition, we felt that they had good growth but they were somewhat limited from a capital perspective, obviously, and from a cash perspective for their funding, for the funding of their clients and the work that they do. And then, just the client base that we have, I think between those two, we do expect to be able to help them accelerate their growth. Jim MacDonald : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much. Just a couple quick follow-up questions. Marty, at the beginning of the call, I think you said that year-to-date you\u2019ve seen your best client gains since the recession. Are you talking about total clients, are you talking payroll clients, HR clients? Can you just qualify that a little bit? Martin Mucci : Sure, it\u2019s payroll clients. We always kind of talk about it as payroll clients, so it\u2019s the net client gain of the total payroll base, the one that we give kind of once at a year at the end of the year. We\u2019ll give the base, and year-to-date we\u2019ve seen the best net client gain because of a combination of both better sales and solid retention since the recession. Efrain Rivera : And Jeff, we typically have been saying that we\u2019ll be between one and three, and if you looked at our numbers, we\u2019ve been slightly under two in prior years, and we\u2019re trending pretty solidly between two and three. So it takes a while for a client base of 600,000 clients to grow, but we feel pretty good about where we\u2019re at. Jeff Silber : Okay, great. I just wanted to double-check on that. Then Efrain, you were asked about the purchase price for Advance Partners. I think you said it\u2019s something in the range of four to five times revenues and less than 10 times EBITDA. What time frame are we talking about for the revenues and EBITDA - is it forward-looking, backward-looking? Efrain Rivera : Backward-looking, and it would have been their calendar 2015, which of course you don\u2019t have any access to. But yes, so we acquired them right at the end of December and we paid between four and five times revenue. But I would just say this about Advance, and they\u2019ve done a phenomenal job. There are very, very few businesses that we have looked at, and we have looked at many, many whose EBITDA margins are at or exceed Paychex, so obviously that got our attention. Jeff Silber : Okay. I\u2019m sorry, just one more clarification on that. That includes the debt that you absorbed in the transaction net of cash? Efrain Rivera : Yes, so--no Jeff, so part of the--you\u2019ll see when we do the Q disclosures, we settle it out. We paid off an existing loan that they had, chose to not re-fund it. We\u2019ll fund it again, that\u2019s the way the business works, but then we acquired a number of receivables that basically offset the amount of the loan. So on a net basis when you filter through that, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. It will have a--the disclosure in the Q which we\u2019ll file at the end of the day is pretty explicit. Jeff Silber : Okay, great. We\u2019ll take a look at it then. Thanks so much. Efrain Rivera : Okay, thanks. Call me if there is any questions on it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Grossman of Stifel Financial. Your line is now open. David Grossman : Thanks, good morning. So sorry to ask another question on growth so late in the call here, but I\u2019m just looking at the numbers and it would appear that if my math is right, that Advance adds about 60 basis points to the service growth for the year, but we maintained the guidance for the year for service revenue growth. That\u2019s when momentum in the businesses remain pretty strong and your tone is very positive, so I guess I understand the timing issue with bookings amongst some of the other things that you mentioned, but I guess I\u2019m still having a little trouble reconciling your tone with the guide for the year vis-\u00e0-vis the acquisition.  So if you feel you\u2019ve already addressed this, we could take this offline, or if you have anything incremental to add that may clarify it, that would be great. Efrain Rivera : No, I get it, David. I understand the point you\u2019re making. I think I said at the--during my comments that we expected the guide for revenue to be at the high end of the range, and I\u2019m not going to call out a 10 or 20 basis point difference, so obviously when we guide to 7 to 8, we think we\u2019re going to be somewhere in the middle of the range at the beginning of the year. I don\u2019t know whether 60 basis points is exactly correct - it\u2019s not probably directionally all that far off, but now I\u2019m into discussing whether it\u2019s going to be 8.1 or 7.9. It\u2019s just too close to call, especially because as I mentioned, checks were a little bit softer so I\u2019m a little bit cautious about where we end up in Q4. That\u2019s the color on that number. The trends are strong. David Grossman : Then on the dynamic between the strength in the middle market and how that gets recorded as payroll versus HRS, does that dynamic then continue into fiscal \u201917, so you see that--you know, you would probably see better HRS growth on a relative basis in payroll because of that mix dynamic? Efrain Rivera : Yes, that\u2019s right, David, and look - frankly, just to kind of expand on that, and you\u2019ve covered the company for a long time, 10 years ago what we did was we saw a payroll sales person either in the small market sell payroll - that\u2019s what they sold, and then if there were ancillaries, they were sold by an ancillary sales force. That was the product we had. I would say in the last five years, certainly since Marty was CEO, that dynamic has changed pretty significantly. Our financials reflect the old dynamic, not the new one, and the new dynamic is this, two things : much, much better sales efficiency so that when Mark has a client of a certain type that we\u2019ve identified, it\u2019s a team sale, but we\u2019ve already discussed that in prior calls. What\u2019s changed really over the last 18 months is that a small market payroll sales person is able to sell an HCM bundled product, and they are increasingly doing that, meaning our payroll sales people who used to sell payroll only now sell products that are actually included in the HRS revenue, which is time and attendance and also HR administration. So it is very, very possible that total revenue can grow nicely and payroll service revenue doesn\u2019t seem to be moving significantly, and that\u2019s a function of where the technology has been, where the market is heading, so we\u2019re going to have to figure out how we represent that a little bit more clearly. I think it is the case as we put more emphasis on selling more integrated bundles that you could very well see payroll service revenue not growing quite as fast, but you\u2019re seeing sustained growth in HRS because that\u2019s where the other components of that HCM revenue are being recorded. It wasn\u2019t a big deal several years ago. It\u2019s a bigger deal now. David Grossman : Great, well thanks for clarifying that. If I could, just one last question on Advance. Can you give us any sense of how much balance sheet exposure you have at any given point in time now that you\u2019ve got that acquisition? Efrain Rivera : Yes, so again, I\u2019ll just point you to the Q. We established a dedicated line of credit for Advance, and that number is going to be somewhere between 125 to $150 million. David Grossman : Okay, and is the vast majority of that outstanding at any given time? Efrain Rivera : Yes, it\u2019s going to be outstanding at any given time. By the way, just an aside, David, because I think it\u2019s a great question, one of the things that we looked at--they\u2019ve been around for 20 years, and obviously I--not I, we had a look at the acquisition very carefully. They\u2019ve had very, very few problems because they have a very, very extensive credit vetting process, and we have a really first-rate group that also does that, so we\u2019ve got--there is a lot of safeguards that go into what we do. David Grossman : Very good. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon of RW Baird. Your line is now open. Mark Marcon : Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Martin Mucci : How are you, Mark? Mark Marcon : Good, thank you. A couple of quick follow-ups. First of all, you said that the retention rate has improved. Can you give us a little bit of a feel for how much it\u2019s improved? Martin Mucci : Yes, and actually when we look at that client gain, retention has held pretty steady, which has been around our best ever, so we\u2019re right near our best ever retention. It hasn\u2019t really improved all that much, but it\u2019s holding very well even as the client--even as the sales have gone up, so we feel very good about that because sometimes as the sales increase, obviously the retention becomes more difficult as we\u2019re bringing in more clients. The sales have gone up. The retention, I\u2019d say has stayed pretty level as its best ever that we saw last year. Mark Marcon : So still in that 81% range? Martin Mucci : Yes, a little better, closer to 82, I think. Mark Marcon : Great. Then with regards to the comments on the mid-market, can you just quantify what portion of the mid-market you\u2019re seeing the strongest growth in? In other words, small market is up to 50 employees, then is it the 50 to 100, 50 to 200? How would you characterize that area that you\u2019re seeing the best growth in? Martin Mucci : Yes Mark, I\u2019ll probably go fairly broad there, but its 50--I\u2019d say 50 to 300. That\u2019s where the most new activity is, I think, when you see it because that\u2019s where there\u2019s need, particularly with the ACA compliance and so forth has come down and more are outsourcing and interested in outsourcing. So I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing probably the biggest jump. It\u2019s not in the 500-plus. You know, I\u2019m saying 300=plus, 250-plus, we\u2019re still doing fine there but the acceleration has been more that 50 to 250 or 300. Mark Marcon : Great. Then given all your comments with regards to selling additional modules, it sounds like you should have some confidence that the HRS growth is going to hold steady at these current levels that you\u2019re seeing for this year going forward, just given the dynamics, or is there something that would drive that down lower? Martin Mucci : I think--no, I feel pretty good about it. You never know, but at this stage--you know, the only questionable thing would be--we call it ESR, it would be ACA compliance, does that catch that second wave or not. But overall, I think you may see a second wave in ACA as well as health and benefit insurance. You know, from more people needing insurance, we made some headway there, but the 401K, the PEO, ASO all seem very steady, and as Efrain said, a lot of our bundled products on low and mid, being HR administration, on-boarding, time and attendance, all seem to be very--continuing to be very strong. So yes, I would expect that. Mark Marcon : What do you think the ACA on a direct basis is contributing to the second half of this year\u2019s growth? Efrain Rivera : Yes Mark, it\u2019s--so I\u2019ll answer it. That\u2019s my pause - I\u2019m trying to figure out how to best. It\u2019s probably less than 1%. Mark Marcon : Great. Then one follow-up with regards to the comment around--or the question around acquisitions. In terms of the acquisitions that you\u2019re looking at, are you looking at things that are still more in the Advance size range, or was there some suggestion that perhaps we could look at things that are even bigger and could potentially be a bigger impact with regards to the balance sheet? What\u2019s the minimum level of cash that you\u2019re comfortable holding on the balance sheet? Efrain Rivera : Yeah, boy, that\u2019s three questions, so let me answer. So Part A, Mark, would be that much of what we\u2019re looking at is in that Advance, kind of SurePayroll-Advance range, so that\u2019s Part A. Part B, and you\u2019ve heard me in conferences say this, we do look at larger acquisitions. It would have to be right, the numbers would have to add up, and it would have to give us some sort of durable, sustainable, competitive advantage in the market. We would look--not likely, but it\u2019s not out of the question. Minimum cash, it\u2019s lower than what we have on the balance sheet now, but this is a business where you have to project a sense of financial strength to the customers to whom--who are entrusting $4.5 billion of cash to use. So I don\u2019t know precisely where that is, but certainly you would need--I would say not just cash, but liquidity, and if you\u2019ve looked at what we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve been adding greater and greater liquidity over the last two or three years quietly to make sure that we\u2019re never in a position where there\u2019s any issues on that. Mark Marcon : Great. Just to go back to the mid-market, it sounds like most of the mid-market growth has really been through adding more modules as opposed to necessarily an increase in terms of competitive wins. Is that a correct interpretation, or do you think your competitive wins have actually increased as well? Martin Mucci : No, I don\u2019t think so. Our number of competitive wins has increased, and I think particularly as I mentioned in the fall as those products--as the whole product suite got under that single employee record and we had that full single sign-on kind of flexibility, no, they definitely have picked up. So while we certainly are bullish on how well we\u2019ve done on ancillary sales and add-ons and full packages, it\u2019s been also the payroll in the mid-market has been very strong, strongest its been in years, so we feel very good about the mid-market payroll sales as well - payroll and full bundle. Mark Marcon : Great, thanks for the clarification. Martin Mucci : Okay, Mark. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Lisa Ellis : Hi, good morning guys. I have a question about Flex. I know one of the unique aspects of Flex is that you\u2019ve got this, like, tiered service structure to it. How are you seeing client response to that? What types of service levels are the most popular? How are you seeing that evolve now that you\u2019ve rolled it out? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think for the mid-market, where we\u2019ve been talking a lot about this morning, I think the biggest, the best impact for our clients has been the multi-product centers that we\u2019ve been putting together. So in the past, you would have your payroll support and then you would have your additional products in unique supports, where they're uniquely trained on that product - time and attendance, an HRO. While that worked well, sometimes clients would say, geez, it would be even better if you were more connected as a team so that things between various products, if I had questions on how to use something or get the most value out of it. So those multi-product centers have been established by John Gibson and the team, and we\u2019re staffing those up now and we\u2019re seeing more clients come into those multi-product centers. That\u2019s probably been the biggest benefit. The other one is last year at some point, we went to 7/24 service, and that\u2019s been a benefit. I would say that\u2019s more of a benefit on the small end of clients, and we\u2019ve seen an increased use of that where they were doing payroll themselves online and it\u2019s off hours - it\u2019s Saturday, it\u2019s Sunday, it\u2019s a weeknight late at night and they get hung up on something that they want to do. They can call for that 7/24 support now, and that\u2019s gained a lot of interest and a lot of positive feedback as well. So I think it\u2019s that flexibility, and as well of course they can do a lot more self-service. They can do a lot more things themselves, and we\u2019re finding that clients don\u2019t actually stick to one service model. They this week might want to be doing more things themselves, then get hung up on creating a couple of special bonuses or something the next week and need support, and the next week they might need after-hours support. So it\u2019s that flexibility that we\u2019re finding is getting positive feedback. Lisa Ellis : Got it. So in that example, just a clarification. How does the pricing structure work, then? Martin Mucci : Not a significant change in pricing there. We don\u2019t really charge a lot extra for this. What we charge in the price--you know, if you\u2019re taking a full bundle of products and you\u2019re supported by the multi-product center, we feel you\u2019re paying for that level of support in the price of the product, so we\u2019re not having you sign up for various support levels. We feel that when you\u2019re buying a full product suite from us, we\u2019re going to give you a full multi-product service response to your needs. Lisa Ellis : Got it, okay. So you\u2019re seeing as you\u2019ve got new clients coming on to Flex, they\u2019re generally buying in the full service, because you\u2019ve got a different tiered pricing structure to it, right, with different-- Martin Mucci : Sure. I mean, there is payroll only, there is obviously various product bundles, and we\u2019re seeing more take multiple products. It\u2019s never enough for us - we\u2019d always like to see even more of that, but we certainly have a lot of payroll only but we also are picking up a lot of steam, as Efrain mentioned, with taking the full product suite right up front. Our model used to be, hey, let me sell you payroll, once you\u2019re used to it, it\u2019s working well, you\u2019re feeling good about our relationship, two months later we come in with a sales force on 401K or a sales force on time and attendance, or whatever. Now, we\u2019re selling much more of the full suite of products right up front in the sale through integrated or team selling. Lisa Ellis : Perfect, thank you. Thanks a lot. Martin Mucci : All right, you\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Tian Jing Wang of JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Tian Jing Wang : Hi, great. Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to ask, given the selling commentary here, can we infer that full service outsourcing demand is getting better versus self-service or point solutions? I know I\u2019ve asked that in the past, but I wanted to see if we could tie those things together. Martin Mucci : You know, I think it\u2019s kind of a mix. I mean, I do think there is--it\u2019s going both ways. You\u2019re seeing those with needs coming down, so I\u2019d say even 20-plus employees, sometimes 15 depending on the business, they want more of a full service solution, so they\u2019re not just looking for payroll, they\u2019re looking for help with recruiting and on-boarding their clients, and screening and all of that, that\u2019s tied right in with their payroll. They\u2019re not just looking for payroll, so there is that growth in demand.  Then, there is also on the low end much more of--there\u2019s more clients who say, hey, I just want an online solution with 7/24 support when I need it, and I\u2019m willing to do and I want to do more things myself. So we\u2019re trying--you know, the changes we\u2019ve been making the last few years in technology and service models have been to respond to kind of all of that, so if you\u2019re an online client, we\u2019ve made the online, and continuing to do that, actually, this next 12 months make it much easier, make it kind of an employee journey for the client so that they can walk through all the way from hiring right through to payroll, HR, et cetera in a very self-service format, if that\u2019s the way they want to do it. Tian Jing Wang : Okay, thanks for clarifying that. I\u2019m curious - any impact from Zenefits and what\u2019s going on there? Have you seen any sort of client change or coming back, et cetera, to Paychex? Martin Mucci : A little bit. I don\u2019t think we lost a lot to them, but we have seen a little bit of a pick-up on the health insurance side, I think where they probably lost some clients due to the concern about them and so forth, and the licensing and compliance. So we\u2019ve picked up some there. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s measurable or anything, but particularly in those markets on the west, midwest and west coast where it\u2019s been most visible, I think we\u2019ve probably picked up a little bit of demand there. Tian Jing Wang : All right, great. Thanks for the time, guys. Martin Mucci : Okay, you\u2019re welcome. Any more questions, Olive? Operator : We have our last question from Sara Gubins from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Sara Gubins : Hi, thank you. Just a couple quick ones. First, do you have what the final year one adoption of the ACA product was? I know you talk about it being a little bit over 50%. Efrain Rivera : Yes, that\u2019s kind of where we ended up, Sara. Now, just to clarify that, and Marty talked a little bit about the second wave, as new clients are coming on, particularly mid-market clients, you get a chance to sell the service, so that number as a percentage in the base could end up higher. But the initial wave was a little bit north of 50%. Sara Gubins : Okay. Then Efrain, there was discussion about mix trending down, and that was an impact on the quarter. You also talk about new business sales being about 7%, which was pretty impressive. Is that pick-up versus recent quarters? I\u2019m trying to understand how much of the mix down might be because of new business formation as opposed to growth in SurePayroll. I know I\u2019m mixing terms between total client growth and-- Efrain Rivera : No, I get it. It\u2019s a fair question. So we\u2019ve seen sales in new businesses trending up. Q3 was a strong quarter in terms of sales to new businesses, so that\u2019s number one. When you do that, Sara, you\u2019re correct that the units that you sell then have this impact of driving checks down a bit, and in Q3 it\u2019s been particular--it\u2019s tricky because you lose the most amount of clients, obviously, and you gain a lot of clients, and if that mix is a little bit off from what we project, you can get checks being a little bit more moderate than we expected. By the way, when I say that, I\u2019m talking about a tenth--I\u2019m not talking about four or three, I\u2019m talking about being off by one-tenth in what you project, so it was a little bit lighter there. Sure had a good quarter, but Sure really wasn\u2019t driving that result. Sara Gubins : Okay, great. Then just last question, do you by any chance have the number of payroll days in fiscal \u201917 versus \u201916? Efrain Rivera : The number of what, I\u2019m sorry? Martin Mucci : Payroll days. Sara Gubins : Number of payroll days. Efrain Rivera : In \u201917? Sara Gubins : Yes. Efrain Rivera : No, not yet. I think we\u2019re going to have one less than--one less day. I shouldn\u2019t say no and then I give you the answer. The answer is one less than next year. One less than this year, just to clarify. Sara Gubins : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. We show no further questions at this time. Martin Mucci : All right. At this point, we\u2019ll close the call. If you\u2019re interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived until about May 2. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our third quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, and that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin. Martin Mucci : Thank you, and good morning, and thank you for joining us for our Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Call and Webcast. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market open, we released our financial results \u2013 excuse me, for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2016. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage. And we will file our Form 10-K by the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month. On today's call, I will review highlights for the fourth quarter in fiscal 2016 related to sales, operations, and product development areas. Efrain will review our fourth quarter fiscal 2016 financial results and discuss our fiscal 2017 guidance. And then, we'll open it up for your questions. We are pleased with our strong finish to fiscal 2016. Our momentum continued in the fourth quarter. Efrain will talk in more detail about the financial results, but I want to touch on a couple of key points. First, total revenue was up 9% in the quarter and 8% for the fiscal year, reaching nearly $3 billion, a new record for Paychex. Payroll service revenue continued to experience steady growth of 4% for fiscal 2016, driven by growth in client base and revenue per check. And our payroll client base finished this year at approximately 605,000 clients, the highest client growth in recent years. Solid sales execution during fiscal 2016, along with high client retention in excess of 82%, positively impacted our client base. Client retention was consistent with last year's record high retention. HRS revenue benefited from strong demand for our comprehensive human resource outsourcing services, as we once again realized double-digit growth in client worksite employees that we serve. In particular, our PEO has been an area of strong growth. In addition, our full-service Affordable Care Act product contributed to the HRS revenue increase. During fiscal 2016, we made significant enhancements to our Paychex Flex platform, which is our proprietary cloud-based human capital management, or HCM solution. Paychex Flex is a robust technology and service model that supports our clients for every phase of their employees' journey from recruiting to retirement. This model allows business owners and HR professionals to tailor a solution encompassing tools, capabilities, and services that meet the unique needs of their organization and employees. Earlier this year, we completed the integration of the remaining key HCM modules with Paychex Hiring, Paychex Time, and Paychex Benefits. We believe we also have the best in market mobility offerings for both administrative users and employee self-service that allows access to our HCM suite with a single mobile application. Paychex Flex continues to receive positive reviews evidenced by multiple awards and acknowledgement received throughout this year. Earlier in the year, we earned recognition from the Brandon Hall Group Excellence Awards for advancements in workforce management technology for small and mid-sized businesses; PC Magazine's review referred to Paychex Flex as excellent, calling it more robust and scalable than some of our competitors' platforms; and most recently in the quarter, we received a 2016 TekTonic Award from HRO Today for the best-in-class mobile and cloud-based technology suite for comprehensive integrated HCM services. We are very pleased by this recognition, and it supports our belief that Paychex Flex technology, combined with a unique mix of personalized flexible service options, sets us apart and provides great value to our clients. We remain committed to our investments in product development and technology to keep us a market leader. Sales execution during 2016 was strong, with another year of double-digit growth, especially within the mid-market space. We believe the value that our Flex platform provides is a key driver to this success. During fiscal 2016, we announced the acquisition of Advance Partners, who joined the Paychex team during the third quarter. Advance Partners offers customizable solutions to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding and outsourcing services. Advance Partners and its leadership team has already proven to be a great addition, with their positive results and opportunity for growth in the expanding staffing market. Throughout the year, we have continued our shareholder-friendly actions. We maintain a strong dividend yield; and in July of 2015, we increased our regular quarterly dividend by 11%. The dividend increase supports our history of providing exceptional shareholder value while continuing to make strategic investments for the long-term sustained growth of Paychex. We have also continued to repurchase Paychex stock and acquired an additional 2.2 million shares of common stock for $108 million in fiscal 2016. As of May 31, 2016, our stock price was over $54 per share. And that has a total return of over 102%, or 15% on an annualized basis, over the past five-year period. The regulatory landscape for HCM continues to get more complicated, making managing HR increasingly difficult. We strive to be a valuable resource to our clients to educate them on changes and assist them with compliance. Recently, new overtime rules were approved by the Department of Labor that will expand overtime protection to millions of workers. We are well-positioned to help our clients comply with these new regulations. Our advanced suite of time and attendance products, including web and mobile tools, can assist companies with the scheduling, tracking and reporting of time, which will be critical to managing this new regulation. In summary, I'm extremely proud of the leadership team and all of our employees of Paychex, who have continued to deliver great service and product solutions, resulting in continued high client satisfaction and continued high levels of client retention. We also continue to focus on providing leading-edge user-friendly technology and unique personalized service to our clients, while delivering solid, consistent top line growth, strong operating margins and excellent returns to our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Marty, and good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will make some forward-looking statements for the future events, and thus, involve some risks. Refer to the customary disclosures. As Marty indicated, we had a strong finish to 2016. I'll cover some of the key highlights for the quarter and for the fiscal year and then provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of our 2017 outlook. Total service revenue grew 9% for the quarter and 8% for the fiscal year. Interest on funds held for clients increased 14% for the fourth quarter to $12 million; and 9% for the fiscal year to $46 million. Increases were primarily the result of higher average interest rates earned. Average investment balances were up 1% for the fiscal year, showing a positive impact from client growth, which is offset by lower state unemployment insurance rates. Total expenses increased by 8% in the fourth quarter and by 7% for the fiscal year. These increases were mainly in compensation-related costs, resulting from higher wages and higher performance-based comp. Strong growth in our PEO also contributed to the increases. Advance Partners contributed approximately 1% of the growth in total expenses for the fourth quarter, but less than 1% for the fiscal year. Operating margin was 36% for the fourth quarter and 38% for fiscal 2016. Operating income net of certain items increased 10% to $264 million for the fourth quarter and 9% to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2016. Our effective tax rate was 34.3% for the year compared to 36.3% for fiscal 2015. This is due to software production tax benefits, as we've discussed in prior calls. In our first quarter, we recognized a discrete item in the form of a tax benefit derived on income from prior years related to customer-facing software we produced. This discrete item was the largest \u2013 had the largest impact on the effective tax rate. While we have ongoing benefits of the impact, it's not as significant. Net income growth increased 11% to $178 million for the fourth quarter and 12% to $757 million for the fiscal year. Diluted EPS increased 11% to $0.49 per share for the fourth quarter and increased 13% to $2.09 per share for fiscal 2016. Net income diluted earnings per share would've increased 9% and 10%, respectively, without the discrete tax benefit recognized in the first quarter. Payroll service revenue increased 5% for the fourth quarter and 4% for the fiscal year. We benefited from increases in revenue per check and client base. Revenue per check was positively impacted by price increases, partially offset by discounts. Fiscal 2016 also benefited from two additional processing days during the year; one day in the first quarter, and one day in this quarter, fourth quarter. The extra days added approximately 0.5% to total payroll revenue, as did the acquisition of Advance. HRS revenue increased 14% to $311 million for the fourth quarter and 13% to $1.2 billion for the fiscal year. Paychex' HR Services continued to experience solid growth in clients and client worksite employees served. The PEO, in particular, contributed double-digit growth in client worksite employees served. Insurance services revenue growth benefited from continued growth of our ACA product and an increase in health and benefit applicants. The workers' compensation portion continued to grow with higher average premiums and growth in clients. Advance Partners contributed approximately a little bit less than 2% to growth in HRS revenue for the fourth quarter and approximately 1% to fiscal year growth. Investments and income. Our primary goal, as you know, continues to be to protect principal and to optimize liquidity. Combined portfolios, including both short-term investments and long-term investments, have earned an average rate of return of 1.1% for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year. We did see moderate benefit from the 25 basis point increase by the Federal Reserve on a short-term portion of our portfolio, but our long-term portfolio as of May 31, 2016, has an average yield-to-maturity of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.1 years, fairly unchanged from last year. Average investment balances for our client funds were flat for the quarter and up 1% for the fiscal year. While client growth positively impacted our average balances, this was offset by the impact of lower state unemployment insurance rates this year. The average invested balances for our corporate funds were down 9% for the year, largely due to the cash outflow for the business acquisition as well as share repurchases. I'll now walk you through the highlights on our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $793 million as of May 31, 2016, and no debt. Our cash flows from operations hit a milestone, exceeding $1 billion for the fiscal year, 14% higher than last year. Our net income, non-cash adjustments, and favorable working capital changes all contributed to the increase. Funds held for clients as of May 31, 2016 were $4 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31, 2015. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $4.1 billion for the fiscal year, a year-over-year increase of approximately 1%. Our total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of $48 million as of May 31, 2016, compared to $14 million as of the end of last year. Total stockholders' equity was $1.9 billion as of May 31, reflecting $607 million in dividends paid during the fiscal year. Dividends paid represented 80% of net income. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a sterling 40%. Now let's turn to guidance for fiscal 2017. I'd like to remind you that the guidance and our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions, continuing without significant changes. Payroll service revenue was projected to increase approximately 4% compared to fiscal 2016. The projected growth is based on an anticipated client base growth and increases in revenue per check. This growth is tempered by one less processing day in fiscal 2017. So, we'll have one less processing day this year, and that day will occur in the third quarter. So, I'll come back to that in a second. So, one less day, and it occurs in the third quarter. HRS revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 12% to 14%. Total service revenue is expected to increase in the range of 7% to 8%. Net income is expected to increase approximately 8%, excluding the impact of the discrete tax benefit recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. And that's important to bear in mind, when the two years are compared. Our operating income net of certain items as a percent of service revenue is expected to be approximately 38%. We anticipate a modest impact on leverage growth, as we are making investment in operations to support both mid-market and compliance solution services. So, I will get the question, and I'll answer it now. So, we don't anticipate \u2013 do we anticipate leverage? Yes, we do. We think it will be modest, because, as I just called out, we're making investments in \u2013 with operations and compliance service solutions to bolster and to support that growth. With respect to the quarters, as previously mentioned, there will be one less processing day in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Now let me get a little bit more granular, so you can fine-tune your model. Payroll revenue for the first and second quarters is expected to be at or above the full year guidance for payroll revenue. The third quarter, we expect to be below. I just mentioned we have one less day. It will be below the full year range. And then the fourth quarter, at this stage, we anticipate will be between 3% and 4%. So, just to reiterate, first and second quarters, we expect to be at or above the full year guidance for payroll revenue; third quarter, below, and fourth quarter between 3% and 4% at this point. HRS is expected to be within the full year guidance range, with the exception of the third quarter, which will fall below the full year range. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 is expected to be between 35.5% and 36%. Interest on funds is anticipated to be in the mid-single-digit range. We have not included any potential Fed fund rate increases in our guidance. I'd like to call out that when I reviewed consensus models, many of the numbers were close to what I'm reporting, but there was one important difference. Interest on funds held for clients was higher in the consensus models, and it looked like to the tune of about $0.01 to $0.02. We are not including any assumptions with respect to Fed rate rise increases. And as you well can appreciate, those look a lot more uncertain than they did even three weeks or four weeks ago. And then finally, with respect to EPS, we expect EPS in each of the quarters to be comparable, meaning pretty similar, with the following exceptions : First quarter, we expect will be modestly higher, and the third quarter, modestly lower; the third quarter, in particular, because of the one less day on payroll processing. So, that's the fine-tuning on the guidance. And then just want to make one final comment. It was about five years ago that Marty started to assemble the team that has led Paychex over the five-year period. And he set an ambitious goal. The goal was to hit $3 billion in revenue. That was an ambitious goal because when we finished 2011, we were growing 4%. This quarter, we're really on the cusp of that goal. It's an important milestone internally for us. Marty cited the returns for the past five years. We compared very favorably versus the S&P 500 and even against the S&P Technology Index. Those results are a testament to both employees, the executive team and to Marty's leadership. We're not the kind of people who brag or smack-talk, but we're quietly very, very pleased that we're on the cusp of that milestone, but we're also grounded enough to understand that we have to earn the trust of our clients, employees and our shareholders every day if we want to succeed. Every question you've asked in the last five years has caused us to think, to question and it's challenged us, and we've appreciated that. And yes, finally, we're not satisfied. We're hungry for more. And with that, I'll turn it over to Martin. Martin Mucci : Thank you, Efrain. I can't wait to close the call right there, but we'll open it up for questions and comments. Tessa? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] One moment please for incoming questions. The first question comes from Jason Kupferberg. Your line is now open. Jason Kupferberg : Hey. Good morning, guys. How are you? Efrain Rivera : Hi, Jason. Jason Kupferberg : Wanted to start with a question on core payroll and I appreciate all the quarterly color for the fiscal 2017. That's helpful. I'm assuming that the first half of the year being above the full year guidance is largely because of Advance and then obviously you've got the headwind in Q3 from one less day, and then you mentioned Q4 being 3% to 4%, which I think would not be burdened by processing days or by Advance. So it seems like kind of a cleaner number. I'm just trying to think sort of medium-term-ish harkening back to the Analyst Day last year and with that, would that imply or would it be fair to infer that then that 3% to 4% run rate is something that's realistic to sustain assuming no other acquisitions or typical fluctuations in processing days? Efrain Rivera : Jason, so I think that is a fair number. The only caveat I would add to that is that what that number that we're giving on payroll suggests is. We're just not getting an uplift from checks per payroll, which if you went back two years ago, we were getting 2%-plus on checks per payroll, combination of \u2013 small commendation of mix, but just very, very, very modest assumptions on checks per payroll just don't contribute to payroll revenue growth. So I think it's somewhere in that range. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. And still 2% to 4% on pricing for payroll this year? Efrain Rivera : Yes, yes, yes. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Understood. And then just switching over to leverage, I mean that color on the reinvestments this year is helpful. Is there anything we should be thinking about also, though, in terms of mix shift? I mean I'm thinking about areas like PEO which are obviously growing very well for you but presumably carries lower margin percentage. So when we think about the ability for the business over multiple years to drive meaningful operating margin expansion, is that an inhibitor? Is it big enough? Efrain Rivera : Really not. You know what, I'd just say if you look at our results this year, our leverage down to the EBIT line was about 100 basis points. So we had a pretty good year in terms of leverage. Now what you're seeing there is the fact that \u2013 two things that are implicit there. Number one, we had a really good year in mid-market sales. In some areas, our win rates were really, really, really strong. And as we look into the year we did two things this year. In 2016, we added to the mid-market sales force, which we don't typically do mid-year but we did. And as we added to the mid-year sales force, we were also transforming the service model. So we've made a lot of changes on the service model to improve service to mid-market clients and just in anticipation of that growth, we decided that it was important to have a year where we'll put more money into bolstering our service there. So that's what's happened. I think it's really kind of more of a one-year to two-year thing than a long-term issue in terms of affecting leverage. And finally to your point, PEO is just not big enough to really move the needle yet. It could if it really grew significantly beyond where it is now, but not affecting it now. Jason Kupferberg : And just last one for me, can I get your perspective on where we are in the ACA cycle? What's assumed in the fiscal 2017 HRS guidance for ACA versus what the contribution looked like in fiscal 2016? Because obviously the overall guide for HRS is calling for steady growth. Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think, well obviously today's a big filing day, and it's been certainly a complicated process. And probably the most complicated is just helping clients through the process, what was needed and especially those clients that came in kind of later in taking the product. But, an outstanding job by the employee teams that have been working on it and we feel pretty good about the filing that we're doing. And a lot of work, by the way, with the IRS too, our compliance team's working with the IRS for this first year of real, true filing. I think you'll see some of that sales, obviously there was a lot of upfront sales, and I think you'll see some of that slowdown some. However, when you think about how many new clients come in to us every year, we think we'll have a great attachment rate of that product that really is necessary. And one of the costs, as Efrain said, with the investment in the mid-market, one of those costs is continuing to invest in the ACA support because as we've learned, as we've gone through, this requires even more support of the clients and the filing requirements, and a little more technology to kind of help the clients through the process. So I feel good about it, it's been a tough number of months to get through this, but we're excited on the filing date and the additional investments we're going to make. Efrain Rivera : Hey, so, and Jason, on the other question. This year, ACA compliance services were, contributed less than 1% of the growth in revenue. Next year really is pretty negligible in terms of growth. If there's some, I should say it's not zero, but most of the clients, the bulk of the clients that needed the service signed up, and a number of them will probably understand that they needed it and we'll have some additional clients. But we've absorbed that headwind, if you will, that modest headwind into our guidance and feel pretty comfortable about where revenues is going to land next year. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Thanks for the comments. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Danyal Hussain. Your line is now open. Danyal Hussain : Hi, Marty and Efrain. Thanks for taking the question. Just, this is a follow-up on leverage. I guess it sounds like a lot of the investment is one-time or sort of catch-up in nature, or maybe anticipatory in nature. But is the go-forward operating leverage in that model? Is it more service-oriented, and so is it lower going forward? Efrain Rivera : No, I don't think so. I think two things. One is you only go through a Flex transition a few times in a technology cycle, so frankly, it's a byproduct of the success we are having selling Flex. So it's not a change to the model, it's really, frankly, the success we're having in the mid-market, requiring \u2013 in our world, bolstering our service a bit. So that technology and that service is scalable as you grow clients initially the way we are now, we just have to scale up the service component of it. So it's more short-term in nature. Danyal Hussain : Got it. And to that point, actually, on Flex, so if you think about R&D spend, given the changes you've gone through and the products that recently \u2013 are we at the point now where maybe you can start to see more leverage on that cost? Or is there maybe not as much opportunity given how much you have to update with ACA? Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think we're at \u2013 well, there's always continued investment, but I think we are at a pretty good place for the level of IT spend in R&D, and so I think, you'll gain something there, but we won't be going up much in that spend, I don't think, but you won't see it necessarily go down a lot, either. So it will be a pretty good steady place there. I think what Efrain has talked about the most is we're gearing up for some of the service. As you add it all, if we added all these products, we're changing some of our service models and we're putting more technology in self-service for the client, so there's some things that they can do, there's more things they can do if they want to, or they can still come into the payroll specialist or other teams. And, so I think IT is at a pretty good spend rate, and they'll continue to go up, but not as much as they have in the past, because we got to a pretty good place with the level of investment. Danyal Hussain : Perfect, thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. David Togut : Thanks. Good morning. Given your commentary about the mid-market sales force, can you quantify your anticipated growth in the sales force for fiscal 2017 as a whole? And if you could call out any variations versus overall growth by segment, that would be helpful. Efrain Rivera : Yeah, so I'll talk to that and then let Marty give some more comment on it. So David, this year, we had pretty strong growth, actually even a little bit higher than we had planned on the payroll services side, which would include mid-market. And as I mentioned, we had pretty healthy growth in mid-market sales adds. So overall, we're still going to be in the 2% to 3% growth range this year, but that's because in payroll services last year, we were between 5% and 6%. So some of those adds were done in anticipation of this year. And we add selectively to certain sales forces. You've heard in previous calls, for example, that when a year or so ago, a year-and-a-half, we added mid-year to PEO and that paid some dividends. So each year, we're taking a look at where we think there's opportunities and adding selectively to the sales force. Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think it's consistent growth, as Efrain said. And because we added \u2013 and we were very happy with the fact that we added kind of mid-year particularly in that mid-market area earlier than normal. So instead of making sure we were staffed up to begin this fiscal year, we actually added probably three months earlier than normal into the mid-market because of the demand, which was a really good thing. But you'll see overall I think the growth will be in that normal kind of 3% range. And we add a little bit to all of them, but mostly, as Efrain said, it's in the payroll space, and particularly in the mid-market. David Togut : Thank you. And then for 2017, what's your anticipated client portfolio growth, total balances? Efrain Rivera : Okay. So that could mean two things, David. Do you mean client count, or client balance growth? David Togut : About client balance growth. Efrain Rivera : I would say it's probably in the 2% to 3% range. Unless \u2013 so assuming rates were lower this year, and it's a little bit tough to anticipate, but I'm just assuming it will be wage growth and not \u2013 there won't be a change in any of the other balance figures. David Togut : Got it. And then in the fourth quarter, total client count growth was 2.5%. If we strip out Advance Partners, is 1.3% a fair assessment of organic client count growth? Efrain Rivera : All right \u2013 Advance had no impact on the client count growth. David Togut : Got it. And then... Martin Mucci : Yeah, the payroll client. That's the payroll client base, and for the year, what we were saying was it was over 2%. Efrain Rivera : Yeah. Martin Mucci : 2% for the year. David Togut : Got it. Just a quick final question. What dividend growth rate would you anticipate in July when the board announces a new rate for the year ahead? Efrain Rivera : That's a good question. So we'll let them talk about that, but I'd just give two pieces of guidance. We've said we like to keep it in that low-80%s range as a percentage of net income, and we'd like it to track income, yeah. So it will be somewhere in that range. David Togut : Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Martin Mucci : All right, David. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Gary Bisbee. Your line is now open from RBC Capital Markets. Gary Bisbee : Hey, guys. Good morning. Efrain Rivera : Hey, Gary. Martin Mucci : Hi, good morning. Gary Bisbee : So help me understand one thing. As I look at the guidance and then I think about how you've talked about the business in the last year, so you've got the best client growth since 2007, you're at record retention again this year, you've had a real ramp in bookings the last two years, float's no longer a big drag, you've got seven months of the acquisition in the upcoming year versus five months in the year you just finished. I really struggle to understand why revenue wouldn't accelerate at least modestly, and the guidance implies none. So is there something else going on like less pricing? It just feels like something doesn't add up here with the simple math. And I did hear you clearly that the checks per client is not as big a driver as it's been in the past, but it just feels like there should be some acceleration, given how strong you've been performing. Efrain Rivera : Well I'd say the first thing I'd mentioned is part of the answer to that, Gary. So checks per client, when they go flat to modestly negative because the client mix, you end up having an impact on payroll service growth, number one. Number two, it is, it's not seven months, it's actually about six months\u2019 worth of revenue that we'll get from Advance. So although that's a pretty minor number, it's not quite as much as you're suggesting. And I think there's more, I think what we'd recognize as we've gone through the year is that the higher the client growth, and we've set pretty ambitious goals again next year, it'll be between 2% and 3%, initially that comes at some impact in terms of what you're expecting on overall pricing. So we recoup that over time, but as you grow, and this has been the history of the company prior to the recession, you pay a little bit of a price on checks and also on overall rate based on what's happening with client growth. So it's all of that. And then the third thing that I would say, which you're not factoring in, is we had a nice bump, uplift from the ACA compliance product. And while I had mentioned I think earlier in response to Jason's question that we absorbed it in the guidance, of course, we're not having that uplift in growth this year that we had last year. So if you stripped all of that out, you'd see underlying acceleration. We're obviously not going to detail all of that out to get to the guidance. So those are the factors that affect the overall rate. Gary Bisbee : Okay. Thanks. Efrain Rivera : I'm sorry, one other thing by the way. Sorry about that, Gary. We have one less day in the year. So that's the other part of payroll service growth. So all of those things imply if you made [indiscernible] I won't put you through the pain of doing, you'd see that we're actually accelerating a bit. Gary Bisbee : Okay. That's helpful. And then a question on Flex. Just how does the product roadmap look from here? You've talked in prior quarters about some of the major components that were added this last fiscal year. Are there more big pieces to the puzzle that need to be integrated or added? And then also, as part of that, where are you now in terms of migration of customers? Martin Mucci : Yes. On the Flex product, I think, Gary, we've got most of everything, the main pieces in there, particularly the paperless on-boarding and recruiting and the benefits administration now that came in from BeneTrac that we integrated in. So we feel pretty good. I think there's always other components that we're looking at competitively to see if we need to add, but for the most part, kind of the vast majority of everything is in now, and integrated on a kind of single employee record, which is working well for the sales and so forth. The vast majority of our clients have, are on the Flex platform. And so while we continue to work on some of the mid-market, the vast majority of the clients are already on Flex and there isn't a migration that's needed from that standpoint. So I think we're in good shape with people on Flex. And they are gaining, anyone on Flex is gaining all the mobility additions. So a lot of work now is going to making mobility and the online visibility into a simpler, easier to use, more HTML5 kind of language. Also the options for, we haven't talked about it, but the options for Spanish, we've really put most everything in Spanish now and we're seeing a nice uptick in sales to Hispanic businesses, which has been a focus for us the last few years from both the sales and service perspective. So I think what you'll see now is not as much product functionality that's missing as it is the look, the feel, and the mobility piece of it. And by the way, everything's being developed now here mobile-first. So basically you make it simple so that almost everything can be done on the phone, and then it grows more complex online. Gary Bisbee : Great. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Sara Gubins with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Sara Gubins : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Efrain Rivera : Good morning, Sara. Sara Gubins : Within payroll service for the client count growth, I'm wondering if you're able to assess how much of the growth is coming from new business formation in the last year versus taking share of existing businesses. Efrain Rivera : Yeah. I don't have a precise number on that Sara, but I can say that in the fourth quarter, sales to newly-formed businesses were up about 10% from the quarter before. We had a pretty nice bump. So I think we're getting some uplift from being, I think one, probably more competitive there and second from a little bit better business environment. Sara Gubins : Okay. And then in terms of the client mix shift, given the fast growth in PEO, the ACA tailwind, and Paychex Flex. Are you seeing the client mix shifting more towards companies with over 50 employees? Efrain Rivera : No, no. Actually, I think I mentioned in a previous call, and we'll put out the exact number to the right decimal in the 10-K, but our average client size is \u2013 was 17. We may have ended the year at 16.92 or 16.95. No significant change. I think we continue to have strong mid-market sales. I would expect that number may go up. But this year was a little bit anomalous in that it skewed a little bit lower. But tiny, but it moves the needle. Sara Gubins : Okay. And then just last question on M&A. You've talked in the past about being interested in doing some larger M&A. What does the landscape look like? Is that something that's on the horizon in fiscal 2017? Martin Mucci : Yes, we're still pretty active and we've got probably one of the better pipelines we've had. Still looking, the decision is the value and the fit, and we're very selective about what we've acquired. We've done more acquisitions in the last five years than I think probably any time in history, and we felt very good about each one of those, whether from SurePayroll to now Advance Partners. So I think we're still very active in it. It's hard to say whether things will come to fruition or not, but we feel good about the pipeline that's out there and the activity that we're involved in right now. Sara Gubins : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Rick Eskelsen : Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I guess just following up earlier on the Flex question. Can you talk a little bit about how the client uptake has been on the newer modules that you've rolled out? Martin Mucci : Yes, it's \u2013 I think it's been good. Particularly the time and attendance piece of it as we've integrated it in, and the mobility functionality that's with it where you can punch in, punch out and so forth, I think, has been probably the most popular, and I think that's because you see the overtime rules that have been approved now, and that will be enacted soon. I think a lot of a number of clients are now looking at time and attendance as something they really have to have and they're looking at great options like ours. I think the electronic basically paperless on-boarding and recruiting of new employees has been good. It's relatively new, and getting the sales teams to make sure it's in that first proposal has probably been more of a challenge, so we'll get it all in there. But I think that one has got a tremendous opportunity in front of it, I think we're starting to really capture that now, a few months into \u2013 after the release of it. Rick Eskelsen : Thanks. And then just with your success in the mid-market and the team selling that you've talked about a lot recently. Is there like an average number of modules that clients are taking currently, and how might that compare to the last couple of years? Are you seeing that number going up? Martin Mucci : It definitely is going up because we can see it from a revenue per unit standpoint. We've seen a nice uptick over the years of revenue per unit. So more clients are taking the products upfront, particularly with the integrated selling approach, and that's kind of in all sizes of clients. Mid-market right down to I'd say, 10 to 15 employees even. There's much more of an acceptance of taking more modules, and there's much more of a need for it, and so the value has been much greater. I don't know if I'd really, if there's really an average number, but it definitely has increased the revenue per unit, and we're good at both, I think we're much better now at the integrated selling of selling net value upfront that we've talked about. And then as we go on, if the clients don't have it, we have a great team that comes kind of \u2013 back around to the clients and said, hey, now that you have, let's say payroll and time and attendance, let's talk about benefit administration and, so that can help you in Affordable Care Act and everything else that we offer. So definitely the attachment has been a big part of our \u2013 a big assistance to our growth rate. Rick Eskelsen : Last question, just following up on Sara's question on M&A. What areas are you looking at most? Is it things to add in payroll and HRS? Are you looking at some of the adjacent and other business areas you've talked about in the past? Thanks. Martin Mucci : Yeah, I'd say we're always looking at payroll. There's opportunities out there for that, and we're looking also at product additions, tuck-in for product, but we've got most of that now, but we're always looking for that. And then of course all the areas that we're in, whether it be 401(k), PEO business, we're always looking at those opportunities as well. And then always looking at outside the country as well, what other opportunities are there for us. It's just a matter of, as I said, we've never been probably more active or a longer pipeline, but the valuations are still relatively high, and we're very selective as to what we go forward with. But I would say all of the above we're interested in. As long as they're a good fit and are good for both obviously for the company and for our shareholders, we look to go forward with it. Rick Eskelsen : Thank you very much. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Kartik Mehta : Thank you. Hey. Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Efrain Rivera : Good morning, Kartik. Kartik Mehta : Efrain, any thoughts on how you might manage the flowed portfolio considering we're in a little bit of a different environment than we were a few months ago? Have you changed your thoughts on that at all? Efrain Rivera : It's interesting you say that, Kartik. So as I was driving in this morning, I was trying to figure out what happens if we're in an environment where the Fed doesn't raise during the year and at this stage haven't decided to make any changes, but it's certainly is something that we'd have to look at the duration of the portfolio if the yield curve looks the way it is now over time. And no decisions on that, but that's something we'll have some discussions on as we go through the quarter. It's just, as you can imagine, it's pretty dizzying trying to figure out what the right scenario is when I would say three months ago, we were thinking there might be as many as three raises in the next \u2013 in the fiscal year, and now it looks increasingly like if you get one, that will be a lot. Maybe zero. So, yeah, we're thinking about how to create the right portfolio structure without increasing risk. Kartik Mehta : And, Marty, you talked a little bit about Flex, and obviously Flex is a much better product for your clients and you talked a little bit about maybe trying to sell more value-added services. It seems like that's just starting. Could you see Flex because of your ability to sell other value-added products or what you've at least seen so far, help kind of accelerate the revenue growth rate for the payroll business? Martin Mucci : Well, we certainly hope so. I mean, what we've seen is more revenue per client and we've seen that consistently, and that's because the Flex platform allows that integration of various product bundles of different functionality within a single employee record and that it also allows you to have access to the mobile app, which has been very popular. So I think the opportunity is there. I mean, when we look out, obviously, as far as we can go as the guidance that we look at pretty closely that Efrain has detailed, and so we certainly hope the opportunity is there. We're keeping it and we're, I think, very, very competitive with it, and that certainly is our hope. Efrain Rivera : I mean, the other thing, Kartik, I'd like to add that is important and I think I've mentioned this after the third quarter doing a number \u2013 in a number of comments, it's important to remember that when we sell Flex, a portion of that revenue is payroll, and a lot of it's reported in HRS. So I cautioned that while we're not walking away from looking at payroll revenue as an important part of the revenue growth of the company, increasingly, when we sell Flex, a portion of that is reported in HRS. So all of the discussions we've talked about, modules like time and attendance, HR administration, expense management, applicant tracking and recruiting, employee shared responsibility or ACA, those are all recorded in HRS. So you need to look at both pieces to really kind of get a complete assessment of how we're doing. Martin Mucci : Yeah, we think of it more kind of in total service revenue because it does, obviously, it bleeds over into both of them. Kartik Mehta : That's fair. And just for a last question, now that you've owned Advance Partners for a few months, and that was a business that you were excited about in the beginning, I'm just wondering, is that something that still is what you expected? And is that a business that you could potentially acquire other businesses to get additional scale? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think so. In fact, we feel they've been performing extremely well and the whole leadership team has come with the company, so we're excited about that. And so they performed well. We have already been looking for opportunities to increase the scale there and have a few kind of in the pipeline that we're looking at. And, yeah, we think, we're very pleased with the first six months of how that's been going and the results that they have, and, of course, the tie-in into our clients that have a number of opportunities for them and some opportunities from their clients for us. So we're very pleased with the acquisition and the team there and how we're off to a good start. Kartik Mehta : Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Martin Mucci : All right, Kartik. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital. Your line is now open. Jeffrey Silber : Thanks so much. I know you're mostly a U.S.-centric focused company, but I'm just curious in terms of the impact of Brexit, if at all. Would this maybe preclude you from potentially expanding in that region, if you think it will have any impact on your U.S. business at all? Thanks. Martin Mucci : Yeah, this is Marty. I don't think so. We don't see much there. We're mostly, outside the US we're mostly in Germany, and then we have the Brazil startup there. So we don't see it. Obviously, from an acquisitions standpoint, there are opportunities there that we would be probably a little more cautious about given kind of the uncertainty over a longer period of time. But right in the short term, certainly, it has very little, if any, impact on us, at least from the UK perspective. Jeffrey Silber : Okay. And then just a couple of numbers-related questions. You mentioned the investments in growth this year. On the expense side, would that be on an operating expense line item, SG&A or a combination? Efrain Rivera : It's mostly operating expenses, Jeff. Jeffrey Silber : Okay. And then, sorry, just one more. Efrain Rivera : That's okay. Jeffrey Silber : I'm sorry, on the fourth quarter, you had negative investment income. Can you just walk us through what happened? Efrain Rivera : I was waiting for that. You get the gold star for that question, Jeff. So the answer is we had some small investments that we wrote down the value, didn't write them off, but wrote down the value when we looked at it in the portfolio. Very small things. But the way we record that is in that line, so that's why it went negative a little bit. Jeffrey Silber : Do you know what the EPS impact of that was or... Efrain Rivera : Very modest. Maybe half a cent, if that much. Jeffrey Silber : Okay. Great. All right. Appreciate the color. Thanks so much. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Yes. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from David Grossman, Stifel Financial. Your line is now open. David Grossman : Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Martin Mucci : Hi, David. David Grossman : I was hoping, maybe, Marty, if you can stretch your comments about the middle market. It seems you're doing well. And as you probably know, there are several others claiming prosperity in that segment as well. How much of that may be ACA-driven or other fundamental factors in the marketplace? And obviously you've done a lot to invest in that segment over the last several years, and just curious if there are other factors at work there that may be driving the market clients to go to an outsourced solution? Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think definitely a number of them. One, I think the need, the complications of compliance with all of the regulations have increased. So you have ACA, but you have the recently done overtime regulations. You have paid leave now for families you have got to keep track of. You have a lot more immigration and keeping track of who your employees are and all of that that you have to be backed up with. And the enforcement of the rules we see are stronger. So more businesses are being impacted by audits, by investigations, by are you following the rules correctly. And because states and the Feds are also looking for more revenue sources, so states can go after things. So I think that whole regulation side has become increasingly more complex at a lower level. So we're seeing people, we're seeing clients buy time and attendance that normally were probably 40 employees and higher 30, PEO tended to be higher, now it's coming down lower, they're looking for help with insurance and benefit plans because they have to be more competitive. The other second thing would be the market is more competitive now for employees as you get closer to lower unemployment and full employment. And so people need more help with having more competitive benefits, more competitive recruiting tools, being able to recruit online, paperless, attract new employees. And I think, there was another one there I was thinking about. And I think, the acceptance of cloud-based technology and having and getting away from desktop and on-premise solutions has rapidly increased the last three years to four years, but we're still seeing that increase where years ago, people wanted to do more things themselves, worry about the security. Now, they want to trust their security of information with a third-party outsourcer, kind of totally reversed from five years or six years ago. Now they trust that Paychex is large enough and a big enough IT security team that they're going to do their best to protect their information where I used to have to do it inside. So I think there's just a big push of regulations, compliance, and the need, therefore, pushing down to a lower level. And so we're seeing that that mid-market that I would say used to be 50 to 500 or 1000 has really pushed down to maybe 15 or 20. To 500 is a real sweet spot right now that has a lot of focus. David Grossman : So, with the product set that you have now, obviously they're at one point historically, that was a limiting factor for you and the mid-market itself. Any appetite to go after a bigger client or a bigger client service segment of the market? Or do you feel you'd rather just sit below the radar screen where others may define the mid-market? Martin Mucci : Yeah, it never feels like we're below radar, but I think there's \u2013 that the real sweet spot of what has taken off and made many companies at least appear to do well, and I know how we're doing well, is really even that 15 or 20 to 500. I mean, we were still selling anywhere from one employee to 1000, but I would say the hottest area right now is 20 to 250 or 20 to 500. Those are the clients that really have been pushed with much more regulation and need for the products, and are now much more open to outsourcing. So I think we feel good about the opportunity that's ahead of us, that that's going to drive our growth, and it also allows us to really focus on those markets. That's a pretty huge market, 1 to 1000. And we feel pretty good that, hey, we're very focused on that, and that's who we provide the best service and the best products to. David Grossman : Got it. And then maybe just one quick numbers question, and Efrain, I'm sorry if I missed this, but when you take both the Advance piece and the loss of the processing day, what is the net impact on next year's revenue? Efrain Rivera : So, the loss of the processing day, didn't call that out specifically, David, but it's, I'd say, probably about 25 basis points. Advance is about probably another 25 basis points. David Grossman : So, it nets to zero? Efrain Rivera : Yeah. David Grossman : All right, guys. Thanks very much. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from James Schneider, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Efrain Rivera : Hey, Jim. James Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe talk about the \u2013 on the HR Services growth forecast, whether \u2013 anything specific in terms of product-specific drivers you can call out contributing to the growth? And you've talked about time maintenance and HR administration as being drivers in the past. Anything notable to call out, as far as the FY 2017 guidance is concerned? Martin Mucci : I think, PEO, we haven't talked as much about that, but I think, PEO is still very strong. And that \u2013 part of that is supported by \u2013 or helped by the need for insurance support and benefit plans and so forth. So, we still see that growing very well. Worksite employees are double-digit growth again. And so, I think, the PEO and ASO, both models are continuing to grow well. 401(k) has been very steady. And we've \u2013 I think, we've talked about the fact that we went after larger \u2013 what we call large-market or higher-asset clients. And we feel that, that's got a great opportunity as well. A lot of things kick around about 401(k)s and so forth, but we're still doing very well, really introducing some more 401(k) record-keeping plans than anybody else. And we've got a solid sales and service team that really do very well there. So, the sales have been consistent, the client growth very consistent in 401(k). And the retention this year, probably the best it's been in our history. So, I think, all those components, we don't talk to as much, but they've been steady and real good components of the growth. James Schneider : Thanks. And maybe \u2013 could you just maybe comment at a broad level about the level of discounting you're seeing in the market right now, and maybe whether there's more pressure or less pressure than there was, say, a year ago, and if so, in what segment? Martin Mucci : Yeah. I think, it's a little bit more pressure, probably. I think with more competitors and so forth, it's not a big change in the competitive environment, believe it or not. For the number that are out there, we all seem to be doing well. But, I think, there's a little more pressure on price. And on the low end, there's a little more pressure, because, I think, as new businesses \u2013 as Efrain said, the new businesses have kind of come back, and so when you have new businesses that start up, there's always a little pressure to \u2013 for them to first kind of outsource and go to someone to do their payroll, and maybe their payroll and time and attendance. There's a little more price pressure to get them in started, but remember, that we then roll-off a lot of times the discount for a period of time. So, I think, a little bit more pressure there, but nothing that would be major at this point. James Schneider : Got it. Thanks. And then maybe quick clarification. The 8% net income guidance for fiscal 2017, does that include or exclude the tax benefit you saw in fiscal 2016? Efrain Rivera : That's excluding that benefit break. So, yeah, I called that out, so it's important to remember. James Schneider : Got it. Thank you very much. Efrain Rivera : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Marcon, R.W. Baird. Your line is now open. Mark Marcon : Hi. Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Martin Mucci : Hi, Mark. Mark Marcon : Hey, Marty. First of all, nobody else said it, but great job over the last five years for you and the team. Martin Mucci : Oh, thank you, Mark. Appreciate that. Efrain went off script there, so, I appreciate it. It's a great team, very proud of the team. Mark Marcon : So, a few questions. First of all, with regards to the mid-market, has there been any discernible change in the pace in terms of bookings growth, the pipeline, post this kind of \u2013 on the mid-market, a little bit of the ACA surge in that over-50 employee segment? Martin Mucci : I \u2013 there certainly has been sales growth. That's, as Efrain and I said, that's where we added nice percent of the sales force mid-year, which is rare for us. We felt the opportunity was so good with the Flex product and all the additional modules that we added. So, sales, for me have been definitely stronger. I think, the other thing you may have mentioned... Mark Marcon : I'm just saying like post the calendar year transition and that surge of activity, the clients that may have come on just because it's like, okay, we're scrambling to get ready for this. Now that, that scramble is over, are you seeing any sort of change in the pace? Martin Mucci : No, not really. No. Okay, no, not \u2013 we really haven't. I mean, those \u2013 and that's why we felt good about having those additional sales reps in place there, because we're still seeing a strong demand. And I think it's all the things that I mentioned earlier that \u2013 why we're seeing that. So, no, we feel very good. And the other thing is mid-market, as I might \u2013 I think, I mentioned earlier. It's funny, it used to be that kind of 50-line for us, but I think you're seeing a lot of what you could call mid-market demand anyway is kind of gotten down to an even lower size. And so \u2013 and that momentum has picked up, and that gives you a lot of opportunity to sell more products if they need more. Mark Marcon : Great. And then can you talk a little bit about the \u2013 what the right level of leverage expectations beyond this year would likely be, like how do we think about that relative to the normal historical pattern? Efrain Rivera : Yeah, so, Mark, I... Mark Marcon : And ex float. Efrain Rivera : Yeah, ex float. So, we, this year, ex float, we were at about 50 basis points of leverage, which is what we typically do in a given year. We'll be less than that next year for the reasons that I called out. Mark Marcon : Yeah. Efrain Rivera : But I still think that going forward, we're going to try to be in that 50-plus basis point leverage range. And if we can't hit that in a given year, then we're going to have a specific reason why we can't. In this case, we had a lot of discussions internally about do we add the resources that \u2013 both in compliance services, as I mentioned earlier, and in mid-market. And it was pretty clear that given the amount of growth we had to do that. But I don't think that's going to happen every single year, but it was important this year. But I don't think it changes long term, the trajectory of building plans that include 50 basis point plus, because that's the way we go into our planning cycles. And we think it's doable. It's hard, it takes a lot of work, but we think it's doable. Mark Marcon : Great. Can you talk about the opportunity to go in and sell some of the newer modules, the newer solutions to some of the older, existing clients in the mid-market? What's \u2013 how much runway do you have there in terms of upselling some of those existing clients? Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think, still quite a bit of room. When you think about the penetration, these products really haven't been \u2013 many of our products, even HR administration online, and time and attendance online are older. Time and attendance product really haven't been around that long. It's been more of the last three years to four years, maybe five years tops, then we track a little bit longer in benefits admin. So, there's room there. And I think, as they see the benefit of Flex and the mobility that comes with it, the mobile options, and the whole different look and feel to it, I think, that helps sell them, along with if there's many more product modules available to you, and the fact that it's really with one single employee record. I think that is pulling a lot of clients in, where five years ago, we would've said, a, you have Payroll, and you have other modules, but they're not fully integrated. Now, there's much more of a pull from the clients [indiscernible]. So, I think, we've got some nice opportunity still in the mid-market. Selling new, we're selling much more integrated upfront and better attachment rates, but there's still a lot of room, which we \u2013 and we do that. We attack, we go back into the base to sell them the value-added features that they need. Mark Marcon : Are you doing that with the regular sales force, or is there a kind of a gatherer group that kind of goes into existing clients? Martin Mucci : Yeah, it's a mix. We have both kind of a virtual sales that go back into the base as well. But those existing reps who have the relationships and so forth will also \u2013 and with the clients, will go back and sell it. So, both can sell. Mark Marcon : Great. And then just one numbers question. What's the net income base \u2013 the precise net income base that we should be using for the fiscal year that this was completed as a basis of comparison for the 8% net income growth for this coming year? Efrain Rivera : Good question, Mark. Let me post it, so I don't get the wrong number. I'll post it shortly. Okay? Mark Marcon : Okay. Great. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : In other words, just so everyone knows, look for it in the \u2013 either in the slides we'd put up, or if we've already posted them, which the team probably did, we'll just amend it to include that number. Okay? Mark Marcon : Excellent. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : And something off here, and that will be wrong, so... Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar, Citi. Your line is now open. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thank you. Hi, Martin. Hi, Efrain. Martin Mucci : Hi, Ashwin. Efrain Rivera : Hi, Ashwin. Ashwin Shirvaikar : So, I think, Mark just asked a question and you just answered this, the 8% net income guide. Then you said it excludes the $0.05 tax benefit. Efrain Rivera : That's correct, yup. Ashwin Shirvaikar : You're basically saying go off the adjusted lower EPS base, correct? Efrain Rivera : That's correct, yup. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Okay. And is there a specific factor that takes the tax rate down modestly this year? Efrain Rivera : This year? Ashwin Shirvaikar : It seems like your guidance was maybe 50 basis points lower. Efrain Rivera : Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah, it's a combination of two things. One is some work on state taxes that we have done; and also, the software tax credit change has a continuing impact going forward. So, it's the combination of both of those. And superior work for our tax group. But beyond that \u2013 but that's it. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Okay. I have a sort of a broader GDP sensitivity question. Efrain Rivera : Yeah. Ashwin Shirvaikar : So, when you look at the mix of business that you have now, which has a higher contribution \u2013 higher percent contribution from HRS, which to me, it basically says, a bigger share of wallet, and anytime you have a bigger share of wallet, it probably means a more stable client. You've got the bigger mid-market business, again, similar conclusion. You've got investment contribution that's almost a third of what it was going to the last downturn. So, how do you think of the potential impact of the downturn in economic expectations, should it happen? Martin Mucci : So if it should happen \u2013 I mean, I think, obviously, the biggest impact \u2013 if I get your question right, Ashwin, I think the biggest impact there would be new client growth. Because last \u2013 anytime a recessionary-type thing happens, it has impact on the payroll service revenue growth, because the clients either more go lost, because they can't sustain the business, and fewer start up. So, the client growth puts obviously a damper on that. I don't think we've definitely laid it out what exactly that would be. It doesn't always have an impact on the number of products they buy, because they typically buy those that bundle, let's say, because they need it for those that are staying in business. The biggest impact will be losses, client retention. And new business start-ups would be the biggest impact, I would say. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Okay. Got it. And we get a lot of questions on operating leverage. So, Efrain, you tried to clarify in your prepared remarks, but I still have a question. And that's it basically... Efrain Rivera : I expect no less, Ashwin. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Specific to technology spend, last year, I think, was the first time in many years that you've said basically that it's \u2013 the rate of growth is settling down, similar comment this year. Is this just the kind of market and client expectation that you have to keep that tech spend up, where you don't really get leverage from it, but it's clearly not hurting on operating margins, so you kind of \u2013 when you say steady the percent of revenue? Is it... Martin Mucci : Yes, I think, that's basically what I was trying to say earlier on that piece of it was it's not \u2013 for a while, that was \u2013 well, it was hurting margins a bit, but we were offsetting a lot of it with operational efficiencies. In driving those efficiency, those dollars kind of backed to IT for technology investment, and kind of resetting the level of technology spend versus the operational spend. And so now, we kind of feel like the technology spend got to a point where it's pretty normalized, it's in a good place, we don't see that going up dramatically. I don't necessarily see it going down, because there's always technology in our \u2013 and we want to stay on the leading edge, from a competitive standpoint. But \u2013 and then, there's not as much operational leverage, but we continue to, as Efrain said, we're going \u2013 we continue to try to look. It's kind of in our DNA here that we always are looking here. Revenue growth is x. We're always trying to look for 50 basis points or so to see if we can continue to leverage the business. And obviously, the better that growth rate is, the better opportunity we have to leverage, and that's a constant focus. Anything you want to add? Efrain Rivera : No. That makes sense. Martin Mucci : Okay. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Understood. That makes sense. So, that answers all my questions. Happy Fourth of July coming up here. Efrain Rivera : Yes, thanks. Hey, Ashwin. Before you go, so \u2013 and then to Mark's question, apologize, I didn't have the schedule right in front of me. So, net income excluding the tax event this year, the correct base is $738,600,000, in case I wasn't clear. Then we'll just post it to the website, too, and the schedules that we release shortly, if we haven't done it already. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Okay. Great. Thank you for that. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The last question comes from Lisa Ellis, Bernstein. Your line is now open. Lisa Ellis : Hi, guys. Just one quick one for me. Can you just talk about \u2013 with Advance, now that you're five months or six months into the acquisition, the role they're going to be playing in your portfolio, like are they a customer acquisition engine for you, where you'll be able to sell in your existing payroll and other services? Or how should we be thinking about that, both for Advance and then, I guess, future acquisitions like that? Martin Mucci : Yes, for them, as Efrain mentioned, they're really not in our client count, so \u2013 in our payroll client count that we always give for the over 600,000 clients. And \u2013 so, it's not so much about client acquisition, other than for themselves. So, we're looking for them to grow their revenue base through new clients, obviously, and selling more product to them. To us, it was broadening, really, the markets that we serve. So, here's a company that is profitable, is \u2013 had nice revenue growth, good leadership team, saw a lot of potential, and the staffing business that they support, those staffing companies, we saw is a growing market, and because there's continued more temporary help and staffing help that's going to be needed, I think particularly with overtime rules and so forth. So, we saw them as a component of the portfolio to grow revenue. There'll be some overlap between us, and the fact that we have a number of staffing companies that are payroll clients or other products, and so we'll look to refer. We're already doing that, looking to see if those staffing companies who were clients of us for payroll could be helped by payroll funding and other support from Advance. But I think, that's how we look at it, it's another opportunity to broaden our revenue growth, because we see staffing companies as a real growth opportunity. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Is that it, Tessa? Operator : Yes. We show no further questions at this time. Martin Mucci : All right. At this point, we will close the meeting. If you're interested in replaying the webcast for the conference call, this will be archived until August 1. Thank you for your interest in Paychex, and thank you for your participation in our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 earnings release call and webcast. We're very proud of our Paychex employees and the great fiscal year 2016 we had. And we're looking forward to another great year as we begin fiscal 2017. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today's conference. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded as well. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin. Martin Mucci : Thank you. And thank you for joining us for our discussion of Paychex's first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for first quarter ended August 31, 2016. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days, and you can access our earnings release and Form 10-Q on our Investor Relations webpage as they become available. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month. On today's call, I will review highlights for the first quarter in relation to sales and ops and product management development areas. Efrain will review first quarter financial results and discuss our full-year guidance, and then, we'll open it up to your questions. We're off to a solid start for fiscal 2017 with positive results across all major product lines. The number of client worksite employees served by our human resource outsourcing services grew by double digits on a year-over-year basis. Our cloud-based HCM services including time and attendance and human resource management continued to gain strong market acceptance in the quarter as well as last year. Payroll service revenue grew 4% for the first quarter. HRS revenue increased 15% for the quarter driven largely by growth in the client base across all major HCM categories. Total service revenue, up 9%. We acquired Advance Partners last December and are very pleased with their contribution to our results. Advance Partners contributed approximately 1.5% to the growth in the service revenue for the first quarter. Client retention has remained strong, providing excellent customer service as our top priority. We have continued to invest in our operations and compliant services to support growth and ensure we maintain best-in-class client service. One area of focus has been the expansion of our multiproduct service center, which primarily assists our midmarket clients who attach additional services with payroll. We've also invested in our insurance operations team to increase support for our Affordable Care Act service clients as we approach the 2016 calendar year filing. We recently announced the expansion of the AICPA-Paychex partner program to include human resource services in addition to payroll and retirement benefits. This program allows CPAs who refer to us to broaden their advisory role with clients by offering them a suite of best-in-class services and provides a strong referral channel for us. We are proud to be the preferred provider of payroll retirement and now human resource outsourcing services for the AICPA, CPA.com, and its CPA members. The Department of Labor's final overtime rule will become effective December 1, which will expand overtime for millions of workers. This new legislation makes accurate time and attendance tracking more important than ever, and we have found that many businesses remain unaware of the legislation and the impact on their business. We recently announced enhancements to our time and attendance service portfolio with the addition of Paychex Flex Time Essentials, TrueShift Time clock and an advanced scheduling feature within our Paychex Flex Time module. The investment in this technology demonstrates our continued commitment to providing industry-leading solutions that educate and assist our clients to comply with the new regulations and stay more connected to their employees and their businesses. These new products enhance our commitment to supporting our clients for the entire employee journey from the posting of a position, interviewing a job offer, onboarding the new employee, and handling all the daily tasks and life events with a simple integrated SaaS software-as-a-solution platform combined with personalized and flexible service options. We are very proud of the support our employees provide small and midsize businesses with this broad and advanced product set in commitment to great service, particularly as we enter our 45th year in business. Along with that, I\u2019m very proud of some recent recognition our Paychex team has received. Our insurance agency ranked number 23 on Business Insurance Magazine's 2016 list of top 100 brokers of U.S. business. This is our sixth appearance on the list, and we once again rank as one of the fastest-growing insurance agencies in the nation. We've been named to Selling Power Magazine's 2016 list of 50 best companies to sell for landing at number seven. This is the fourth consecutive year Paychex has appeared on the list moving up from the number nine spot last year, very proud to be in the top 10 of best companies to sell for. And Paychex was once again ranked as the largest 401(k) record keeper by total number of defined contribution plans according to the recent survey by PLANSPONSOR Magazine, a national publication dedicated to the pension and retirement industry. We also continue with our shareholder friendly actions in the first quarter. In July, we increased our quarterly dividend by 10% or $0.04 per share to $0.46 per share. Our Board of Directors also approved an additional authorization to repurchase up to $350 million of our outstanding common stock which expires now and May 2019. We did not repurchase any shares in the first quarter but we'll continue to assess the opportunity to buy back shares during the year to offset dilution. In summary, we are off to a great solid start. We're receiving very good recognition and I'm very appreciative of the great work of our Paychex employee team, sales ops, and all the support teams in the company. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera and Efrain will review our financial results in more detail. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks Marty, and good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve some risks. Please refer to our earnings release which includes a discussion of forward-looking statements and related risk factors. As discussed first quarter financial results for fiscal 2017 represent a solid start to the year. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter. I'll provide greater detail in certain areas and end with a review of our 2017 outlook. Total service revenue grew 9% for the first quarter to $774 million. Interest on funds held for clients increased 11% for the first quarter to $12 million as a result of higher average interest rates earned. Expenses increased 8% for the first quarter, and Advance Partners contributed approximately 1% of this growth. Compensation-related expenses increased 6% primarily due to higher wages resulting from growth in headcount in both operations and sales. Our effective income tax rate was 33% for the first quarter compared to 29.7% to the prior year's first quarter. The effective income tax rates have been impacted by discrete tax items recognized in both of these periods, so last quarter - last year's first quarter and this year's first quarter. In the first quarter of this fiscal year, we recorded a tax benefit resulting from the adoption of new accounting guidance partially offset by the recognition of an additional provision related to a state tax matter. These items increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.025 per share to be precise. If you remember, last year in the first quarter we\u2019ve recognized a net tax benefit on income from prior tax years related to customer-facing software we produced. This resulted in an increase in diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.06 per share for that period, so now if I could just do an editorial. You'll see that when we talk about net income, we carefully say as reported net income. So we're going to give you guidance on as reported net income and net income excluding discrete items. The punch-line of that - the punch-line of that is that there's been no change. We just need you to look at those two items, down to discrete items, and we will talk about that in a second, and see that essentially it doesn't change the guidance. I have seen some notes that seem to think it does - it doesn't, I\u2019ll come to that in a second. I just mentioned adoption of new accounting guidance impacting the effective tax rate. We early adopted new accounting guidance related to employee share-based payment. As a result, we recognized a net tax benefit in the income statement. This was previously required to be recorded as additional paid-in capital in equity. On an as reported basis, net income increased 4% to $217 million and diluted EPS increased 3% to $0.60 per share in the first quarter. Growth rates for net income and diluted earnings per share were impacted by approximately 5% and 6% as a result of the recognition of the discrete items in the respective periods, so I give you those numbers, so you can reconcile back to what it would look like if you excluded those items. Let's talk about payroll service revenue, it increased 4% for the first quarter to $451 million. We benefited from increases in client base and revenue per check. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting. In addition, Advance Partners, which we acquired last year contributed approximately 1% to the growth in payroll service revenue for the first quarter. Checks per payroll were not a contributing factor in the reported payroll revenue growth, and we expect to continue to see that to be the case. Our HRS revenue increased strongly to 15% in the first quarter $323 million. Increase reflected strong growth in client base across all major HCM Services including our comprehensive outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance, and HR administration and I take this point or pause to say that remember that part of what we report in HRS are the modules that we sell on the HCM system. So in order to understand clearly what we're doing, you need to look at both categories. Within Paychex HR Services, we continue to see strong demand which is reflected in the double-digit year-over-year growth in the number of client worksite employees served. Insurance services benefited from continued growth in revenue from our full-service Affordable Care Act product and growth in the number of health and benefit applicants. Our workers comp insurance product benefited from higher average premiums and client base growth. Retirement services revenue benefited from increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value purchase and funds, as well as an increase in plans served. Last, Advance Partners contributed approximately 2% to the growth in HRS revenue for the first quarter. Investments and income. Our goal is to predict principal and optimize liquidity as you all know on the short term side primary short-term investment vehicles or bank demand deposit accounts and variable-rate demands. In our longer term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities. Our long term portfolio has an average yield of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.3 years. Combined portfolios earned an average of 1.2% for the first quarter which is up from 1% last year. I'll just say one note on that, the Fed - it's very difficult to figure out what exactly is going on. Our guidance at this point does not include or anticipate any increases in the interest rate as I look at consensus model, looked like some of you are modeling an increase in their - at this point it's not in our guidance. Average bounces for interest on funds held for clients decreased by approximately 1% during the first quarter primarily as a result of lower state unemployment rates partially offset by growth in client base. I'll now walk you through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $944 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients as of August 31 were $3.4 billion compared to $4 billion as of May 2016, but as you know funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and they averaged $3.8 billion for the quarter. Our total available-for-sale investments including corporate investments in funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $63 million as of the end of the quarter and this compares with net unrealized gains of $48 million as of the end of May 31. Total stockholders' equity was $2 billion as of August 31, 2016 reflecting $166 million in dividends paid during the first quarter, a return on equity for the past 12 months was a sterling 39%. Our cash flows from operations were $295 million for first quarter, an increase of 6% over the prior year period. This change was primarily a result of higher net income, a slight increase in non-cash adjustments and fluctuations in working capital. Now guidance for the remainder of the year. So with the close of the first quarter, when you take the opportunity to fine-tune the guidance we provided last quarter, we remind you that our outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continue with no significant changes against to the full year fiscal of 2017 is as follows; payroll service revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 3% to 4%, and if you recall this is a change we had set 4% and from our perspective it's fine-tuning. Let me give you some detail on the quarter so you know how we expect to get to that. On a quarterly basis if you look at the second and the fourth quarter - second and fourth quarter we expected to be in this range. In the third quarter which is where we lose one day this year, we expect to be between 2% and 3%. So let me just reiterate that. Second and fourth quarters comparable on a daily basis to last year we expect to be in that range of 3 or 4. In the third quarter expect to be between 2 and 3 we have one less day in the third quarter. HRS revenue growth is anticipated to remain the same which is 12% to 14%. Total service revenue continues to be in the range of 7% to 8% also. Consistent with prior guidance, income excluding float as a percentage of total service revenue is expected to be approximately 38%. As you know, first quarter has typically had a higher margin and we expect that operating income excluding float in the second quarter won't be as high, we expect it to be between 38% and 39%. Now, as reported net income growth is anticipated to be approximately 7%. Some people took that and assumed that there was a change in guidance, simply reflecting the fact that we now have discrete items in first quarter and discrete items in the prior year first quarter. We wanted to give you a number that you could anchor your model on to understand what it looks like before you subtract them. So as reported - I repeat that again, net income growth is anticipated to be approximately 7%. This reflects the impact of the discrete tax items I just mentioned which were recognized in both this quarter and prior year first quarter. And it should be obvious that our previous guidance with adjusted for the discrete item in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. Obviously, we did not know at the time, we\u2019re going to record a discrete item in the first quarter what we would have thought. When you make the adjustments and we exclude non-recurring items, net income will be the same as our prior guidance. So there is no change to the guidance, it simply gives you another data point on which to anchor the market. Our effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 35% which also reflects the impact of the discrete tax items. So, you can see our tax right in the first quarter was lower, subsequent quarters will be a higher to get us to approximately 35% for the year. Other aspects of our guidance have remained unchanged from what we previously provided. I hope that clarifies the guidance and I will turn it now back to Martin. Martin Mucci : Great, and operator, we'll now open up for any questions please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We have a question from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open. Rayna Kumar : Good morning, this is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. Thanks for the clarification on the net income guidance. That was very helpful. Just one more on the guidance. I know you said you fine-tuned your payroll service revenue from 4% growth to now 3% to 4%. I guess what are you seeing that may be different in the market that made you bring the guidance a notch down? Efrain Rivera : Well we said the guidance was approximately 4% when we released in or when we discussed it in the fourth quarter, and it just simply reflects fine-tuning as we look through the remainder of the quarters in the year. So, we don\u2019t think it represents a significant change from where we were, and it puts us pretty comparable to the growth rate we had last year. Rayna Kumar : Got it. So your largest competitor is seeing some client losses in the mid market. Are you, is Paychex benefiting from this? Martin Mucci : I think - this is Marty. I think to some degree, yes, I mean I don\u2019t think we felt like the competitive environment has changed all that much. I do think that we're very proud of the product that we have now, very full suite of HCM's total solution including the latest time and attendance additions. And so I think we\u2019re competing very well with them. I think - I don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed. We haven't seen a change dramatically but we\u2019ve certainly continue to feel very positive about where we are. Rayna Kumar : It's very helpful. And lastly, could you just quantify on that price increases you're seeing in both payroll and HR services? Thank you. Efrain Rivera : So payroll is different from HR services, but both are in the same in the same range -- in the range of 2% to 4%. On HRS, we don't uniformly apply price increases across all products. We really do that based on where we see the market. So - but our price increases are in the 2% to 4% range. Rayna Kumar : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks guys. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a follow-up on the core payroll outlook. And I understand that in terms of order of magnitude, it is fine-tuning from about 3% to 4%. But historically it's somewhat unusual for Paychex to tweak its outlook really at all so early in the fiscal year. So just curious what led to the decision to kind of formally make that change, even though it's not a big one given that you've got eight months left in the fiscal year? Was there anything kind of company specific or I think you said you are not really assuming any changes in the macro backdrop. So just on the margin where -- was there a little bit of an adjustment from your perspective? Martin Mucci : Yes, I guess, Jason, what I - I\u2019ll be answering that, this way. So when we look at the year, there are lots of things that can affect what we expect the growth rate to be not the least of which is what's the composition of the days in a year. And so, where we begin and where we end has an impact as we go through the year and we look at what the run rate is on a particular day. That's one thing that influences it. But second thing is, what is the actual impact of one less day in a given quarter? So in the third quarter, we have one less day. We quantify that impact as we go through the year and understand what we think it will be, and that basically was what was impacting our decision to fine-tune a bit. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. I mean, as you look beyond this year, I mean is three to four kind of a new normal \u2013 I mean you've got the U.S. economy that\u2019s basically running in the range of full employment, you\u2019ve still got a little bit of help from Advance on a full-year basis this year. So I just want to make sure our expectations are properly calibrated, eventually unemployment, probably tick-up. So is three to four a decent range or do you think you can really be mid-single digits in core payroll kind of over the medium to longer-term? Martin Mucci : So two things I would say, Jason. One is, it\u2019s early I think we need to go through the year and see. Jason Kupferberg : Yes. Martin Mucci : I would say that we do not get the contribution from checks for payroll that we were getting two or three years ago and don't expect that that will recur. So you got to work a little bit harder. And then the third thing I would say is that, I want to be careful to say that the payroll service revenue is core payroll, it is not. Payroll service revenue is core payroll plus the portions of the HCM bundle that are payroll. That number can vary and it will depend on what - how much of those packages we sell in the mid-market and what the pricing the payroll in the mid-market is. You have to look at both components of revenue in order to understand what the trends are. So subject to all of that we'll update as we go through, we\u2019ll update when we get to the end of the year. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Just one more from me. I think you haven\u2019t bought back any shares and I think three of the past four quarters, but you did the new authorization over the summer. So is the lack of buyback just because the current price is not viewed as attractive enough or is the M&A pipeline becoming more robust or any other factors that you might highlight? And thanks for taking the questions. Martin Mucci : Yes, I appreciate it. I think it has something to do with the timing of authorization and the other factors. You mentioned we're excluding the price of the shares that\u2019s really not part of what goes into our thinking. Jason Kupferberg : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Danyal Hussain : Hi, good morning, Martin and Efrain and thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about the relative performance of payroll versus HRS and I know Efrain there's one thing you called before at the revenue allocation process that maybe, if you could talk a little bit about more about it and specifically is that client are being given an explicitly higher discount on payroll upfront then exchange for adding more module or did they only see a single bundle price, just little more color there, will be helpful? Thanks. Efrain Rivera : Well I think Danyal to your point, there is no general answer I can give on that. But certainly depending on the deal you discount at, what you think make sense and is logical. So, it could very well be that a bundle that has more modules and it is discounted more than a bundle that has fewer models in it. So that's part of the equation. But there is other elements that add into it which is, what\u2019s the composition and the size of the clients you are selling in a given quarter. So that can be variable, so as we go through the year we'll see where we end up. Martin Mucci : And I think the focus more and more they do see a bundle price, so I think more and more we tend to look at the total service revenue, the allocation between them, because we are selling more and more bundles and the bundles are getting larger and more complex. I think we tend to more and more look at the total service revenue growth and where that growth is and how we target that. So it gets a little bit harder here as Efrain said that keep - kind of splitting this up and allocating it out and getting really fine-tuned on everything Danyal Hussain : Got it. And then just the question on the upcoming December 1 deadline, could you just remind us what the current penetration is of the timing and product. And then you mentioned some of these newer I guess versions, so is there any revenue uplift associated with those? Martin Mucci : We certainly expect it to be. What we are doing is we fine tune the full product the Flex Time with more - with better more I guess I'd say more advance scheduling modules, so there is lot more flexibility to scheduling and how you do it. We've added a clock on the low end that gives you, it's a wireless clock and that's the shift time and it makes it easier to have a clock and maybe some difficult locations and has a couple of other features with it as well. And then the Essentials is probably the biggest thing we've introduced. It's a basically a scale down version of our web- based Paychex Flex Time offering. So to make it easier for clients to get started and to have a product that doesn't have quite as many bells and whistles on it but that they need it. So we do think there is going to be some uplift. We've seen double-digit increases in the sales. I'd say the penetration is still pretty low. So it's definitely, I'd say where we are now, you know 10% or somewhere in there little bit more, but it will lot of room to grow and our biggest opportunity I think right now is we still see 50% slightly or 50% of our clients based on our surveys or in businesses in general, small businesses that are impacted, you are not even aware of the overtime regulations. So we think there is going to be some good sales not only this quarter, next quarter, but I think it's going to continue as the compliance requirements and maybe some push back on enforcement makes businesses realize they really got a - they got to get involved and make sure that they are recording and scheduling time appropriately. Danyal Hussain : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. James Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe comment one last time on the kind of the pricing environment and I think Marty you referenced the fact that in the mid market you're seeing little bit more mid market pricing pressure. Can you maybe say whether that is at all a contributor to the downtick in the core payroll guidance, or whether it's just another factor of the bundle pricing that you referenced earlier? Martin Mucci : Yes, I don\u2019t - on the mid market if I did - you might be misread, I didn\u2019t really feel - I don\u2019t see too much different pricing pressure there. I feel the competitive environment is pretty much the same as that has been same number of competitors and I think if anything we are feeling stronger about where we are from a mid market product than we certainly did a year or two years ago with the complete bundle product that we offer and the addition that we're constantly making almost quarterly to the HCM bundle we have for Flex. So, we are feeling good about it. The pricing is as Efrain said still in that 2% to 4% kind of increased range. I think we are holding price pretty well particularly in that mid market and we are gaining more revenue per client based on the bundle. So we feel pretty good about it right now. I think the only thing that we see impacting that would be more of the economy in general and we don\u2019t really see any major changes there other than that businesses are getting closer to full employment and we are seeing the checks per client slow, but we expect that frankly for the last couple of years as people came back from recession. So we feel good about the mid market and we are fully staffed, in fact we've increased more reps there than any other division in the mid market because of the product investments we've made and the opportunity we have between service and product. So you're pretty good about the mid market right now and the opportunity particularly for selling season. James Schneider : Understand, thanks. And then maybe - can you maybe comment on the bookings environment you've seen over the past few months separately on the HRS versus the PEO side and whether those have been running kind of ahead of plan given the fact that you've been putting up little bit stronger HRS revenue growth in the current quarter than you guided too. Martin Mucci : I think the human resource outsourcing in total, we're reaching nearly a million client employees now and between our product sets and I think that need continues to grow. So, we're feeling good about overall HR outsourcing solutions that we're providing. So I think that\u2019s going to continue. The need as these rules keep getting more complex, whether it\u2019s time and attendance or minimum wage or ACA even for this year for many clients now starting to even pay attention that didn't last year as the rules and deadlines are really sticking this year as opposed to being delayed last year. I think that needs are going to continue to increase and will do well in that in that category. James Schneider : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Rick Eskelsen : Hi, how are you? Thank you for taking my question. The first one is just a quick follow-up on the question related to the timing of attendance products. Can you just confirm that, that\u2019s in HRS piece of the - how you reported. So if there is an uptick, it would be in HRS. Martin Mucci : Yes, I'd confirm two things, one is, yes it is and second, we did see an uptick. Rick Eskelsen : Specifically from the time and attendance? Martin Mucci : Yes, we did. Rick Eskelsen : Okay. Then the next question is just more of a sort of a philosophical one about service versus technology, would you guys having built out your technology platform and just got the full functionality here and you\u2019re turning up the dial on some service investments, maybe if you could just talk a little bit about how you view service relative to technology and the competitive differentiation there. I know in the past you\u2019ve talked about how you think your services, a big strong differentiator. So just what, how do you view that now and what do you think the investments you\u2019re making are going to do to continue to deepen that. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Yes I think so - we\u2019ve always been very much known as a service company and our technology was really more internal that next external for the client facing in beginning about six years ago, we really ramped up the investment and technology. And I think the technology becomes part of the service story, clients want to do more themselves, they want to do it online, mobile, they want to do and how they want to do it when and where they want.  And I think that the investments have been very balanced in both technology and service from a service perspective, the big investments, particularly the last few years have been driving now multi-product centers, so pulling our folks together to service multiple products in those bundles together driving a little bit more self service, so clients can do more things and their employees can on the web around mobile apps. I think it\u2019s always going to be about service, it\u2019s how you define service and the service definition has become a lot more about technology and how easy it is for clients to use it, if they want to use it and when and how they want to use it. So we feel very good about the balance of investments that we\u2019ve made in technology and service and continue to make. Rick Eskelsen : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Marty, I wanted to ask you about, you talked about ACA and that being a benefit, I'm wondering as you look at the HRS business, how much of a benefit do you think that is and can it continue into next year or do you start comping against that next year? Martin Mucci : Well, I think you do to some degree. Obviously, even last year the big sales opportunity was that initial push for the majority of our existing clients to say, hi, you need this and we sell it to them. We've done well there with retention in the sales last year now you\u2019re selling more to those clients that in our client base either weren't. We\u2019re not aware of it, it didn\u2019t apply to them or they just didn\u2019t bother to buy it and they're trying to get through it on their own and then new clients coming on of course that now needed we\u2019re changing. So I think you\u2019ll see that has some impact this year because there\u2019s not as, obviously as much opportunity as last year. But, but what then on the other hand, we see time and attendance in the overtime regulations as the new opportunity not quite as big as the ACA opportunity, but I think, yes the comps will get tougher on that only but more to last year because you had that initial, I can sell a lot of clients that my existing client base that doesn't have it. Kartik Mehta : And Efrain I know I apologize, I know I\u2019m parsing words here but I just want to make sure if you talk about checks per client not helping, was it a detractor or was it just neutral? Efrain Rivera : It actually had a slight, a slight negative effect largely due to mix, but we\u2019ve been that\u2019s been part of the equation over the last three or four quarters - certainly last three quarters. Kartik Mehta : And then just one last question, Marty. Advance Partner seems like that acquisition is going well, I just wanted to get your thoughts on your ability to maybe consolidate that industry more and make it a bigger part of Paychex. Is that a possibility now that you own it and just your perspective on the industry and the Paychex's ability to grow in that? Martin Mucci : Yes, Kartik I think it is. I think there is an opportunity there that if we've seen the leadership team there and their results have been very positive and better than we've expected and as we've gotten to know that industry little bit more from the leadership team there and now getting to know the business even better, we do think there is an opportunity for more roll up there with various smaller firms, there is a tremendous amount of companies that do this on a small basis and our niche kind of oriented and I think it really benefit from a consolidation strategy there. So we're certainly looking at that and trying to be very opportunistic and see if the evaluations are correct and I do think we have the capacity to do that and the leadership team there has capacity to do that. Kartik Mehta : Thanks, Marty. I appreciate it. Operator : We have a question from Tim McHugh from William Blair. Your line is open. Stephen Sheldon : Good morning. It's Stephen Sheldon in for Tim. First, now that Paychex Flex is out in the market and most products are on the platform. I guess where you're guiding kind of incremental investments spending at this point? Martin Mucci : Well it continues to be into that product like when you think about I think now we are getting more probably fine tuning - when you think about time and attendance for example, we saw that the existing module is very good for mid market and more complex clients, but we had a real opportunity one of the difficulties with time and attendance is somewhat complex to get started and that tend to turns clients off sometimes. And so we scale down and rolled out the Flex Time Essentials now just this quarter. And so I think you'll see continued investments like that. The other thing is analytics. We are getting more into data analytics and using our reporting packages to guide - to make them more flexible and easier to gain data out of the reporting packages to offer data analytics to our clients frankly of all sizes, and you'll see continued investment in analytics and reporting. And I'd say as well, continued kind of adding more kind of bells and whistles. At the same time we're building out a simpler interface to HTML5 for all of our products and mobile first design. So everything is being designed now mobile first and so that it can be used very effectively on our mobile approximately, as well as then expand to whatever device you are using. So more products finding niches where the product like Flex Time Essentials can be used and the design itself making it easier to use. Stephen Sheldon : Okay. That's helpful. And then I think you touched on it little bit before, but just wanted to ask about usage of cash on this point and maybe an update on the M&A environment and the pipeline you are seeing? Thanks. Efrain Rivera : I think earlier I answered the question on Jason might have asked about share repurchase. So we'll do share repurchases to combat some dilution that we are seeing. So that will be part of it this year and then the M&A pipeline is pretty robust. So there are number of opportunities that we see could use part of that cash or all of it. So we are - we continue to evaluate those frequently get down the road down and then for whatever reason it doesn\u2019t look up to pretty choosy, but we think there is opportunities out there and that's why in part that cash is there. Stephen Sheldon : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from David Grossman of Stifel. Sir, your line is open. David Grossman : Hi Efrain, Marty, good morning. Just quick follow-up to one of the question I think Marty you'd mentioned in response to the Affordable Care Act, you said you were pretty much comping against that strength already this year, I just wanted to make sure that I heard that right? Martin Mucci : I think well what we are having against is yes that big first burst last year that we had been able to sell a lot to the existing client base, that didn\u2019t have it. Basically went from no one having it to a large number of our clients having it. Now you are selling to those clients that now needed because their situation changed, they're new clients, or they just didn\u2019t bother with it last year because they thought it didn\u2019t apply to them. So, it does put a little bit of a push on us that we've got to surpass the initial growth rate last year. David Grossman : So stated differently, I think the spirit of the other question was that going into fiscal 2018 you wouldn\u2019t really expect much of a headwinds from whatever thrust you got or incremental sales you got from the Affordable Care Act last year? Martin Mucci : No, not in 2018, actually more of the pressure is this year because we are selling\u2026.. David Grossman : Right, okay. And then the second question I had is, this week one of the ERP vendor mentioned that they were moving down market and I think the way they characterized this was about 250 employees. And I know that probably above your sweet spot, but I'm just curious what your views are on that segment given that it seems to be getting increasingly crowded and then if you could tie that into your comment about the use of -- the increasing focus on technology and more interaction if you will with the end user? Martin Mucci : Yes, I heard we\u2019ve -- I'm not sure exactly who that, because I guess I haven\u2019t seen that, but there is a number of over the years that there\u2019s been a number of large players who have said, hey, I am going to come down into that below 500 market and capture that. And the issue is, usually they are very heavy in technology and complicated technology and have a hard time bringing it down to a business that has an HR Department of one to five to 10 people, and making it simple for them to use, affordable for them to use, and then being able to service them and keep the margins that they're used to. They also tend to be much higher in software development, typically and technology only then knowing how to service those kind of clients. I think we've had obviously a track record of moving up and our -- we do feel like in the mid-market our sweet spot is certainly, anywhere from 20 to 500 in that mid-market space. We used to think it was 50 plus, but it really has come down some with the need to the business. So it doesn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t -- we haven\u2019t seen much change in the competitive environment and while I'm always concerned about changing competition, we don\u2019t see anybody right now knew that\u2019s coming down, that necessarily could be that successful. But, hey, that\u2019s why we got to keep our products and service great, so that we can certainly compete with anybody. David Grossman : Right. Can give us a sense for just kind of important the technology is versus the service, as you migrate between these different break points in terms of employees? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think the technology gets more important as a component of service when you get a 100 plus, 200 plus, because there are also we are seeing clients move more toward pushing employees to be more self service. But that\u2019s exactly where number of our investments have been going as being sure that whether it\u2019s on a mobile app for the employee of the client, or for the client itself that they can do things, they can make changes, they can view, so they are taking heat off the HR departments of these companies. And I think so when you get a 100 plus, 200 plus, the technology is important, but you better have the service to back it up, because, well it sounds great when those employees got to do something self service, you want to have some place for them to fall back on to call and that\u2019s where I think we are very good at balancing both the technology investment and our service. Particularly now when we have added web chats, 7/24 service, multi-product centers all those are appealing to that group that\u2019s looking for technology, but once it fall back to personalized committed service. David Grossman : I got it. Thanks. That\u2019s actually very helpful. And just one last question. Efrain, for the headwind when do we actually anniversary that on the balance? Efrain Rivera : That\u2019s a good question. I think we're going to -- we'll battle it most throughout the year. So I think probably somewhere in third and fourth quarter, my guess is probably more fourth quarter. David Grossman : All right. And then it does not then it flattens out for fiscal 2018? Efrain Rivera : David, yes, I would expect that and then every year we go through another round of seeing what\u2019s happening with unemployment rate. So we could have variability. David Grossman : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Ridley-Lane, dialed in for Sara Gubins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. David Ridley-Lane: I wanted to ask about the pace of service headcount additions to support the midmarket and maybe Affordable Care Act offerings. Are you currently at the plan staffing levels, are you planning to continue to increase through the year. Martin Mucci : Yes David, at this point we\u2019re at the planned levels, we're stepped up in all areas. And we\u2019ve got full complement of what we need we feel unless the sales pick up more than we thought, but we feel very good about where we are. We've also made some technology changes to make it easier for a client to give us the information and for us to file because there won\u2019t be - we don\u2019t expect any delay in the filing requirements this year. So we\u2019re fully staffed in and ready to handle it. David Ridley-Lane: Got it. And then on the adoption of same day ACH payments, would that have a potential negative impact on your client float balances over time. Efrain Rivera : I\u2019ve been asked a couple times so same day ACH if it reached widespread adoption could impact short term cash balance, probably not long-term. It also has a benefit in that you may be able to get additional fees for running very late payroll. So it's too early to tell. I would say, it\u2019s a very modest negative but that would depend on it being adopted in a widespread way. Martin Mucci : Yes, we've really seen is - it\u2019s a benefit to our clients that have a last-minute change or something as Efrain said, there might be some revenue opportunity there. There is also a great service opportunity where someone a client makes an error needs a last-minute change, we\u2019re now able to work that through the banking system with the ACH and so we\u2019re not expecting it to be kind of like a basic payroll, where that's the norm, it\u2019s more an additional service really that we can provide. David Ridley-Lane: Got it. And then just a quick numbers question. Does the new $350 million buyback replace deal authorization? Martin Mucci : Yes, yes. Basically we cancelled that out in start with 350. David Ridley-Lane: Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gary Bisbee : Hi guys, good morning. First question, does the new share-based payment accounting treatment, assuredly thinking that as a discrete impact on the quarter, or is that going to be an ongoing impact of putting this and if so do you have a sense what you\u2019re expecting in the remainder of the fiscal year and moving forward. Efrain Rivera : Yes, so good question. So it is discrete and it will remain discrete when we, when we recorded in a given quarter. It could have modest impacts in subsequent quarters, we\u2019ll call it out, we don\u2019t expect that will have the level of impact that it had - that it had this quarter. So I\u2019ll just leave it at that. Gary Bisbee : And was there sort of a catch-up impact or was this just - that there was for some reason bigger tax benefit than normal from options this quarter and now that close the P&L versus historically didn't? Efrain Rivera : Yes, there wasn\u2019t a catch up - without getting into the weeds on the mechanics of the computation which are complex, sufficed to say that the combination of an increase in share price coupled with an increase in share exercises ended up creating a situation where we had more benefit in the quarter. And this will happen periodically throughout in the future. And we\u2019ll just call it out when it happens. We don\u2019t anticipate that it will be as sharp as it was this quarter. Gary Bisbee : Okay, great, thanks. And then there's always a lot of questions about the payroll growth versus HR and I guess it seems to me that you alluded a couple of times that may be the distinction isn\u2019t as strong as it was in the past. But from that perspective, can you just help us understand how much of your selling efforts headcount time in the field, however you want to talk about it, its focused on upselling more components, the broader product set into a pretty sticky in large phase versus people who are out there prospecting for new payroll customers. Has that changed is it more of the focus selling more stuff in the base today than it was in the past? Martin Mucci : I don\u2019t think is changed. Well, obviously there is lot more opportunity, but I would say you know probably if you thought about core payroll and that sales team and then the way MMS the mid market team goes after, probably 40%, 50% is still on acquiring new clients and going after them and getting them on board and then the other 50% is really there - when you think about all of HRS really they're selling into the base for the most part. And then a number of the core and MMS payroll teams are back selling more clients - more products, but I'd say it's probably around 50-50 and I don\u2019t know if it's changed all that much. I think they are focused though on selling the full package upfront is different. So it's a little bit different than the way I was probably you're thinking about it. We sale a lot more full package right upfront, our old style would be so payroll you get used to us, you get happy with us. Six months later I come back and see if 401(k) is value to you or workers comp or health insurance. Now what we are finding is clients want the full value upfront. They want - they have a full need in mind and it's not just they want payroll for now and then I'll come talk to me. So we are selling more and what we call integrated sales approach where multiple teams will go and see a brand new client and sale them could be everything including HR outsourcing because that's what they really were looking for and payroll was just coming along with it. So but I think if you say 50-50 roughly that would be fine, it just a focus is very different now for the sales team every from core right through. Gary Bisbee : And then can you just give us an update on penetration of some of the key categories and what's getting factor to further penetrate and whether it's 401(k) or full outsource than some of the other major product categories, is it price, is it you are getting out and telling the story what can you do to drive that penetration are? Martin Mucci : Well that's something obviously we are always looking at. I think the penetration rates are still pretty low, so lot's of opportunity there for us. I think it's a combination of all of those. It's a combination what is the client see the value and for like 401(k) for example and or do they feel the pressure from their employee base. We are feeling more clients come to us for products like insurance and 401(k) because there is - it's harder with full employment are moving towards full employment, it's harder for them to capture new employees unless they have the benefit packages that they might not have needed two years ago in order to compete for their employees. So it's the need in the market. It's a value to the client and it's execution. Obviously, we spend a tremendous amount of time training, making sure the products are available, making sure that we have the training and all the sales force tools. We've added tremendous amount of tools to the sales force, data analytics what clients we have that are most likely to buy 401(k), most likely to buy insurance, sales force all of that tools all helped execution. So it's a number of things, I'd say penetration rate still give us tremendous amount of opportunity. We are moving them up, but there is still lot of room to grow and I think we are putting everything in place to be successful about it. Gary Bisbee : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Tian Jing Wang from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tian Jing Wang : Good morning. I was going to talk to you guys. The slides - just looking at the slides it looks like on the cash the long term capital strategy page you are talking strategic accretive acquisitions. I'm curious accretive is that sort of one year sort of ambition or is it - are you telling us where we shouldn\u2019t expect any dilutive deals from there. Efrain Rivera : I would say that's a long term issue and when I mentioned this, look if the technology is right we think there is a strategic advantage in buying a company for example SurePayroll that would not accretive we'll do it. So every deal is not going to be accretive right out of the gate, some aren\u2019t. So we are pretty tough on the criteria of dilution in the first year, but if it makes sense we look at it. Tian Jing Wang : Understood. That's good to know. And then just on the overtime legislation, you said there was a little bit uptick in this quarter, but is there a time frame which we might expect a more significant uptick and tax rate on time and attendants? Martin Mucci : Well, I think we actually have pretty good uptick double-digit growth in this quarter and I think it will -- my expectation would be -- it will be into the next couple of quarters that we\u2019ll continue to see sales do very well with time and attendance. As we are getting closure to that December 1 time frame, this month, next couple of months should see probably the biggest benefit. But I think after that I think clients are really just kind of making themselves aware. But the other thing is -- there is a lot of discussion in the news about, will it be over turned, could it be push back through some court proceeding, but we don\u2019t see that happening at this point, but that could be making clients say, I'm going to wait and see how it happens. So it should be a good year overall, certainly for time and attendance, but I think that this next quarter, this quarter and next quarter probably the best. Tian Jing Wang : Got it. So going into and coming out of it we could see little bit of lift, that\u2019s good to know. Then just lastly just I know there is a lot of questions around payroll and HRS, but just broadly speaking for the quarter how did each of those lines come in versus your internal plan? Efrain Rivera : They were within the range of expectation. So -- I think that\u2019s part of what we look at every quarter is and try to understand what we think trends are and adjust based on what we are seeing. You can see we didn\u2019t change our guidance on income, fine tuned revenue actually HRS services had a strong quarter. We\u2019ll see where we end up year, but overall we think we are in the range of what we expected. Martin Mucci : And we feel good about how we are positioned; we've got fully staffed. From a sales rep standpoint, we grew pretty much all the divisions, but -- in particularly the payroll divisions and that\u2019s getting kind of these new reps -- the newer reps to get up to the production that we like to see. But we're fully staffed in that group. We're are fully staffed in the service teams to handle ACA, which was you know struggle last year just there was just so much change going on there and so we feel good that we are kind of on target for what we expected. Tian Jing Wang : Great. Appreciate the update. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the HRS services could you just talk about like what are the two most penetrated solutions that you are currently offering and what sort of penetration rate that has in order to give a perspective in terms of the opportunity for further cross sell? Martin Mucci : I think the two most penetrated would probably workers comp and the insurance and 401(k), and but the biggest opportunities are still 401(k) certainly and I think we\u2019ve talked about it. We expanded the last -- roughly now two years until what we call large market 401(k). So where we focus a lot on new plans for the first almost 18 years of having the product. The last couple of years we added a whole team which is expanded on conversion plan. So larger asset plans and that group has been doing very well particularly in first quarter we had some nice growth there. So we are building relationships with brokers who refer us now and as these rules get more complex for brokers I think they are bringing our talented kind of tenured team on the large market in the more deals. So that\u2019s very good. So lot of opportunity in 401(k) and lot of opportunity in HR outsourcing would certainly be the next largest meaning ACA -- I am sorry, ASO, PEO and HRE or HR Essentials. So biggest opportunity as big as revenue basis and opportunities that grow I think are 401(k) and HR outsourcing by far. Mark Marcon : Okay. And what\u2019s the penetration rate currently? Martin Mucci : On HR outsourcing you know less than 10% and if you look at client employees, I did say that we're approaching a million worksite employees and we put out about 11 million, 12 million W-2s. So we are little less than 10% on the employees that we are servicing and not all of them will need it based on their size, but we think that their penetration rate is less than 10 and certainly has a lot of upside. Mark Marcon : That\u2019s great color. And then with regards to -- there is clearly a greater emphasis with regards to selling more modules upfront when first sign a client. Can you give us a little bit of perspective in terms of over last couple of years how that\u2019s changed in terms of like typically we used to sell maybe three modules, with the brand new client and now we are up to five, six et cetera like what\u2019s -- what you are seeing on average with new clients, above the smallest clients that you might have just be signing up for this payroll? Martin Mucci : I would say, it\u2019s hard to look at it, because the way we bundle it we don\u2019t think of it as quite as models, but I would say that, probably 25% of the clients to 30% of the clients are taking something maybe 20% to 30% are taking something more right now. This is relatively new approach to the way we\u2019re selling, because we\u2019ve had so many years of selling payroll then coming back.  I think if you're asking how many do we sell a larger bundle upfront. I\u2019d say its closer; it\u2019s more in the 20% to 30% range that we\u2019re selling a bundle versus payroll only and in it has at least one additional service or module with it. I mean we\u2019ve seen the revenue per client has been, we\u2019ve been successful at driving up that revenue per client year after year. So it\u2019s probably the last couple of years. So I hope that helps. Mark Marcon : It does. And then you mentioned checks per client not getting as much help partially due to mix, where are they -- you\u2019re not selling as many like tiny clients anymore are you? Efrain Rivera : We sell small, I mean we absolutely compete very well, its an interesting point Mark. So, there is a trade-off between, if you\u2019re going to go get clients you have to take them away or you have to get them new. And I think we\u2019ve been doing very -- we\u2019ve been very effective particularly in the fourth quarter of last year, we had very good unit growth. So we continue to see unit growth and there is a little bit of a trade-off between unit growth, the unit growth, we\u2019ve been seeing, which has been between 2% and 3% and size of client. So that impacts a little bit. It has a little bit of a drag on growth in the short term not in long-term. Mark Marcon : And tiny, I was talking like the sub six employee? Efrain Rivera : Yes, yes, Mark, absolutely, but a lot of new clients are in that category, absolutely. Martin Mucci : Remember, we're still get great referrals from CPAs and so forth. And so we\u2019re still seeing 50% of the sales are coming from brand-new businesses, and Efrain said a lot of those brand new businesses are sub six. Mark Marcon : Okay, great. And then client retention, I didn\u2019t hear any comments there. Martin Mucci : Yes, still feeling very good about it. We\u2019re right on plan. It\u2019s remained at pretty much close to highest levels of client retention. So right now we feel very good about it. It was a good quarter, continued right through from last year. Mark Marcon : Great. And then lastly on just the strategic acquisitions, you mentioned maybe it was -- maybe I misheard, but I thought I heard you say potentially could use all of the cash. Is that, I mean, that sounds unusual relative to what you\u2019ve done in the past? Efrain Rivera : No, I guess, what I was saying, Mark, is that we have opportunities in the pipeline that could use all of the cash. It doesn\u2019t mean we have an opportunity that\u2019s going to use all of the cash. Mark Marcon : I mean that would not be the expectation. Efrain Rivera : Yes, that would not be the expectation. Mark Marcon : Great. Thanks for clarifying. Congrats. Operator : Next question comes from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is open. Lisa Ellis : Hi, good morning. Thank you for squeezing me. Just wanted to follow up on the comments related to the Accountable Care Act. Now that you\u2019re into the first quarter, I know there\u2019s been a lot of debate about whether this year is going to continue to be strong in Obamacare as companies that didn\u2019t choose to comply last year due this year versus whether they\u2019re sort of a hangover effect or not. So how are you feeling about that now that you\u2019re a few months in? Efrain Rivera : Yes, so we\u2019re -- I think the point was, Lisa, that just that last year, it was kind of that first chance to go after the entire client base, nobody basically have the product. There are a very few, and so we\u2019re able to sell a lot in the particularly in the first few quarters of the year. And now when you anniversary that, we\u2019re still selling the product, but there\u2019s not as much opportunity there.  So I think then the question was what does it look for 2018? 2018 won\u2019t be much of an issue because I think we\u2019ll be very consistent with 2017 to 2018. But 2016 to this year, 2017, there is some impact that we\u2019re not selling as much. On the other hand, we\u2019re selling more of the time and attendance solutions, but their revenue is not quite as much -- the opportunity is not quite as much there.  And it\u2019s not as probably as far-reaching or as demanding or as creating as much angst with clients as the Affordable Care Act was because of the penalty situation. Now the overtime stuff could start to pick up if enforcement picks up as well. But I think that\u2019s just going to take a little bit longer. So again, it\u2019s having some impact versus last year, but it\u2019s not a huge thing, but it\u2019s having some impact. Lisa Ellis : Yes. And are there other regulatory changes or rules on the horizon that you would call out like that you see sort of steady pipeline of these real thing considered either at the federal level or in certain states that would kind of continue to drive the incremental secular demand from the regulatory changes? Martin Mucci : Yes, there hasn\u2019t been - there has been a steady flow based on current administration and probably won't change much in the election which could have some impact, but minimum wage for example right now it's extremely confusing for our clients minimum wage rules are different by state, the Feds talk about changing minimum wage they have for government, but some of those are in that tied into government, but states are different, cities are different and we really help a lot of our clients help - we help them through our payroll service only or our HR outsourcing to stay up with minimum wage changes because not only are they are not changing ones they are changing over period of years and you have to make sure that you stay current with those. And there is a lot of work on identifying like who is a the kind of immigration type things, who is - you got to know your customer, you got to know your employees, you got to make sure you got all that well documented. So the rules keep coming, I don\u2019t think that helps necessarily the business environment in general because of over regulation, but it certainly gives Paychex a lot of opportunities to go and talk to clients about their payroll need and their HR outsourcing need, because small to midsized business is just can't keep it up with all of these changes. The other thing is that enforcement and the penalty have increased as states and federal governments have looked for revenue sources. So not only is there an issue about whether you are compliant, but if you are challenged on your compliance, we can provide a tremendous amount of help. If you get a penalty in payroll, if you get a penalty for a time issue - a time and attendance issue, we're there to support you with expert documentation and background and relationships with federal state and local governments and that's a big plus that we sell to clients, but they don\u2019t realize sometimes until they are hit with an audit or enforcement penalty. Lisa Ellis : Got it. And then just one final follow-up. I think the last couple of quarters you called out the dynamic in the client base that's been interesting, I think overall average employees per client have been slightly trending down due to the strength in SurePayroll and there is new business formation on the low end, but then at the same time your mid market offerings have been performing well. So it's almost like Barbell kind of effect, or you continuing to see that sort of trend in the client base or anything else like you called out? Efrain Rivera : Yes, let me just provide little more color on that. Yes, if you look at average client size is down very, very slightly that has an impact but you are right the difficulty is you can't see that completely in payroll, so if you look at our mid market platform taken as a whole including the module that are typically sold with our HR online and time and attendance, you see nice growth over the last two or three years. Payroll has done fine too, but it has a little bit of that headwind because of slightly lower client size driven by some positive which is increasing client growth. So, we've gone from growing the client base of 1% to growing between 2% and 3%, hopefully that continues to grow. The reason why we are not as concerned about that is that those clients eventually become larger and purchase more services. So we want to keep the funnel reasonably open at the top. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thank you. Good clarification. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Ariel Hughes from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Ariel Hughes : Hi, Good morning. This is Ariel Hughes. Can you provide us with some color around the correlation between rate increases and float income, specifically around the expected lag time between rate and floating from increases? Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Typically you're going to see at least one if not sometime two quarter to reflect full impact of the rate increase and then we quantify in the Q or in the K at least that the impact of 25 basis points translates into about $3.5 million to $4 million on an annual basis. So that's kind of the thought process that we have. Ariel Hughes : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our last question in queue comes from Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Glenn Greene : Thanks for squeezing me in. Two questions clarifications really on earlier discussion. So first is on the ACA dynamic from last year into this year. I guess I\u2019m little confused if you\u2019re talking about sales bookings benefit last year or revenue benefit and yes I\u2019m a little confused as how quickly these things convert. And the order of magnitude what we\u2019re talking about is, was there sort of a revenue benefit last year that you're now lapping and is overemphasizing this. Martin Mucci : No, just that that\u2019s sales. I\u2019m sorry, just to be clear, glad you asked the clarifying question, that from a revenue standpoint it\u2019s sales perspective. So I\u2019m just saying that we had a big sales impact last year \u2013 we've had a good sales impact last year as we sold the client base, but this year so sales have come down some in the ACA product itself. The revenue because the retention of the clients has been fine and so and there hasn't been any price change really associated with that product or anything else. Glenn Greene : So I guess the natural follow-on is the magnitude of the revenue benefit that you\u2019re realizing in fiscal '17 related to that. Efrain Rivera : Yes, so Glenn I was asked this periodically during the year, we got about a point benefit last year on revenue from additional ACA, ACA revenue and obviously we're anniversarying that and it\u2019s incorporated in the guidance and are dealing with that, that's slight drag and particularly in HRS. Glenn Greene : Okay. And then I know Efrain you went through this in great detail and I appreciate, I know you want to have clarity out there, and I hate you go back to the guidance but I can tell there is still something huge and so I\u2019m going to be specific. So what you\u2019re talking about is take the reported fiscal '16 net income or roughly $757 million well at 7% and then just for sake of argument, we can argue with the fully diluted share account but just using this quarter at 364, we\u2019re talking 222 to 223 in EPS and maybe you get some benefit from share repurchase. Efrain Rivera : Yes it depends on what your assumptions are around shares et cetera. But yes, you\u2019re right. Glenn Greene : Okay. Efrain Rivera : And the reason is maybe I'm being too helpful. You\u2019re going to have a set of reported numbers last year. We're going to have a set of reported numbers this year. I can't give you guidance this year that now excludes one thing in one year and another thing in another year. I could have just done it and say, hey, it is as it is. But my concern is someone's not going to pick up a number that they should. The other thing I would just say is that we want to stir as much away from providing guidance that's not on a GAAP basis, so that\u2019s why we try to clarify stuff. Glenn Greene : So one last thing, so the lower tax rate, the 35% that you now sort of alluded to in your guide, is that the good run rate to think about obviously beyond fiscal '17? Efrain Rivera : 35% no, Glenn, because we\u2019ve got a benefit in the first quarter. So that\u2019s why you - if you remember our guide at the beginning of - in the fourth quarter we guided to 35.5% to 36%. That's a better number than the 35%. The 35% benefits from this one-time benefit we got in Q1, which is from the one-time benefit we got the prior year. Glenn Greene : It makes sense. Okay. I got it, thank you very much. Operator : Speakers, we show no questions in queue. Martin Mucci : All right. Thank you, Jim. Well, at this point, we'll close the call. I just want you to know that we appreciate the interest in questions. We feel very good. As we said, we\u2019re staffed up and ready. We\u2019ve increased our sales force. We feel good about the product and the technology and service investments we've made, and I think we\u2019re off to very consistent and good start. At this point, we\u2019ll close the call. And if you\u2019re interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 30 days. Our annual meeting of stockholders will be held on Wednesday, the 12th, October 12 at 10 a.m. in Rochester. And that meeting will be broadcast simultaneously over the Internet as well. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our first quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day. Operator : That concludes today's conference.

At this time, participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point. And now I will turn the meeting over to your host Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin. Martin Mucci : All right. Thank you and thank you for joining us on our discussion of Paychex\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Release. Joining me is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2016. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. You can access our earnings release and Form 10-Q on our Investor Relations webpage. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month. On today\u2019s call, I will update you on the results of our business in the second quarter and Efrain will review our financial results in more detail and discuss our full-year guidance. After that, we\u2019ll open it up for your questions. Our results for the second quarter reflected good progress. We continue to see positive results across our major product lines and service revenue for the second quarter grew by 7% year-over-year. We achieved a new milestone this quarter as we obtained 1 million client worksite employees, served by our Paychex HR Services. Paychex HR Services is our comprehensive outsourcing services product line and that includes our ASO or Administrative Services Organization and our PEO, our Professional Employer Organization as well. Our cloud-based HCM services, in particular, time and attendance continue to show strong growth in the quarter. Tomorrow is the one year anniversary of the acquisition of Advance Partners. Advance has been an excellent addition to the Paychex family. We\u2019re very pleased with the leadership and the team\u2019s contribution to our financial results and the future opportunities for growth we see in that business particularly timely as the staffing business is picking up some expanded growth today. With the success of our of HCM solutions, we have continued to invest in operations personnel as we\u2019ve expanded our multiproduct service centers, including our time and attendance support and our ACA product compliance and service teams. Client retention remains at consistent high levels. We have also invested in our service \u2013 in our sales organization over the last year adding headcount across all sales teams and we are well-positioned going into our third quarter. We will have a better idea of overall sales performance and the impact of the fiscal year next quarter after the end of our peak sales season. We continue to make it a priority to provide robust HCM solutions that may be \u2013 the evolving needs of our client base. At the recent HR Technology Conference and Exposition in October, we showcased enhancements to Paychex Flex that addressed two of the biggest trends in the HR industry; mobile user experience and HR analytics. Attendees at the conference were able to view a demo of Paychex Flex, which included these enhancements. We also announced that we shifted to a mobile-first design of our HCM suite. This approach allows Paychex Flex users to have full functionality of all application components regardless of device or screen size. The growing trend for both HR leaders and employees is the use of a mobile device. Shifting to a mobile-first design demonstrates our commitment to putting the needs of our clients and their employees first, so that they can accomplish their HR test, where they want, when they want, and on whatever device they want. We continue to receive positive recognition of our Flex platform in November. We were honored to be recognized as a leader in the 2016 NelsonHall Payroll Outsourcing NEAT, a component of the firm\u2019s speed-to-source initiative. NEAT stands for NelsonHall\u2019s evaluation and assessment tool and is a vendor evaluation report tool that can be utilized by managers to evaluate outsourcing vendors. This was the first time we had participated in this initiative and we were placed in the leader quadrant for three areas; technology and user experience, analytics and reporting, and HR cloud integration. The client feedback that goes into this ranking makes a center even more important to us and reinforces our commitment to delivering the best and most robust solutions in the market today with our Paychex Flex platform. This has been a transition period in the U.S. with the presidential election and the move to the Trump administration. We have been asked a few times how we anticipate the new administration will impact the economy overall and more specifically the payroll and human capital management outsourcing industry? In this transition time, many business owners could be hesitant to make longer-term decisions. We see this as being more likely to impact the mid to large-sized businesses rather than small businesses. President-elect Trump is indicated that he intends to lower taxes and create less regulation. This would be a positive for small businesses. It would lower the cost and allow them to invest and higher more. Paychex would benefit as our clients expand and add employees and potentially see value in our HCM services. While complex regulations tend to drive companies to an outsourcing solution, we believe any change in regulation is good for Paychex. We remained informed about what is happening in the regulatory environment and are well-positioned to continue to educate our clients and assist them with their compliance needs through our technology and service support. Over the last year, the Affordable Care Act has been a tailwind for payroll outsourcing companies, including ourselves. Any rollback of Obamacare or Affordable Care Act or a reduction in compliance and administration requirements will impact the HCM outsourcing industry. Given our target market of small to medium-sized businesses, a large portion of our client base is not \u2013 has not been impacted by ACA. In November, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction to temporarily block the Department of Labor\u2019s final overtime rule that would have become effect of December 1. This rule would expand overtime for millions of workers. As a result of this injunction, employers did not have to be in compliance with the new rules as of December 1. The ruling is temporary, but creates substantial uncertainty for businesses. The proposed rules created an enhanced awareness for the need for time and attendance solutions, particularly to those integrated within their \u2013 with the clients HCM product suite. This brought an increased demand for our products that we don\u2019t see diminishing with the delay in the rules. We will continue to monitor the status of these regulations and ensure our clients remain informed as to how any changes may affect them. Shifting the discussion from clients to shareholders, we continued with shareholder-friendly actions. During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares for a total of $166 million, and we will continue to maintain an industry leading dividend yield of over 3% with a quarterly dividend up $0.46 per share. In summary, we have made solid progress in growth in our financial performance during the past quarter, and I appreciate the great work of our Paychex\u2019s employees and management team. And I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Good morning. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve risks, refer to the customary disclosures. As Marty indicated, second quarter financial results fiscal 2017 showed continued progress and growth. I\u2019ll cover some of the key highlights for the second quarter and the six months, provide greater detail in certain areas, and warp with a review of the 2017 outlook. Total service revenue grew 7% for the second quarter to $760 million, and 8% for the six months to $1.5 billion. Interest on funds held for clients increased 2% for the second quarter and 6% for the six months to a $11 million and $23 million, respectively. These changes were primarily driven by slightly higher average interest rates earned. The growth was tempered by a slight decrease in the average investment balances by approximately 1% for both periods. This is really a timing issue that we call out in the press release. Expenses increased to 8% for both the second quarter and six months, with Advance Partners contributing approximately 1.5% to this growth for both periods. Expense growth was impacted by higher wages and related expenses due to growth in headcount in our operations area. Selling expenses have shown modest growth, reflecting strong sales performance in the year-ago quarter. Our operating margin was approximately 40.3% for the second quarter and 40.7% year-to-date comparable with the prior-year periods. We continue to maintain industry-leading margins, while investing in our operations. Our effective income tax rate was 35.2% for the second quarter and 34.1% for the six months, compared to 36% and 32.9% for the respective periods last year. As we discussed on our last quarterly call, we had several discrete items \u2013 tax items in the first quarter both years that have impacted the year-to-date effective income tax rates. In fiscal 2017, we implemented new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based compensation, which has resulted in discrete tax benefits now being recognized upon exercise or lapse of stock-based awards. The impact of this in the second quarter was immaterial, but had a larger impact in the first quarter. Last year in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we recognized a net tax benefit on income from prior tax years related to customer-facing software we produced, because there have been ins and outs refer to the press release and you\u2019ll see we provide a non-GAAP EBITDA comparison, I should say, non-GAAP EPS comparison with and without these items. Net income increased 7% to $202 million for the second quarter and 5% to $420 million for the six months. Diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.56 per share for the second quarter and 5% to $1.16 per share for the six months. On a non-GAAP basis, as I mentioned, just a second ago, adjusted net income increased 6% to $201 million for the second quarter and 7% to $405 million for the six months. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.56 per share for the second quarter and 8% to $1.12 per share for the six months. Note that these two non-GAAP measures, exclude certain discrete tax items previously discussed, refer to the tables if you have any questions about that. Payroll service revenue increased 3% for the second quarter to $441 million and 4% to $892 million for the six months. Advance Partners contributed 1% to the growth in payroll service revenue for both the quarter and year-to-date periods. We benefited from increases in client base and revenue per check, revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting. Payroll client size impacted revenue, as average client size trended modestly lower. We discussed that in the first quarter. We saw a continuation of that trend in the second quarter. While we continue to present payroll service revenue and HRS revenue, I want to emphasize one important point. With the evolving nature of our businesses to an HCM provider, we now offer more product bundles that are bundled with payroll revenue from these bundles as allocated among payroll and HRS. The payroll growth remained steady, but HRS growth reflects the sale of more services to clients in greater revenue per client. And I call out specifically that we have another strong quarter in time and attendance sales. HRS revenue increased 12% to $319 million for the second quarter, 14% to $642 million for the six months. This increase reflects continued growth across our client base and all HCM services, including our comprehensive HR outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance, and HR administration. Within Paychex HR Services, we continue to see strong demand, which is reflected in the double-digit year-over-year growth in the number of client worksite employees served. Insurance services benefited from continued growth in revenue from our SR services, as well as growth in the number of health and benefit applicants. Our workers comp insurance product benefited from higher average premiums and client base growth. Retirement services revenue reflected an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of participant funds, as well as an increase in the number of plans served. Last, Advance Partners contributed a little bit less than 2% to the growth in HRS revenue for both the second quarter and the six months. Investments in income. Turning to our portfolio, our goal is, as you know, to protect principal and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, primary short-term vehicles remain bank demand deposit accounts and variable rate demand notes. In our longer-term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, some corporate bonds and U.S. government securities long-term portfolio has now as an average yield of 1.7%, and an average duration of 3.3 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.2% for the second quarter and six months, up from 1.1% last year. Average investment balances for funds held for clients decreased by approximately 1% year-over-year. As the impact from growth in client base was offset by timing of certain remittances to taxing authorities, we expect that in the second-half of the year that will change and we\u2019ll \u2013 we expect client base, client growth \u2013 clients funds growth, I should say, sorry, to grow about 1%. I\u2019ll now walk you through highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $725 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients as of November 30 were $3.2 billion compared to $4 billion as of May 31. Funds held for clients very widely, as you know, and they average $3.7 billion for both the quarter and the six months. Total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments in funds held for clients reflected net unrealized losses of $16 million as of November 30, compared with a net unrealized gain of $48 million as of May 31. Recently interest rates for intermediate term investors, investments, I should say, have rallied resulting in a decrease in the market value of our portfolio. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $1.8 billion as of November 30, 2016, reflecting $331 million in dividends and $166 million of repurchases of Paychex common stock, a return on equity for the past 12 months was 40%. Cash flows from operations were $413 million for the first six months, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. This decrease was a result of fluctuations in working capital offset by higher net income and non-cash adjustments. Now, let me turn to guidance. We remind you that the outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions. And what I mean by that is, we do factor in the recent Fed rate raise, but we don\u2019t factor in any continuing raises beyond that. We\u2019ll update as we see those. We obviously expect that there will be some, but they\u2019re not baked into this guidance. Payroll service revenue growth is anticipated to be in the range of 3% to 4%. We anticipate payroll revenue growth in the third quarter will be below the range of full-year guidance as we discussed on last quarter\u2019s call. We now expect that it will be approximately 2%. Remember that the third quarter is impacted by one less processing day. HRS revenue growth is anticipated to remain in the range of 12% to 14%. Total service revenue is anticipated to remain in the range of 7% to 8%. Interest on funds held for clients is anticipated to grow in the upper single digits. The impact of the recent increase in short-term rates will be modest, but we be more accretive as we enter into 2018. Operating margins are anticipated to be consistent with the guidance previously provided. The effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 35%. GAAP basis net income growth is expected to be approximately 7%. We said that last quarter, adjusted net income, which is a non-GAAP measure that exclude certain discrete tax items is anticipated to grow approximately 8% consistent with the guidance that we gave in June. I turn it back to Marty. Martin Mucci : Thank you, Efrain. We will now open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : Yes, sir. We will now have the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first one is from Mr. Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Sir, your line is open. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks. Good morning, guys. happy holidays to you. Martin Mucci : Same to you. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks. I just want to start with a question on the Core Payroll segment, just trying to do the math in the back of the more precise outlook on Q3 at the 2% level. I mean, I guess, to get to the midpoint of the full-year 3% to 4% range, it seems lick you\u2019d have to be about 4.5% growth in Q4. So just so we\u2019ve got our models aligned properly, I mean, should we be thinking about the lower-end 3% to 4% [more effectively,] [ph] or are there some real accelerators in Q4, I know you\u2019re not going to have the benefit of Advance anymore, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re disadvantaged in terms of processing days either there? Efrain Rivera : Yes, Jason, I think to call it precisely, it\u2019s a little bit tough, because we need to get through selling. But I think at this point, we\u2019d anticipate we\u2019re towards the lower-end of that range. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, all right, understood. And then just wanted to check on pricing as well, that\u2019s an area to continue to always get questions on. I know you talked about there being some lift from pricing. If it is still in that historical 2% to 4% range, I guess, that would imply that on an organic basis that volumes in core payroll were kind of flat to down, are we thinking about that right? Is 2% to 4% still the right range that you\u2019re seeing on price? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So let me talk about that. So, yes, it is 2% to 4%. This year, it\u2019s probably closer to the lower-end. We\u2019ve been trending somewhere between the low and the mid part of that range. So we still are getting price. We still are getting volume. So our client base is up over last year. And we\u2019ve said, we would be between 1% to 3%, last year we were 2%, we\u2019re in that range. So what accounts for the difference, it is accounted for by the fact that our client \u2013 average client size is a little bit smaller, so to put this in context. If you go back 10 years, go back to 2007, our average client size is 17. But some years, it\u2019s 17.1. Last year we ended at 16.73. And at this point, we are trending slightly down from that number. And so that the effect of that mix is basically taking payroll service revenues down. This happens from time to time. It happens more when two things are present. The first is that, we start to see a flattening in checks for payroll, which is what we\u2019ve been seeing over the last three to four quarters. Actually this quarter, our checks for payroll went negative. So what that means is that and by the way that\u2019s on a same-store basis, I want to clarify that. What that means is that, particularly, our clients in the under 50 space simply aren\u2019t adding a lot of employees at this stage. Will that continue? We\u2019ll see. It\u2019s been bouncing around quarter-to-quarter, and if you look at our index that we publish each month, you\u2019ll see that reflected in the numbers. But that\u2019s part A. And then part B is that, as we sell clients that are a little bit lower than those that we lose, we have this drag effect. In most years that basically is offset by some client checks for payroll growth. This is a year where we\u2019re not seeing that. So we\u2019re monitoring that and saw some of it in Q1 and we\u2019ll see if it continues into Q2 It can bounce around, I would just caution not to assume that that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re going to see through the balance of the year. But we\u2019re assuming at this point some drag in checks for payroll as we go through the year. Martin Mucci : We\u2019re not \u2013 just to add to that a little bit. We\u2019re not \u2013 when you look at last year\u2019s second quarter, there was kind of a push because of the Affordable Care Act, particularly in the mid-market clients. And to get in and buy those services and therefore it got you in the door a lot more sales, and that kind of ticked up the size of the average client, because we sold a little bit more in the mid-market. So it\u2019s an interesting time with the election to see how much the Affordable Care Act last year versus this year had an impact. And because we sold those clients pretty much who needed it. Now, the retention has been very strong on that product even with the uncertainty. But that was higher last year. It got you in the door a lot more in the mid-market, because they were interested in not only the Affordable Care Act, but how you integrated with the payroll services. And so that may have been an impact. And then as Efrain mentioned on our small business index, we\u2019ve seen a flattening out of hiring in the small business sector, the under 50 employees sector, and for a couple of months now, and that could be around the election or not. So it\u2019s kind of an interesting quarter because of the election and the possible changes coming up as well. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just one last one for me. I think in the quarter, you bought back more than twice as many shares as you had bought all of last fiscal year. So wanted to get a sense of whether that\u2019s indicative of any change in the M&A pipeline in terms of the prospects there, either in terms of size of the prospects or potential timing on the prospects? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So the short answer is no. The share repurchase itself was really simply an attempt to get back down to average share count. And if you look at it, we actually were still a little bit high compared to where we were last year. So we\u2019ll do a little bit of \u2013 on an year-to-date basis, we\u2019ll do a little bit more buying just to get back to flat. Now actually, Marty can talk a little bit more about the M&A pipeline, but it\u2019s pretty robust. Martin Mucci : Yes, still pretty active, not always finding exactly what we want, but it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been probably more active from a pipeline standpoint. It\u2019s just whether you get to the final deal or not based on the value and what we find in diligence, but been very active on that front and it hasn\u2019t slowed down at all. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Thanks, again, guys. Martin Mucci : All right. Thanks, Jason. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from James Berkley with Barclays. Your line is open. James Berkley : Hi, guys. Hi, guys, thanks a lot for taking my questions here. Just want to get a better handle on how to think about new revenue growth for 2017. I know you touched on a little bit on the payroll side just now. But through the first-half of the year, you\u2019re near the high-end of your guided ranges on payroll and HRS growth. But this quarter did see the low-end of those ranges, you\u2019ve got Advance Partners lapping one less day in fiscal third quarter questions around the Affordable Care Act and time and attendance, given the delay with the Department of Labor. How do we think about all those moving parts in the back-half of the year, in particular, and what do you think about the ACA and time and attendance, the aspect \u2013 that aspect post-Trump versus previously? Efrain Rivera : Okay, wow, that\u2019s a compound question. So, I\u2019d say, let me just say broadly and then I\u2019ll come back to ACA and other regulatory changes, Marty obviously will have some thoughts on that. But our guidance contemplates all of those issues. Obviously, we just answered a question on payroll services, revenue growth, HRS has remained unchanged. So from that standpoint, we feel comfortable with where we are for the remainder of the year and for the full-year. We don\u2019t focus necessarily on quarters unless there\u2019s some \u2013 something unusual in the quarter that we want to call out like Q3, which has one less day. I feel comfortable about where we are in terms of margins and expenses. So that outlook that we\u2019re providing basically encompasses what we understand the environment to be, don\u2019t anticipate it will change significantly. Now, with respect to ACA and with respect to other changes in regulation, it\u2019s a little bit early to call those. The overtime rules change, at this point don\u2019t see a lot of impact on the balance of the year. It could impact next year and then on what exactly happens with ACA, that\u2019s a question to be answered at this point. What I would say is, if we were to see some sort of a significant movement to repeal starting sometime in late Spring, our anticipation of is that were to rollout over a, let\u2019s say, call it a two to three-year period is that we would see about an impact of 1% on EPS per year. If it was more accelerated, it might be more, but we\u2019re still waiting, that that by the way is more of a worse case scenario, 1% to 1.5% EPS. We think we have other options to replace that revenue. But at this point, we would frame sort of the risk if the ACA got repealed in an orderly fashion. If it got replaced and repealed immediately, that would be a different conversation, we\u2019ll have to wait and see where we end up. Martin Mucci : Yes, I think the expectation, at least, at this point would be, it\u2019s going to take sometime, it\u2019s pretty complicated, as you know, and to change it. So and we\u2019re seeing very solid retention. Of course, clients are looking for us to file in March now for them, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see much movement, at least, through that filing period. And I think it\u2019s going to be a longer thing, which as Efrain mentioned, we\u2019re looking at depending on what happens a number of products. My guess is, clients are still going to have to do something and they\u2019re going to need some support for that. So we feel pretty good that we will be able to adapt to that, might not make up all of the revenue, but it certainly has some opportunity there. From a time and attendance, it\u2019s been interesting that we\u2019ve had very strong sales of our time and attendance solutions. And we\u2019ve introduced the new one that is Flex Essentials, that is a no clock, all web, or mobile punch, much simpler to set up, and we\u2019ve seen an acceleration there. So I think the whole overtime rule issue even though it\u2019s now been delayed and may end up never being enacted who knows has driven a lot of interest in time and attendance. And so that\u2019s driven sales that I don\u2019t think somebody is going to necessarily get rid of that product, and in fact, it may keep kind of a heightened demand now. So I think that\u2019s how we feel about it is pretty good at this point and see what happens next. James Berkley : That makes a lot of sense and thanks for the color on the ACA there. Those numbers are really helpful. Just one more quick follow-up here, more of a high-level question. Just correct me if I\u2019m wrong. I believe about 10% of your company\u2019s revenue is driven by the PEO business, another 10% from the ASO side. I think you got PEO growing more quickly over the last few years. Just curious if you could talk about how fast each is growing the trends that you\u2019ve seen, whether there has been an acceleration recently versus past quarters or past years and just going into more detail on each of those and what\u2019s driving the gap between the two growth rates? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So what we\u2019ve said about the HR outsourcing business is that, it\u2019s about half of HRS revenue and within that half about half is PEO and half is ASO. So that\u2019s what we said and we update that year. our PEO has been growing more quickly than ASO, but both have been growing double-digits. I guess, that\u2019s what we\u2019d say. The only other thing I would add to that is that, because of the PEO, we report healthcare attachment as part of the revenues of the PEO when we get better healthcare attachment in the quarter than you have better PEO growth that really doesn\u2019t have much of an impact on margins. In this quarter, we did not have as significant healthcare attachments we had in the quarter before, but that bounces around every single quarter. So in Q3, we\u2019ll see where we end up. Martin Mucci : Yes, I think we feel pretty good, obviously, reaching the new, the milestone of over a million worksite employees that we\u2019re servicing between our service \u2013 between the ASO and PEO. We feel good. We\u2019re very well-positioned. There\u2019s a lot of demand for the HR support. And I think PEO, while it\u2019s been strong in certain states and we sell it across the pretty much all states, it is starting to continue \u2013 it\u2019s continuing to pick up more demand and we feel good about the future of it. As Efrain said, the attachment of the help can swing from kind of quarter-to-quarter or even month-to-month. But and again, I think, it\u2019s going to be interesting to see kind of what comes out of. Now, you had a quarter, where a lot of discussion about healthcare and you may have a number of clients deciding to kind of hold, wait and see what\u2019s going to happen, but we see good growth. We\u2019ve been doing well in both PEO and ASO, well-positioned to have both products. So if you want co-employment, you have it. If you don\u2019t, we have the insurance agency that\u2019s a top agency and plenty of plans to offer. So feel good about both products right now. James Berkley : Thanks a lot for your color and your time, and happy holidays. Efrain Rivera : Thanks. Same to you. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open. Rayna Kumar : Good morning. This is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. In the first quarter, you really highlighted the strength in the mid-market and that seems to have slowed down a bit in the second quarter. I guess, what\u2019s changed there? And maybe if you can just highlight your expectations for the remainder of the year in the mid-market? Efrain Rivera : Yes, I think in the second quarter, we had a very, very strong quarter a year ago and compares were tougher. We expect that \u2013 we\u2019re expecting a good quarter in the third quarter. And I think, Marty pointed out something that\u2019s important. Last year, there was a drive by many mid-market companies to find integrated solutions that included an ACA compliance solution. A lot of those clients have now selected their solution and the game now is a bit more of competitive takeaway as opposed to selling them on a new solution. There obviously was some of that going on. So we go into third quarter then assuming that we\u2019ll pick up from where we were in Q2. Martin Mucci : Yes, certainly feel great about the product and ever expanding functionality of the product. And I think, as Efrain said, last year was kind of a heightened second quarter with the Affordable Care Act sales, and this year, it\u2019s almost a little bit of the reverse. I think people are being a little careful to make any changes until they see what the rules come out, how it changes, and they\u2019re probably concerned about their filing and making a change and not getting everything filed. So we saw a little bit probably unexpected a little bit slower there, and we expect though once we get past the filing date. So expect a good selling season here, but it may still continue to be a little bit slow through the third quarter until we get past the filing date. We\u2019ll have to see kind of how that shakes out. But we feel certainly good about the product, the competitiveness and going head-to-head with any of the competitors in the market. Rayna Kumar : I guess, besides client behavior, are you seeing any change in the competitive landscape at all? Martin Mucci : No, not really. No, there\u2019s no real new competitors there. We haven\u2019t seen a lot of change in their approach or product. And I think we\u2019ve, as I mentioned, we\u2019ve continued to add new options to our product and more self-service, more analytics that we\u2019ve talked about HR analytics and providing more there mobile-first design, so an increased use of mobile. So we\u2019re feeling very good, very competitive. We have not really seen any change from a competitive marketplace. Rayna Kumar : Great. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful, happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Same to you. Efrain Rivera : Same to you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open. Martin Mucci : Hi, Jim. Jim Schneider : Good morning. Thanks. Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. As many \u2013 as I\u2019m sure, you saw the FIB put up some small business confidence indicators for the month of November, which were essentially stronger after the election than before. I guess, it sounds like from your overall kind of qualitative client commentary that people are still cautious pending any changes in the regulation. Can you give us any kind of additional color on what you\u2019ve been hearing from clients over the last month or month-and-a-half in terms of their optimism on overall business levels and how that kind of matches with your commentary on the rest of the business? Efrain Rivera : Yes, I think it\u2019s exactly, I think it\u2019s optimism, pending action. So I think it\u2019s a lot of optimism on lower corporate tax rates could drive a lot of less expense and more to what they could invest and more employees and so forth. Affordable Care Act looks like those costs could come down for a lot of companies and not forcing them to have the product, but we\u2019ll see. Time and attendance rules, although, it\u2019s a little bit separate, but less regulation, I think overall it\u2019s a very optimistic attitude from the clients, but not necessarily turning that into action yet, because they got to see it. So they\u2019re feeling good about the fact that it looks like there\u2019s going to be a better business environment, consumer confidence is also up and FIB was one of the biggest increases we\u2019ve seen in over the 42-year average for one of the three times, I think, in the last to almost 10 years. So there\u2019s a lot of optimism. But I don\u2019t think, again, they\u2019re turning that into action hiring and so forth, at least, yet until they see kind of what the first few months of the new administration brings. That\u2019s what we\u2019re kind of getting great optimism, but the small business index, at least, for November our last one would show still not a big uptick in hiring kind of at the same growth rate it was last year for, at least, small business. So very positive, but kind of waiting to see what happens. Jim Schneider : That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up, I think last quarter you cited the traction you\u2019re seeing in the 100 to 200 plus kind of segment and the new incremental sales spend you\u2019ve been putting against that. Can you talk about first of all whether there\u2019s any change or in that traction whether you\u2019re seeing continued momentum there? And whether you think the incremental sales spend you put against that is actually adequate at this point, such that, you don\u2019t have to increase it more in the coming quarters? Martin Mucci : Yes, I don\u2019t think, I think we\u2019re adequate. We\u2019re fully staffed and feel very good about being fully staffed and out there. I think the only surprise in the quarter we\u2019ve kind of already mentioned, which is a little bit more in activity to make a change than we saw last year at this time. And I think that would be the only difference, and I think that\u2019s kind of more of a macro kind of issue. And so I think that would be the only change. Certainly feel good about, as I mentioned, the competitiveness. No change really in the competitive environment, and we\u2019re fully staffed and gaining more and more experience on the newer reps that we added at the beginning of the fiscal year. So we\u2019ll be able to talk more about it after the selling season. The only real difference from first quarter, I would say is, with the election, which really change quite rapidly, at least, the view of the election and who won, I think that just put people in a little bit more cautious period for switching anything or making buying decisions in the second quarter. Jim Schneider : That\u2019s fair. And just a quick clarification, if I could. In the quarter itself relative to the plan you had heading into the quarter, would you say that the DOL lack of bookings or the ACA shortfall was kind of the bigger contributor there? Martin Mucci : Well, I don\u2019t \u2013 I think the ACA, I think just the election, if I\u2019m getting your question right, Jim, I think the question or the what happened was with the changes in ACA, with the President, with Trump getting in and probably a little bit more unexpected until second quarter as it got closer to the election, I think people know changes are going to happen. And so they\u2019re a little bit less, they\u2019re a little bit more reluctant to make a change until they see kind of what happens. They\u2019re optimistic, but they\u2019re not sure what\u2019s going to happen yet. And so if that answers your question of the deal. If you\u2019re talking about the overtime rules, I think that was very helpful from an over \u2013 from a selling of our Flex Time and Flex Essentials and our Time clocks, and I think that\u2019s sticking. So the good thing there is, it brought a lot of attention to, you\u2019re to be tracking time, look at the options that are out there now from a technology standpoint, punching in and out on a mobile phone, things that have not been available generally until the last year or so. And I think that\u2019s going to stick, so that actually helped drive some sales that are recorded in our HRS services revenue. And I think that\u2019s going to continue and it\u2019s going to stick no matter what happens with overtime rules. Jim Schneider : Great. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Efrain Rivera : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mr. Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open. Gary Bisbee : Hey, guys, good morning. Martin Mucci : Good morning, Gary. Gary Bisbee : There\u2019s quite a bit of demand about, how much you\u2019ll actually benefit in the short-term float? So I wanted to ask a two-part question to help frame that. The first one, as you think about the float, how you manage the float, is it still right, I know there\u2019s some seasonality, but to think that roughly half of the float balance is short-term stuff, whether it\u2019s money-markets, the variable demand rate notes et cetera, and you target about half in intermediate term bonds? And the second question, if we look at that bond portfolio, I think, you said 3.3-year duration\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Yep. Gary Bisbee : Is the stuff that\u2019s maturing in the next 12 months, are the interest rates that you would likely reinvest that in today above the rates of the stuff that\u2019s maturing, or is that still a negative at this point? Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Hey, good question. So, yes, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s \u2013 short-term is about 45%, can be sometimes 50, but we keep it between 45 and 50. So that reprices immediately or very quickly, I shouldn\u2019t say \u2013 should say. Let me just be careful, that\u2019s an overstatement. It doesn\u2019t reprice immediately. It typically reprices somewhere between 45 to 60 days. So the answer to the first question portfolio composition is yes. That\u2019s correct. And then the second is yes, also. Yes, the bonds that we would invest in going forward currently have yields that are significantly higher than the ones that are rolling off. So if I were to call it today and I\u2019m not doing that, but if I were to call it today, and I assume no more Fed increases other than what we have gotten to this point, the portfolio would be about $8 million higher in value than it is today. I just caution anyone from taking that to the bank, because we\u2019ll have much more granular information once we get through the next couple of quarters and see what the Fed actually does. And the reason why I say that is, we look at and we could give you a big forecast based on yield curves. I distrust that approach. I\u2019d rather tell you what we think our portfolios will do based on what I know at the time I\u2019m saying it, but you can do some math. And the numbers start to get pretty significant, if the Fed does what it says it\u2019s going to do and the final qualification, I\u2019d add to that is the steepness of the yield curve also impacts how we invest. So right now, they do nothing. I\u2019d call it at about $8 million next year, that\u2019s annualized, and we\u2019ll see where we go through the remainder of the year. Gary Bisbee : And just to clarify that that\u2019s very helpful by the way. So the $8 million, that is annualizing and getting the full benefit from the Fed funds rate increase recently and also the benefit from reinvesting bonds at what the current yield curve is, is that correct? Efrain Rivera : Yes, correct. Gary Bisbee : Okay. And then just one other question. The \u2013 and maybe this is just getting too nitpicking on my end, but the buyback was pretty significant no increase in the guidance for earnings, it feels like there\u2019s a couple of pennies there, is that just conservatism or is there some other thing we should think about with that? Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Yes, I guess, I\u2019d say this, Gary. There\u2019s always pluses and minuses, so you have to look at what you think are potential upsides but potential downsides. And I think it\u2019s realistic, I wouldn\u2019t call it aggressive and I wouldn\u2019t call it conservative. Gary Bisbee : Okay. And then just actually one other one. Have you done the analysis and maybe it\u2019s just, we don\u2019t know enough, but about what kind of risk you might face in terms of potential declines in the float portfolio balance is based on some of the personnel income tax changes that Trump and the Republican Congress have been floating? Should we think of that as a potential offset to some of this is the withholding might be less for a significant portion your customers? Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Yes. We haven\u2019t started doing modeling at this point, because at that point the benefit, okay. So that\u2019s coupled with a more bigger a discussion about whether corporate tax rates go down. If that happens then even if we face some drag from personnel income taxes. The corporate tax impact simply dwarfs everything else. So that that we\u2019d look at both. So if tax reform occurs, it\u2019s pretty obvious that we would be a pretty significant beneficiary by significant, I mean, very significant. So we\u2019re waiting to hear like everyone else is waiting to hear. So that\u2019s a partial answer to your question. Gary Bisbee : Yes, great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Happy Holidays. Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Gary. Martin Mucci : Thanks, Gary. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mr. Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open. Bryan Keane : Hi, guys. Just wanted \u2013 a couple clarifications just on HR Services. I think the street was looking for more like 14% revenue growth. I know the guide is 12% to 14% and it came in a little bit towards the lower-end, was there just want to make sure the puts and takes there is what I\u2019m thinking about obviously as Advance Partners acquisition is anniversarying and that contributed two points to growth. So then I\u2019m thinking about the back-half of the year with that coming off, do we have enough in the pipe and in sales to actually increase that growth rate for the back-half? Efrain Rivera : Yes, so Bryan, our guidance obviously included Advance. We came out of the first quarter, I think, we\u2019re at 15% growth. I think I called out attach rates on healthcare in the PEO were a little bit lower than we had projected. That can reverse very, very quickly quarter-to-quarter, so we\u2019ll see where we are in Q3. But in terms of where we expect the year to be, we are not really far off from what we expected. So I see where people might get to 14%. I don\u2019t think our internal plans suggest we be at 14%. And so we should be solidly in the year in the range of the guidance that we provided. And obviously, as you pointed out, the selling season will have an impact on where HRS growth ends up for the year, but we feel comfortable with the range as we\u2019ve given. Bryan Keane : Okay. And then in the back-half since Advance will be now in the numbers that won\u2019t probably push that growth rate, should we think about more towards the lower-end then in that range of 12% to 14% for the back-half as a result of Advance anniversary? Efrain Rivera : I would say, yes, subject to whatever we see in terms of sales in Q \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, in the third quarter, which is where the bulk of the selling season comes in. I would say that, although, I didn\u2019t call out where we end up in Q4, our guidance is for the year as a whole and we feel comfortable for the year as a whole that may not be that or that may be that some quarters aren\u2019t exactly in the range of the guidance. So if it\u2019s significant, we\u2019ll call it out. Bryan Keane : Okay, helpful. And then just time and attendance, how big is that and how fast has that been growing? I know it\u2019s been a \u2013 one of the catalyst that you guys have called out just how big is that as a percentage of revenue and maybe the growth rates you guys have been seeing there? Efrain Rivera : So last time we updated it, it\u2019s about \u2013 it was about last year about 10%, I should say, online services, which includes HR Administration, which is also part of the equation back up a second. So it\u2019s clear the fundamental parts of the HCM platform include an HR Administration module with time and attendance module and obviously a payroll engine module. So about 10% of HRS revenue growth \u2013 revenue is online services. We don\u2019t break it out more than that. That\u2019s been growing at multiples with what payroll has been growing at. Bryan Keane : Okay. Thanks so much and happy holidays, guys. Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Bryan. Martin Mucci : Thanks, Bryan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Sir, your line is open. Kartik Mehta : Hey, good morning, Marty. Good morning, Efrain. Yes, Efrain, I just want to make sure I understood something you said about the float portfolio. I think you said, obviously, if the rates kin of \u2013 the Fed did nothing, it would be about $8 million. I seem to remember, I thought in the queue you said a 25 basis points would mean after-tax net income of $3.5 million to $4 million. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Kartik Mehta : And so that $8 million, is there some tax impact to that, that would be different, or did I \u2013 am I missing something that you might have said or misinterpreting? Efrain Rivera : No, no, you\u2019re just missing some information, so which I didn\u2019t provide in my estimate. So our disclosure is that a 25 basis point rise impacts the portfolio immediately on an annualized basis to the tune of about $3.5 million, $3.7 million, I believe it is. But that doesn\u2019t end the conversation, because then the question you have to ask yourself is, what does it do to long-term rates? If in the end, your reinvestment for long-term rates stays the same, it\u2019s done nothing. You\u2019ve gotten a benefit on the short-term portion of the portfolio, but very little else. The benefit we\u2019re getting right now and I \u2013 the reason why I caution about including any interest rate benefit in models yet is that the securities that we invest in intermediate term municipals have gone up pretty significantly since the election, so our reinvestment rate is higher than it is right now. So if all we got was a 3.5 basis point, I\u2019m sorry, a 25 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate. You could expect that we would get roughly what we say we would get. But we\u2019re also getting a bit of a benefit on the long-term portion of the portfolio. And what I don\u2019t know now and I\u2019ll have a better sense is that, the Fed keeps raising interest rates. What\u2019s happening to the shape of that yield curve as I go out over the maturities that we have to reinvest. So right now, if everything held, I\u2019d be about \u2013 on an annualized basis about $8 million higher. What it will end up being, I don\u2019t know until I get to the spring and I can digest the other Fed rate increases. Kartik Mehta : Okay. That makes sense. So, I guess, Efrain, will you invest a little bit differently considering the Fed might do a couple of more rate increases, so will the philosophy change at all, or will you still continue to manage the portfolio like you have? Efrain Rivera : That is a discussion that we\u2019re going to have as we get into the spring, because if the shape of the yield curve is steep around the long end, then maybe I have a less short-term cash, and I have more long. I haven\u2019t made that decision and we haven\u2019t had that discussion yet. We\u2019ve had some preliminary conversations about how we would do that, but obviously that would be one way to get higher yield even than what I\u2019m talking about on the portfolio, those are decisions that we need to look at when we get into the spring. Obviously, competitors leverage 100%. We\u2019d never \u2013 we\u2019ve chosen not to do that. But between where we are and where other people in the market are, there is room to move if we chose to do so. Kartik Mehta : And, Marty, as you\u2019re going into the selling season, how many payroll salespeople do you have compared to last year, is it same, less or more than you\u2019ve had last year at this time? Efrain Rivera : Yes, up 2% or 3% from a headcount perspective and fully staffed. And I think just getting those reps up to speed, but we\u2019re up about 2% or 3%, which is fairly normal for us and it\u2019s kind of across both small and mid-market. Kartik Mehta : And where do you stand in terms of salespeople attrition today compared to what it has been in the past? Efrain Rivera : Yes, a very consistent, as some are better than others. Actually some of the mid-market, I think, tends to be a little bit better than it has been historically even, and core payroll tend to be very consistent with or it\u2019s been, no big uptick in turnover anything. Kartik Mehta : And just one last question, Marty, you moved over to Flex, obviously, the transition seems to be going well. Have you seen an impact on cross sales because of customers moving to Flex either more or less in terms of product sales? Martin Mucci : Yes. Well, obviously, from a Flex standpoint, you\u2019ve got a better integration there and we\u2019ve built everything to integrate into that and then continue to roll things out with Flex, so we\u2019re certainly seeing better pick up from a penetration. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s huge, but it certainly is a bigger pick up in penetration when you\u2019re selling the Flex platform, because everything is built around that, so and we still have a lot of room to grow there. So when you think of the HR analytics that we just rolled out kind of at HR Tech and some of the other products like just rolling out Flex Essentials, which is that kind of lower-end time and attendance solution without clocks, all of that is around Flex. So we expect to have better penetration growth because of the Flex platform and the more we roll it out to clients. Kartik Mehta : Okay. Hey, thank you very much Efrain and Marty. Martin Mucci : Okay, thanks. Efrain Rivera : Yes, happy holidays. Kartik Mehta : Same to you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Mr. Tim McHugh with William Blair. Sir, your line is open. Tim McHugh : Thanks. Hi, guys. Just want to ask digging back on to the comment about seeing, I guess, a trend towards a smaller average client size. You\u2019ve talked a little bit about various parts of this, but just to be clear, are you seeing, I guess, slower growth in the middle market and that\u2019s why the average is skewing down or faster growth in small, or I guess, peel back for us why the average is trending smaller than it was in the past? Efrain Rivera : I\u2019d say this, Tim, that right now the relative growth between small is tilting a little bit more towards small versus mid and last year, it was tending a little bit more \u2013 trending a little bit more mid than small. So I think that\u2019s what it is. Look, I could also talk about losses and sales, but when you net it all out, that\u2019s basically what you\u2019re seeing. And by the way, I just want to make it clear, our average client size has been 17 for the last 10 years, it\u2019s not a dramatic difference, but a 10 or 15 basis points there does make a difference. Martin Mucci : Yes, not a huge change, but as Efrain said, it makes a difference. But I think the point we made earlier both Efrain and I think, last quarter, Tim, what we saw was, there was more movement in the mid-market because of Affordable Care Act and the need. That got people to change and sell more. This one has been compared to last quarter that need has kind of been satisfied by those who have it. And while we\u2019re holding certainly the clients we have with Affordable Care Act products, we\u2019re not seeing the interest in saying, okay, I want to change, because I have to have something in place. So we saw a little bit of a shift second quarter over second quarter and again, it\u2019s not a huge number, but it did drop the average size a little bit. Tim McHugh : Okay. So it\u2019s fair. It seems like middle market because of that comp issue isn\u2019t \u2013 probably isn\u2019t growing as fast, is small necessarily growing faster, or is it just it\u2019s growing at the same rate and you\u2019re not seeing quite as much growth in middle market and feel that average is, that brings the average down? Efrain Rivera : Small is growing faster. Tim McHugh : Faster than it was before? Efrain Rivera : It\u2019s growing faster Tim McHugh : Okay. Just when you say faster, sorry, just faster than middle market, or are you saying faster than in the past? Efrain Rivera : It\u2019s growing faster than middle market. I would say, it\u2019s pretty comparable to where we were a year or so ago. Tim McHugh : Okay. And that\u2019s helpful. What was the \u2013 last, can you give us \u2013 give remind us of the split between middle market and small, I guess, in that payroll part of it? Efrain Rivera : Yes, we don\u2019t give the actual payroll dollars associated with it. It\u2019s complicated and the reason we all do that is a lot of ancillaries are primarily mid-market clients. Our client base in the mid-market is about a little bit over 6% of our total clients. And you can assume that the from a revenue standpoint, that\u2019s three to four times what our client base is, if that helps. Tim McHugh : Okay. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much. I know it\u2019s late, I just have a quick one. Efrain, you mentioned that if corporate tax rates go down, you think you\u2019d be, I think you used the word significant beneficiary. Can you just remind us right now roughly what your federal tax rate is? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Our federal tax is about 33% and we obviously pay pretty close to the statutory rate. It depends on whose estimate you\u2019re looking at. And if you\u2019re down in 20% corporate tax rate, we are a significant beneficiary but even 5 to 10 point decrease would create significant benefits for us. Jeff Silber : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you so much. Efrain Rivera : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Glenn Greene : Thank you. Good morning. Just a few clarifications on previous commentary but maybe Marty going back to the sales activity, horning in on your comment little bit more inactivity or less slower mix, your buying decisions and switching, is that how you\u2019re contemplating the upcoming obviously key selling season, meaning the factor is that the new administration we are not going to know the new rules or and whatever they may do is not going to known really until the end of the selling season. So are you sort of preparing for a difficult sales season? Martin Mucci : Well, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s difficult. I just say \u2013 this was compared really to last year, so we saw more activity. So we\u2019re \u2013 I mean, we\u2019re expecting a pretty good selling season, but it was certainly a little bit slower in Q2 than it was last year. Even though things are known, I think it\u2019s just \u2013 last year we had a lot of sales, we had more mid market sales in the second quarter because they had to get, they had to make some change to get the Affordable Care Act product. By this point, most of those had bought it by November when you think about last year because they had to get in and actually many of us stopped selling it after November because we had to get them taking care for the calendar year. So I wouldn\u2019t say we are expecting a difficult sales season but they may be a little bit more inactivity than we saw last year. But I would expect most of that was in Q2 last year. Glenn Greene : Okay. Efrain, on the buyback, I think it\u2019s pretty clear but the uptick in the buyback the 2.9 million shares this quarter, we shouldn\u2019t be thinking any change in your buyback mentality rest assure more just to get the share count closer to where it was a year ago is what I was hearing. Efrain Rivera : Yes. That\u2019s right Glenn. That\u2019s where we are in. Glenn Greene : And then just to clarify on the ACA obviously a risk and you sort of identified what the risk could be, but what\u2019s the order of magnitude? What percentage of revenue ACA is right now? Efrain Rivera : I think I was asked this last year so I\u2019m going to call it direct ACA revenue is in a little bit above between 1% and 1.5% of revenue. Glenn Greene : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Rick Eskelsen with Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is open. Rick Eskelsen : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just a quick one clarify from the release and your comments, I noticed you didn\u2019t mention anything about the operating income excluding float, have you changed how you\u2019re thinking about operating margin and operating income here? Efrain Rivera : Not really. I think you can basically do much of the math yourselves and because float is no longer a drag. It\u2019s probably more useful to just look at it in totality. Rick Eskelsen : Thanks. And then just the next one, Marty, you did mention about regulatory changes, do you see it as a benefit for the business overall? I guess if you could just talk about the components of your business and where you saw the most, from client perspective, where they did more on the regulatory driven work? Did it drive more people to do PEO or ASO? Did it drive more bundles? Was there any split within the business on the regulatory pressure and what it drove clients to do? Thank you. Martin Mucci : Sure. I think first, I think I would say overtime \u2013 the overtime rules they have now of course been postponed at least temporarily. That drove certainly a lot more interest from clients in time and attendance solution. So that\u2019s been helpful to get in front of clients and offer them a great timing for us in the product suite that we have. So that drove a lot of interest and frankly still I think it geared up a lot of interest that whether the overtime rules going to affect or not I think it\u2019s going to be a plus for us. When you start talking about overtime rules that also drags in HR, so whether it was ASO or PEO, that brought a lot of interest in HR support. So companies that would have said, hey, I\u2019m going to continue to try to deal with the HR myself internally, now said jeez I think with all these overtime rules who is exempted, who isn\u2019t a lot more discussion about moving people to exempt doing that based on the overtime rules brought in some HR sales as well both on the ASO and PEO platform. And then I think a little bit probably of a drag might have been the fact that okay, now the Affordable Care Act as we\u2019ve said is up in the air, but what\u2019s going to happen? Maybe I don\u2019t rush to buy as much from an insurance or a PEO side do I need it or not. So I think those were the major changes. I think right now what we expect is less regulation based on the platforms of the Trump administration but I think there still going to be an enough change that those things will still help us. And in fact just the level of change makes people worry about can they keep up with everything. If the tax rates change, if the rules change and maybe when to file, if overtime is in or out, that all drives people to say, okay, I can\u2019t keep up with that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to an outsourcer like Paychex who has over 200 people who just track compliance and realize what has to happen and so forth. So I think those have been the pluses and minuses. Rick Eskelsen : Thank you very much. Martin Mucci : Okay. Efrain Rivera : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, your line is open. David Ridley-Lane: Good morning. In the discussion around average client size, I didn\u2019t hear you mention should payroll, is that a piece that\u2019s also having a potential drag on the average client size? Efrain Rivera : So payroll is part of the equation. It\u2019s been part of the equation in the last five years. They continue to do well. So that\u2019s part of the mix of what we sell. So we sell through payroll, we sell obviously through our Paychex\u2019s outsource service and we also sell midmarket, so that\u2019s part of the mix. David Ridley-Lane: Understood. And then if you\u2019ve \u2013 it sounds like you\u2019ve fully staffed up on sales headcount. I assume you preset an operation, should we be expecting a bit stronger margin expansion in the second half of this fiscal year? Efrain Rivera : No because the first part of the statement David is correct. So we are fully staffed and operations expenses year-over-year were up pretty significantly in the quarter, we called out some reasons for that, that compare gets a little bit easier as we go through the remainder of the year. But remember that expenses in Q3 and in Q4 but Q3 particularly increased because of the volume of operations activity that we have and also the volume of sales activity that we have. So no in the back half of the year, you see our financials the margin actually goes down and that\u2019s typical of our pattern. David Ridley-Lane: I guess I was thinking more of an margins on a year-over-year basis? Efrain Rivera : On a year-over-year basis. David Ridley-Lane: Yes, sorry. Efrain Rivera : We feel comfortable with the guidance and obviously we\u2019re running actually little bit ahead of it in the first half but comfortable where we are in terms of margins at this point. David Ridley-Lane: Understood. Thank you very much. Efrain Rivera : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Mr. Mark Marcon with R.W. Baird. Sir, your line is open. Mark Marcon : Happy holidays, Efrain and Marty. Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Mark. Martin Mucci : Thanks, Mark. Same to you. Mark Marcon : Couple of quick questions. First one, with regards to the general environment that you\u2019re seeing in the small business arena, what do you see in terms of new business start-ups in terms of trickling up from the field source of new clients? And then what are you seeing in terms of bankruptcies and how that seems to be trending? Martin Mucci : On new business start-ups, I think they\u2019ve reached back to that level and that they were pre-recession. We\u2019ve seen that now for probably a year and I think they\u2019ve held everything that we\u2019ve seen would say, they\u2019re not growing tremendously more than that but they\u2019re right in that place where they were. Bankruptcies generally pretty consistent where they have been, maybe up a little at least what we\u2019ve seen. What we see is from our losses to bankruptcies and out of business, and that picked up slightly but again our overall retention is very consistent with where it\u2019s been, at pretty record high levels pretty consistent in that range. So no big change there but a little bit tick up in the bankruptcies, which is interesting. It doesn\u2019t seem like that should happen but we\u2019ve seen a few more losses because of that, nothing that would change our overall number. Mark Marcon : Okay. And then with regards to you had great improvement with regards to Flex as it relates to the smaller end of the market, from a technology perspective, can you lay out any additional improvements that we should expect out of the 50 to 1,000 range in terms of what you are offering there? Martin Mucci : Okay. I think you will continue to see that level of integration and you\u2019ll see a big continued push on few things. One is the analytics piece that we just talked about at HR Tech much more on the analytics both in the way we report the data and in the flexibility the client has. The other will be continue to be a mobile first design and we are seeing a good uptick in mobile usage, as I\u2019ve mentioned before not only the client but from the employee standpoint. So we are spending a lot of time adjusting our language and our display much more now \u2013 pretty much over 99% of the display is HTML5 so it\u2019s a much cleaner and easier use for the client, much more flexible for the client and the employees on mobile use but we\u2019ve stuck our long ways to go on mobile adoption so getting the client and their employees to download the app and use it. It\u2019s growing fast but we still got a long way to go and I think that\u2019s going to be big part of assisting in the value of our products and services. A full suite is there and we are constantly adding to it like the new Flex Time Essentials and you\u2019ll see a lot more paperless. So everything pretty much can be paperless today right even PEO on boarding now is all paperless function. So I think you will continue to see us add to the functionality and even in time and attendance we are adding new modules all the time. So a budgeting module we just added where you will be able to track your time to your budget and so forth. So you\u2019re going to continue to see not only the products expand but the modules within each distinct product. Mark Marcon : That\u2019s great. And I mean is there going to be a step function Marty in terms of by the end of calendar 2017 we should see, we did have step functions on the smaller side that were some real benchmarks that we ended up fitting. Do we see something similar to that coming up? Martin Mucci : You mean a benchmark from a penetration standpoint or? Mark Marcon : Right. Martin Mucci : Yes, I think so. Although it\u2019s much more gradual now like \u2013 the number of the clients are on Flex. I think we certainly have internal goals as to where we want that penetration to be including mobile adoption. So you will see more marketing push mobile adoption. You\u2019ll see more direct \u2013 I think trying to get the employees of the clients and more marketing from that standpoint. So we don\u2019t really disclose it but we certainly internally have our steps that we want to get to our different goals by year for penetration of those products. And I think right now we are on track I think even a little ahead on time and attendance because of the overtime rules. Mark Marcon : Great. And then on the PEO, you basically mentioned that that\u2019s going a little bit faster than ASO and it sounds like the momentum continue to be very good and at that same time we have a bit of a pause with regards to the regulatory uncertainty because of the administration change. But it didn\u2019t sound like your commentary would suggest that you would expect any sort of slow down on the just the core PEO, did I interpret that correctly? Martin Mucci : I think so. Yes, we\u2019ve seen that pretty consistent growth from the PEO standpoint and I think we feel very good about the career plans we\u2019re offering now and the work with the careers. And so, yes, I don\u2019t think that will necessarily slow down. We\u2019ve just seen that inactivity, a little bit of slowness in making a change in some clients who already have it but I think you\u2019ll see and even with more certification and things that are going on in that industry I think you could see a pick up there and there is no real change in competition. We haven\u2019t seen any real change from any of the competitors from the PEO standpoint. So if you have good plans, great HR service and support and good career plans, insurance plans, we should continue to see good double digit growth there. Mark Marcon : Great. And then with regards to your sales people and particularly some of your eliminate who may have left, are you seeing some come back? Martin Mucci : Yes, I guess some. I wouldn\u2019t say any major thing. We certainly have seen where people might jump to a competitor. We\u2019ve seen a few of those come back. I wouldn\u2019t say anything in large number but really with the attrition as I mentioned earlier, the turnover has been pretty consistent so we haven\u2019t seen any uptick in turnover and I think \u2013 there isn\u2019t many major exodus for anybody to come back. Yes, some come back but not too many. Mark Marcon : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Thanks, Mark. Same to you. Mark Marcon : Hey, could I ask one more, Marty? I forgot. Martin Mucci : Sure. Mark Marcon : Just on the tax filing float, to what percentage of the tax filing float is actually due to the tax withholdings for federal and state income taxes relative to things like SUTA and things of that nature? Martin Mucci : Well, Mark, that\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s primarily federal and state, SUTA does have an impact, but the bigger impact is federal and state. Mark Marcon : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Martin Mucci : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from Mr. Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Sir, your line is open. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thank you. Hi, Mark and Efrain, happy holidays from me as well. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Considering I\u2019m standing between you guys and the holiday party, let me hurry up with the questions. So M&A pipeline, you mentioned healthy M&A pipeline, is it possible to potentially qualify that? Is it going to be more what I\u2019d consider distribution, things like advance partners, staffing, outsourcing or more product? Martin Mucci : I would say little bit of both, but probably less product these days and more expansion of what we have. So certainly payroll PEO, other off suites of what \u2013 we like the Advance Partners, obviously that\u2019s been very good acquisition for us, good team there and there is some opportunities there as well in that industry. And so I would say across the board probably a little bit less product, but there is some product things we still want to do but we\u2019ve pretty much build those \u2013 the majority of those tuck in type opportunities, mostly what we are looking for now and different geographies obviously as well. We are always looking particularly in Western Europe for opportunities as well and so I\u2019d say it\u2019s a little bit across the board. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. And then if taxes go down as they\u2019re expected to, would you expect to look for investment alternative other than you do a lot of treasury in muni, so the muni part\u2026 Martin Mucci : Right, Ashwin. Good point. Yes, so open the universe up to other class of assets that we wouldn\u2019t think about as much today. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Any initial thoughts on how you\u2019re thinking about that? Martin Mucci : Yes, obviously you look at taxables a lot more than we do today. So we begun to have some of those conversations without getting too presumptuous about what\u2019s going to happen with respect to taxes? Ashwin Shirvaikar : Okay, got it. And some helpful clients have typically grown in the mid 20-ish type of range sequentially into the Feb quarter with bonuses and so on. Would you expect that to be fairly consistent this year? Martin Mucci : I think the pattern should be fairly consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in prior years. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Okay. Last quick question, the DOL rule timing, what was the specific assumption you are already making in the outlook for this or whether it\u2019s not in the outlook so it doesn\u2019t matter? Martin Mucci : There is no real specific assumption there. While it\u2019s been significant sales and time and attendance, it is enough to move the needle that much or it doesn\u2019t change our guidance or anything, we wouldn\u2019t. If that never went into effect, we wouldn\u2019t change guidance or adjust guidance or anything. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Understood. That\u2019s all from me. Happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Thank you, Ashwin. Take care. Operator : And we don\u2019t have any more questions on queue, sir. Speakers, you may proceed. Martin Mucci : Okay, great. Thank you. At this point, we will close the call. If you are interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 30 days. I thank you for taking the time to participate in our second quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. We wish you all a very happy holiday season. Thank you. Operator : And that conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect now. Now, I will turn the meeting over to your host, Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin. Martin Mucci : Thank you and thank you for joining us for the discussion of Paychex Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2017. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. And you can access our earnings release and the Form 10-Q on our Investor Relations webpage. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about 30 days. On today\u2019s call, I will update you on the results of our business in the third quarter and Efrain will review our financial results and discuss our full year guidance. After that, we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Our third second quarter results mark continued progress across our major product lines. Total service revenue for the third quarter grew 6% year-over-year. Our cloud-based HCM, human capital management services, continued to show strong growth. We are encouraged by the growth in small business optimism that\u2019s occurred in the recent months and our latest Paychex IHS Small Business Jobs Index has shown an improving pace of employment growth since the election. With three months of improvement, we anticipate a continuation of jobs growth and the administrations agenda advocates for lower taxes and fewer regulations, which we hope will likely lead to a more robust environment for small businesses including investment in HCM solutions. We are confident that we are well-positioned to support our clients in successfully navigating through many future changes we expect on the horizon. On March 24th, House Republicans abandoned the proposed bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Therefore, the requirements including the need for health insurance offerings for employees of applicable large employers, the annual compliance filings and the penalties remain in place for the foreseeable future. We have been successful in responding to these needs for our clients and have maintained a good client retention level for these services, and we now expect that to continue. We have recently announced the expansion of our portfolio of partners and solutions that provide investment and administrative fiduciary protection to 401(k) plan sponsors. With these services, we are making it easier for advisers and plan sponsors to offer investment options in their 401(k) plan that allow them to keep up with the demand of the ever-changing regulatory landscape. Our clients can now choose from a suite of fiduciary response solutions to help them with a complicated investment selection process by outsourcing to professional firms. We\u2019re very proud of our leadership position in this 401(k) recordkeeping space and will continue to make enhancements for our clients to keep our leadership. During the third quarter, we experienced some mixed results for payroll sales. These results reflected progress in the small market sales and a continuation of the trends in the mid-market that we discussed in the second quarter call. Mid-market payroll sales decreased from the high level of activity experienced a year ago, which were driven in part by the Affordable Care Act requirements. Compared to a year ago, this has impacted the number and size of clients sold during the selling season. Our complete HR outsourcing solutions have continued to demonstrate strong growth in the marketplace. And as noted previously, we are serving about 1 million worksite employees through a combination of our HR Services. For all of our products, we maintain our focus and continuous improvement in our Software-as-a-Service technology platforms, value-added service offerings and operational efficiencies. This year, enhancements to our Paychex Flex platform, including mobile offerings, HR analytics, time and attendance solutions and paperless on-boarding of new employees, has helped drive increased adoption of our mobile app and double-digit growth of our time and attendance solutions. In December, we were honored with the Brandon Hall Group bronze medal for the second year in a row. This award recognized Paychex Flex for the Best Advance in HR or workforce management technology for small and medium-sized businesses. Paychex also received other important recognition in the third quarter. For the ninth time, we were honored to be named a World\u2019s Most Ethical Company by Ethisphere Institute. I\u2019m extremely proud of this award, proud of the integrity of our 14,000 employees who make it a point to do the right thing every day for our -- their clients, coworkers and the communities in which we live. Also, our training organization were honored to be ranked number 20 on the list of the top 125 training organizations by Training magazine, up 11 spots over the last year. The employees in the Paychex Learning and Development Center do an amazing job, providing more than 1 million hours -- training hours over the last fiscal year. Learning and development is a large part of the culture here at Paychex, and we take pride in the outstanding programs created and delivered by this team of talented individuals. We also celebrated the one year anniversary of Advance Partners acquisition in December and remain very pleased with the contributions that team has brought to our Company. Their performance has been strong, and we look forward to the growing opportunities that are in store for them. In summary, we marked another quarter of progress and growth, and I appreciate the great work and efforts of our Paychex employees and management team during a busy calendar yearend and selling season. I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks and good morning to everyone. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events; remember the customary disclosures. As Marty indicated, third quarter financial results for fiscal 2017 showed continued progress and growth. Here are some of the key highlights for the third quarter and nine months. I\u2019ll provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap with a review of our 2017 outlook including a look forward to what we expect in Q4. Total service revenue grew 6% for the third quarter to $783 million and 7% for the nine months to $2.3 billion. Interest on funds held for clients increased 11% for the third quarter and 8% for the nine months to $13 million and $37 million respectively. These changes were primarily driven by slightly higher average interest rates earned. Expenses increased 4% for the third quarter and 6% year-to-date. The expense growth in both periods was impacted by higher wages and related comp expenses due to growth in headcount in our operations area primarily. Expense growth was moderated or tempered by lower variable selling cost. Our operating margin was 38.5% for the third quarter and 40% year-to-date, improving from 37.2% and 39.6% for the respective prior year periods. The improvement in the third quarter was aided by lower variable selling expense as I mentioned. We continue to maintain industry-leading margins while investing in our operations. Our effective income tax rate was 34.2% for the third quarter and 34.1% for the nine months compared to 36% and 33.9% for the respective periods last year. The lower effective income tax rates in fiscal 2017 are due to discrete tax items. In fiscal 2017, we implemented new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based compensation. This has resulted in discrete tax benefits recognized upon exercise or lapse of stock-based awards. The impact of discrete tax benefits year-to-date increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.05. In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, looking back to last year, we recognized a net tax benefit on income from prior years -- prior tax years related to customer facing software we produced. This drove the lower tax rate for the nine-month period. So, when you look at it, we\u2019ve got a table in the press release that reconciles the two; they largely offset each other year-over-year. Net income increased 12% to $203 million for the third quarter and 7% to $622 million for the nine month. Diluted EPS also increased 12% to $0.56 per share in the third quarter and 7% to $1.71 per share for the nine months. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income increased 10% to $199 million for the third quarter and 8% to $605 million for the nine months. Adjusted diluted earnings per share also increased 10% to $0.55 per share for the third quarter and 8% to $1.66 per share for the nine months. Note that these two non-GAAP measures exclude the discrete items previously mentioned. Please refer to the press release for a discussion of the non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation to the related measures under GAAP build out clearly in a table in the press release again. Payroll revenue, it increased 2% for the third quarter to $447 million and 3% to $1.3 billion year-to-date. We benefitted from increases in client base and revenue per check. Revenue per check grew as a result of price increases net of discounting. The 2% growth in the third quarter was tempered by approximately 1% due to one less processing day compared to the prior year period. The year-to-date payroll service revenue growth of 3% includes the impact of Advance Partners. The impact of Advance Partners on the year-to-date payroll service revenue growth was partially offset by the impact of one less processing day compared to the prior year period. And when you net both of them, we get increase of about 0.5% to the overall growth rate. Similar to the emphasis I made last quarter, with the evolving nature of our business to an HCM service provider, our offerings of bundled products to our customers have increased revenue from those bundles that\u2019s allocated among the payroll and interest, payroll growth remains steady in the low-single-digits but HRS revenue growth reflects the sales of more service to the client and the greater revenue per client, average client sites trended down slightly, impacting overall payroll revenue growth. HRS increased 12% to $336 million for the third quarter and 13% amounted to $978 million for the nine months. The increase reflects continued growth in our client base across all major HCM services including our comprehensive HR outsourcing services, retirement, attendance, and HR administration. Retirement services also reflected an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the asset value participant fund. Insurance services benefit from continued growth in revenue from our ACA compliance service, as well as growth in the number of health and benefit applicants along with our higher average premiums and an increase in our workers\u2019 compensation product. For the nine months, the impact of Advance Partners was approximately 1.5% on the growth of HRS revenue. Investments and income, our goal is the same as it\u2019s always been to protect principal and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, primary short-term vehicles are bank demand positive accounts and variable rate demand notes. In our longer term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.3 years currently. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.2% for both the third quarter and the nine months, up from 1.0% and 1.1% respectively from the prior year period. In December 2016, the Fed funds rate was increased by 25 basis points and Fed again increased the interest rate by another 25 basis points in early March. Average investment balances for funds held for clients were relatively flat for the third quarter and down approximately 1% year-to-date. The impact from growth in the client base was offset by timing of certain remittances to taxing authorities. I\u2019ll now walk you through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $844 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients were -- as of the end of the quarter were $4.8 billion, compared to $4 billion as of May 31, 2016. Funds held for clients very-widely, as you all know, and on a day-to-day basis; they averaged $4.5 billion for the third quarter $4.0 billion for the nine months. Our total available for sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $9 million as of the end of the quarter compared with net unrealized gains of $48 million as of May 31, 2016. The fluctuation is related to changes in market rates of interest on intermediate bonds. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $1.9 billion as of February 28th, reflecting $497 million in dividends paid and $166 million of repurchases of Paychex common stock. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a sterling 41%. Our cash flows from operations were $769 million for the first nine months, a decrease of 3% from the prior year period. The decrease was the result of fluctuations in working capital offset by higher net income and non-cash adjustments. Let\u2019s turn to fiscal 2017 guidance for the remainder of the year. We remind you that our outlook is based upon our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continue with no significant changes. Our guidance for the full year is as follows. Full year payroll service revenue growth is anticipated to be at the low end to the range of 3% to 4% that we previously provided. In addition, we anticipate payroll revenue growth in the fourth quarter will be below the range of full year guidance and will be approximately 2%. Full year HRS revenue growth is anticipated to remain in the range of 12% to 14%. We anticipate HRS revenue growth in the fourth quarter will be in the range of 10% to 11%. Full year total service revenue is expected to remain in the range of 7% to 8%, albeit at the low end. Full year increase on funds held for clients is anticipated to increase in the upper single-digit. The impact of the recent increases in short-term rates will be modest for the balance of the year, but will become more accretive in fiscal 2018. Operating margins are anticipated to be consistent with guidance previously provided. Our effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 35%. GAAP basis, net income growth is anticipated to be approximately 7%. Adjusted net income, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes discrete items -- discrete tax items, is anticipated to grow approximately 8%. This is consistent with the guidance that we have previously given in June. Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Marty. Martin Mucci : Okay. Thanks, Efrain. Operator, we\u2019ll now open up the call to any questions or comments. Operator : Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question coming from the line of Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open. Danyal Hussain : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just on the mixed results in sales. Can you talk about how it came against your expectations? And then in that context, you called out, Efrain, the lower variable sales expenses. So again, is this a function of just a tough comp from last year on sales or is it lower sales versus your expectations, not [indiscernible] leverage in that line? Thanks. Martin Mucci : Yes. I\u2019ll start. This is Marty. I think what we saw, as I mentioned, was small market was fine and mid-market was a little slower than we anticipated. And I would say, certainly down -- decreased from last year, but we knew that there was a real bump in second and third quarters for Affordable Care Act sales, our ESR -- our employee, our services product there, and to help with ACA. And I think that drove a lot of payroll sales and other products as well. And that seemed to have some impact this year a little bit in slowing it down. So, I think down from last year because of the kind of the frenzy of ACA buying and so a little bit slower in the mid-market than we thought. Efrain Rivera : I think Danyal, the demand environment was different than what we thought it would be when we came into the year, to Marty\u2019s point, as we were exiting the year, we thought not only would there be increased demand over what we saw with ACA but we built our plans based on that assumption. And what we saw in the -- starting in the second quarter with the comments that Marty gave, was we started to see more hesitancy; and then as we went into third quarter, it was clear that demand environment was different than what we were in, last year. And as a consequence of that, mid-market sales, the comments that Marty made about mid-market sales were what we saw. On the smaller end of the market, the market looked pretty robust; we did very well but it was a bit -- that scenario was a little bit different than what we had anticipated going into the year. Danyal Hussain : Okay, thanks. And then, I don\u2019t know if you have much data at this point. But, has there been any change over the last week since the vote? Martin Mucci : No, not really. What we were talking about there is that last year, not only did they drive Affordable Care Act product sales, but I think it drove decision-making in payroll -- in payroll products time and attendance kind of everything, it was at the same time, everything is well integrated from one service provider. And so, we saw that bump last year. So, not only did we have the Affordable Care Act product sales up last year as people needed to have the product in place, but they were making other buying decisions that I think actually got pulled forward to some degree. Then, what we projected this year, we, as Efrain just mentioned, we didn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think we saw that as much of a blip because of Affordable Care Act as it turned out to be. And so, we\u2019re kind of -- we got down to a more normalized kind of mid-market kind of buying and something plus. And I think you have the election on top of it and the new administration and it seems like in general, businesses is in the -- particularly in the mid-market size are being a little hesitant to what exactly do they have to do. For a while, they would have thought they would have a -- they would kind of drop their insurance, if they didn\u2019t want to do it. And now of course that\u2019s reversed. And so, I think there is just a lot of kind of state of flux right now with many businesses. Danyal Hussain : Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open, sir. Gary Bisbee : Yes, thank you. And I guess on -- did you see in the year-end season, any change in the decision of your PEO customers to take your insurance offerings? And so, is there any revenue trajectory we should think for the new calendar year? Any impact of that like lower pass-throughs or anything? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I think you\u2019ll see a little bit of it. I think there is -- that\u2019s part of the reason why I called third quarter at 10% to 11%. So, we\u2019ve seen a little bit less pass-through but I would say, it\u2019s uneven, Gary. We\u2019ve signed some pretty big clients that had healthcare attachment too. But, overall, the trend\u2019s been lower attachment this year. Gary Bisbee : Okay. And then, you guys cited at the beginning some of the optimistic data, like your small business survey. And we\u2019ve seen a lot of those forward-looking data points be very optimistic, the NFIB has been on fire. But yet I think a lot of a real hard data in the economy hasn\u2019t really seen that optimism. How are you thinking about that? Do you think that your customers are going to need to see Washington get some of the pro growth policies done before they change or in the small end or you\u2019re actually seeing those optimism surveys and you\u2019re new hiring survey and all of that start to flow through into tangible bookings at this point? Martin Mucci : Yes. At this point, Gary, as you said, the optimism has been very high off the charts, and our survey, or our index for the last three months has shown increasingly small business hiring is up. Now, it\u2019s interesting when you dig into that it is -- we\u2019re seeing more part-time jobs kind of coming back. Others -- what we would classify as other services, discretionary services and some construction in pockets where it\u2019s like in the southeast and so forth. So, we\u2019re not seeing a real big jump in our own clients other than the fact that it\u2019s slowly increasing. And I do think that given especially the last 90 days or so, I think there\u2019s just a lot of confusion as to, hey, is Affordable Care Act in or out? Is time and attendance -- think about the time and attendance, we had a lot of selling of time and attendance solutions, with the rules then they got held up, and I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re ever going to go into effect and on the overtime rules. So, I think there is a lot of confusion now. Definitely, we\u2019re seeing, on the index, some employment increases, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s anything really strong yet that\u2019s really showing up completely in the number. Gary Bisbee : Great. Thanks. And then just one last one, if I could. On the margins, can you size the impact of the benefit of lower sales commissions or the lower variable selling expense? Efrain Rivera : Yes, year-to-date, Gary, I\u2019d say it\u2019s in the range of about 50 basis points. Gary Bisbee : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of James Berkley from Barclays. Your line is now open, sir. James Berkley : Thank you very much. Could you guys just update us -- and I think you talked about this a little bit already, but just update us on how you\u2019re thinking about your short-term versus long-term portfolio mix, the impact of the Fed rate increase on the yield curve that you\u2019ve seen? Just maybe speaking to that $8 million number and updating that that you talked about last year, I think that will be helpful to start. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Thanks. So, just sort of level setting what we anticipate. Every quarter point rise gives us about -- the way the portfolio is currently configured, about $3.5 million of benefit. We don\u2019t always see that, so we -- from a projection standpoint, it typically translates to about $3 million. The Fed rate rise that just occurred in March that would be expected to translate into about $2 million next year. But raises that have already occurred will add somewhere in the range of $6 million to $7 million. So, if I had to call it right now and there are no further rate rises, I\u2019d be probably somewhere in the range of $8 million to $9 million with the current raises the Fed has done. That\u2019s with no adjustment to the duration of the portfolio. So again, once again, as I said last quarter, I wouldn\u2019t take that to the bank as we\u2019re looking at how we configure the portfolio based on an environment where now it looks increasingly like there will be, at least this morning, a couple more rate rises by the end of the year. That increasingly seems to be the trajectory the Fed is on. So, we will take a look at that and then update on the guidance, but certainly that\u2019s trending in the right way for us. James Berkley : Thanks a lot. And then just two more quick follow-ups, if you don\u2019t mind, as you\u2019ve done in the past just on Advance Partners, just a breakout in terms of how that impacted you on the top line and then perhaps maybe expenses too. So, I think there were 22 days of Advance Partners in the quarter, correct me if I\u2019m wrong there. And then just last\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Yes -- sorry go ahead. James Berkley : And then, I was just going to say lastly, if you could just speak to the sustainability -- what drove that double-digit growth you saw in time and attendance, and then just the sustainability of that going forward, given some of the uncertainty around those rules? Thanks. Efrain Rivera : Yes. So, we netted the two, Advance -- and in my comments, Advance and the extra day, the combination of those two is about 1% year-to-date. So, Advance, and it\u2019s a little bit more than half of that -- I\u2019m sorry, Advance obviously contributed a little bit more than half of that 1% and then the extra day took out the rest. So, I hope that\u2019s reasonably clear. And then, I\u2019ll let Marty talk to the time and attendance. Martin Mucci : Yes. On the time and attendance, I think one, the overtime rules came out in the fall, the proposed overtime rules and are going to take effect December 1. And so, I think that drove a lot of clients to discuss with sales reps about solutions. At the same time, we added to our time and attendance portfolio what we call time and attendance essentials, Flex Time Essentials, which was a lower-end product that\u2019s more simple and easy for smaller businesses. So, we\u2019ve seen a real uptick. I think one, driven by the overtime rules that were supposed to go into effect. And then once clients got into that, I think they\u2019ve seen the need for tracking time better, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to go away. That seems to have a very strong stick. It\u2019s nicely integrated into our payroll platform. And again, as I said, we have multiple options of both Flex time and attendance and Flex time and attendance essentials as well as a number of different clocks that are now that are now available. So I think it\u2019s just a bigger increase in the need or the want for time tracking. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much. I just wanted to circle back on the discussion earlier about your small business index. But I know you\u2019ve been tracking this for a while. But then, I\u2019m just curious what the correlation is between changes in that index and changes in your business? How long it takes for you to see that and if you see that more on the payroll side or the HRS side? Thanks. Martin Mucci : Yes. I mean, the correlation obviously is usually pretty good. This is a sample; this index is done on 350,000 of our clients and under 50 employees. So again, this is focused on the under 50 side of the market. What that showed was that we\u2019ve continued to have small business, an improvement in small business job growth hiring over the last three months. We kind of peaked the last year around the April timeframe a year ago, April into May, and then that dropped off in the fall and then has come back and kind of recovered that. If you look at it on a full year-over-year basis, kind of March to March, we\u2019re about flat to last year\u2019s index. So, that\u2019s pretty much kind of what we\u2019re seeing, which is there\u2019s some job growth but it\u2019s fairly flat to last year as far as kind of employees per client type of thing. But it does indicate that it looks like it\u2019s on a nice upward trend and that the optimism that like on the NFIB index, that\u2019s off the charts is starting to flow into real job increases. But again, if you compare year-over-year, it\u2019s fairly flat because we kind of recovered from where the job growth dropped off in the fall. Jeff Silber : And I guess the pressure on the employees per client number, again, it\u2019s affecting more the payroll services line item as opposed to the HRS line item? Efrain Rivera : Yes, that\u2019s correct. And just to build on what Marty said. So, if you look at it on a same-store basis, we\u2019re flat to down in terms of employees per clients, especially in the under 50 space but really across the base because it\u2019s predominantly small market. So, we have yet to see in our client base, a significant uptick in client employees. We\u2019d like to see it but haven\u2019t seen it yet\u2026 Martin Mucci : \u2026which really ties to that index. Jeff Silber : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just a quick number\u2019s question for you, Efrain. On the tax rate for the fourth quarter, are there any discrete items that we should be aware of? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So, if you refer to the press release, Jeff, you\u2019ll see that we recorded, I believe, the amount -- look on the table, I believe it\u2019s $3.2 million that we recorded in the quarter for discrete tax items related to stock comp expense. So, I called out $0.05 for the year, but in the quarter, it added about a $0.01 to earnings. Jeff Silber : I\u2019m sorry. My question was for the fourth quarter, the current quarter. Efrain Rivera : Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Sorry about that, Jeff, automatic recording there. Jeff Silber : Yes, it\u2019s okay. Efrain Rivera : I don\u2019t know yet. One of the things that\u2019s interesting about that pronouncement is that it varies from quarter-to-quarter, depending on whether there are the amount and number -- the quantity and value of the shares exercised. So, at this point, I wouldn\u2019t anticipate any, but I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll have to see as we get into Q4, apologies for not answering initially. Jeff Silber : Don\u2019t worry about it. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Ridley-Lane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. David Ridley-Lane: Sure. The impact on the days to the payroll segment, the one fewer processing day, was about 100 basis points. Curious if you have sort of similar metric for the HR Services segment? Efrain Rivera : Yes, really pretty negligible, David. It really didn\u2019t have that much of an impact. It probably does have a little bit of an impact but not enough to call it out. David Ridley-Lane: And then, looking a little bit more closely at the HR Services, how much of the growth that you saw in retirement was related to those fee increases and perhaps market action versus signing up net new clients? Efrain Rivera : We had both in the quarter, but because market was up in the third quarter, we had a good bump. I can\u2019t quantify it anymore than that. Overall, it\u2019s not material to HRS results, but it was bigger than we had anticipated. David Ridley-Lane: And then from a revenue perspective, was third quarter the toughest Affordable Care Act related comparison? And would fourth quarter be pretty much like-for-like or ACA-related revenue is still ramping up in the fourth quarter of last year? Efrain Rivera : No, just the opposite. ACA is going to start to now slow down after Q3. So, although you\u2019re right that we had a significant compare in Q3, we were also carrying through because of the way revenues recognized in Q3, a chunk of that revenue gets recognized in the third quarter. And now we anniversary the uplift in ACA, and it starts -- the compares start to show slowing on the revenue, which is why I called out HRS being in the range that I mentioned. So that\u2019s really driven by PEO and Affordable Care Act. David Ridley-Lane: Got it. And then, did Affordable Care Act revenue grow or would you expect it to grow in the fourth quarter? Efrain Rivera : It will continue to grow in the fourth quarter and then decline; we\u2019ll see when we issue guidance. So, I think we\u2019ve hit the high watermark of growth in HR -- in Affordable Care Act revenue. We\u2019ll still have growth in fourth quarter and then we\u2019ll see as we go into next year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. James Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wandering could you maybe just talk a little bit about, given everything you said about the sales momentum or kind of a little bit about softness in sales right now? And then what you expect for PEO and other trends. How would you roll that up in terms of kind of puts and takes as we think about modeling fiscal 2018 and the impact of these impacts relative to the long-term growth target of the company laid out previously? Efrain Rivera : Yes. It\u2019s early but right now, in the absence of other factors, which again, I hesitate to quantify yet, we would see payroll service revenue trending the way we\u2019ve seen it this year. Don\u2019t anticipate that it will accelerate from where it is on that side. HRS will be impacted going into next year by the Affordable Care Act anniversarying that growth. So I\u2019d expect growth to be lower. And then on the interest rate side, I\u2019d expect that to be substantially up. We\u2019re going to have to sort of put that in the tumbler and see where it comes down in terms of guidance. But I would say that that\u2019s the thinking at this point. I\u2019d label it as preliminary. James Schneider : That\u2019s helpful. And then, maybe if you could kind of give some color relative to ACA comments you made before. What are your clients telling you about the market lead out if there\u2019s no changes to ACA and basically they kind of current attempt to modify or repeal it or kind of die, what would you expect in terms of new client decision making unfreezing or not? Martin Mucci : I think it would be much stronger. Obviously, I think we feel -- actually, the way things have turned out when you think about it from a Paychex impact, the Affordable Care Act kind of being delayed now and looks like it may take some time to get to change, and tax reform kind of being moved up first now to be worked on is very good for us. One, it gives us stability and retention of the revenue for ACA; and two, I think it will drive some more sales in ACA as well for even clients who were still kind of new clients of that size but also clients who were holding on or decided they want to change for somebody else now that kind of the thing has settled down. So, I think that\u2019s going to be good for us. I think the initial sales are kind of over like the clients or the majority of our clients who needed it, have it. But the good news is they\u2019ll keep it certainly longer. And now, the focus will be on tax reform, which tends to be very good for us, if it comes up the way we\u2019re hoping. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Rick Eskelsen : Just sort of building on your last comment there, Marty, specifically about the ACA module. I mean, I guess, you can define it more broadly, but how do you guys view that as competitively positioned? Do you think that, that module in and of itself is something where you have a differentiated solution that can drive takeaways or is really the value that you have it and you can provide it as part of your full sort of bundle and full stack solution? Martin Mucci : I think it certainly is very competitive. We were kind of the first out to the market with it. I think a lot of competitors have caught up to a certain degree, but I think we have a very good monitoring tool and have made -- from the first year, a year ago, have made a lot of improvements in the way we handled the filings themselves and the amount of work that the clients had to do. We saw a very large improvement in not only what the client experienced, but what operational efficiency of handling the filings and in filing the forms, getting them to the client employees and so forth. I think it\u2019s very competitive, if not more competitive, but it\u2019s certainly -- probably the biggest thing is, A, it is part of a bigger bundle of an integrated package that we can sell for those mid-market clients, actually anywhere probably kind of 40 employees to above. So, I think very competitive, and we\u2019ll continue to look to see if we can do more with it. But there\u2019s not a lot more development that\u2019s needed on that product. It\u2019s now about selling it and maybe hopefully taking share from some of the competitors as well. Rick Eskelsen : Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. Then just the second one for me, you talked about the small business indexes and hope of improved hiring. Have you seen, at least in conversation with clients or maybe for the solutions that they\u2019re looking for, a shift of focus from -- it seems like a lot of things were based on compliance, now your clients more thinking about growth and solutions that can help them to manage growth and manage potential increases in their hiring, sort of like a growth shift in their mentality? Martin Mucci : Yes. I do think to some degree there is. The big change we have seen over the last few years is that need for HCM for HR support to come down in size. And so, where you wouldn\u2019t sell that until clients were 30 or 40 employees, now you\u2019re seeing it even below 20 employees where they are looking for some support in recruiting, hiring, on-boarding their clients, bringing them into their business. I do think there is more positive environment where they look to buy solutions that are going to help them hire. We certainly get a lot more interest and really our go-to-market approach is much more now, A, what is your HR solution that you need, do you need help with recruiting, time and attendance, on-boarding your new employees, background checks and the whole hiring phase of it. We have a lot of interest in that. So, I do think that they are feeling a little bit more positive about the hiring going forward. Compliance always does play a very important role though. The biggest impact when you\u2019re trying to go over value with a client is being out of compliance with the number of changes that\u2019s going on right now. And while it may seem like federal regulations are going -- are decreasing or going to be decreasing, we are seeing a big ramp-up of state regulation, which are going to make it even more difficult for clients to comply, if they are multi-state employers. Rick Eskelsen : Thank you. Just the last one from me; first, a clarification. For the check for payroll, I believe you said it was negative last quarter and I think that in your comment, it was the same again this quarter. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Rick Eskelsen : And then for the pricing, last quarter, you again said you\u2019re sort of at the lower end of the 2% to 4% range. Can you give an update there? Efrain Rivera : Yes, same. Continuation of previous trend. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is now open. Mark Marcon : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Got several questions. First, I\u2019d like to start off with based on what you\u2019re currently seeing, what solutions area are you the most excited about selling do you think has the best prospects right now? Martin Mucci : Well, Mark, I think overall, it\u2019s the HR bundle, it\u2019s having the ability to go into our clients and help them, not from just the payroll side but from a complete from the fact of how do they recruit, staff their positions, onboard their employees, handle time and attendance right through the total HR outsourcing. I think what we really like now is we build this bundle, whether you\u2019re a small or mid-sized client that is fully integrated and allows you to have really kind of a seamless hire to retire, I guess, we\u2019d say, and at all levels of the Company, and you\u2019re on one platform. So, the fact that you can go from having 15 employees to adding labor distributions, to adding anything to feature functionality you want and grow to 50 or 60 and still be on the same platform without moving is we\u2019re very excited about. We see a lot of, as we mentioned, a lot of interest in time and attendance, so we\u2019ve had great solutions there, including the scale down essentials version for smaller clients. And so, we\u2019re very excited about all the products, really we have the offer and the level of technology and Software-as-a-Service and the service options that we offer now, 7x24 web chat, et cetera, all responding to kind of how quickly the market has changed. Mark Marcon : Great. And then with regards to that HR bundle as well as time and attendance, how much of the sales are basically going to the installed base or the efforts going to the installed base relative to trying to gather new clients? Martin Mucci : A lot of effort on -- the go-to-market strategy is really to offer those products right up front. The old model for us was payroll, and then go back and sell. And now, we\u2019ve trained the sales team at all levels to sell kind of the full solution right up front. So, we\u2019re seeing more sales on the front end but we still, obviously, with that large base of clients, we\u2019re going back and using a lot of more sophisticated data modeling to go back to clients who we think have a need now or that we missed upfront in selling those. So, I\u2019d say it\u2019s fairly balanced but we\u2019re doing a lot better on the front end of selling the complete package as opposed to because that\u2019s what the clients wants by the way now as opposed to, hey, let me sell you payroll and then come back in with other products later. Mark Marcon : Great. And then, if I could just go back to the mid-market comments, how they relate to some of those preliminary comments with regards to how to think about next year and to setting up the right expectations? And then finally, just on the PEO side. So, the question on the mid-market would basically be, was it a particular end of the mid-market? In other words, was it the low end of the mid-market where you\u2019re just getting up to fixed employees or was it more on the 200 to 300 or was it across the board? And is there any reason why that hesitation that\u2019s out there would change other than maybe we just have some resolution from a legislative perspective? Martin Mucci : I think it was kind of across-the-board, but I would say in the higher end. When you got up into the higher sizes, there seems to be a little more hesitation and less sales going on right there from compared to what we had expected and when you compare it to last year. And I think -- I do think when you have this administration and the amount of change we\u2019re going through, if they had already bought last year, they don\u2019t need to necessarily buy this year. They accelerated their buy. And this year, I think they\u2019re kind of waiting to seek. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had a time in our history where you\u2019ve seen kind of that much consternation in six months or so of overtime rules, happening, not happening? Got to have a solution, don\u2019t have to have a solution? ACA, have it, don\u2019t have to have it, now have to have it. So, I think there is -- does seem to be just kind of a very interesting kind of sluggishness about making a final decision in it. I would say it\u2019s not necessarily hanging right at the 50s. It\u2019s a little bit higher, might even be in that 100-plus type of thing. And sorry, and then a question\u2026 Mark Marcon : Yes, and just related to that, just when we think about core payroll and HRS, you talked about some initial thoughts for next year. I just want to make sure I interpreted it correctly. In terms of for next year, Efrain, you mentioned kind of on the payroll thing where we currently are. Do you mean where we are here in the second half of this fiscal year or where we are for the full year? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So, I think you can figure out what the underlying run rate is, excluding Advance. That puts us somewhere between 2% to 3%. That would be my initial thinking about where we go out next year, subject to a lot of further conversation. And then, you had a question on the PEO, Mark? Mark Marcon : Yes, I\u2019m sorry, just on HRS, just to be precise. What were you thinking preliminarily? Efrain Rivera : So, what I said was there\u2019s two headwinds we\u2019ll battle next year. One is you won\u2019t see the level of growth that we\u2019ve been seeing on the Affordable Care Act compliance product going into next year. That now anniversaries and starts to look a little bit more like a run rate business, depending on how much we sell or lose in a given year. So, you won\u2019t see that boost to growth. And then PEO is a wildcard. So, we saw less -- I forgot the last question. We saw less healthcare attachment but very lumpy, hard to predict, where. So, we saw some very large client attach healthcare and then we saw lots of smaller ones not attach healthcare. That we\u2019re going to have to just work through the rest of the year to figure out what our assumptions are there. Mark Marcon : And so does that mean like, okay, maybe 10 to 11ish? Efrain Rivera : It means we\u2019ll have to update in Q4, Mark. I can\u2019t call it yet, will be lower than this year. Mark Marcon : Great. And then I think you addressed the PEO, which is basically that you\u2019re basically seeing a little bit less healthcare attachment with some clients, but that\u2019s really more of a pass-through as opposed to affecting your true underlying economics? Efrain Rivera : That\u2019s correct. It will, but it does affect the revenue. So, I\u2019m attempting to be responsive as I normally am to fair questions, understanding that we haven\u2019t gone through, even a budget process yet. So, but I do think those are trends we are seeing in the business at the moment. Operator : Thank you. And our last question is coming from the line of the Ms. Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Lisa Ellis : Hi. Good morning, guys. When you look out over a multiyear timeframe, can you just talk about a bit how sort of you think about the investments you\u2019re making, either to grow your client base versus selling more ancillary services and add-on modules and gaining wallet share within your existing clients? Sort of how do you balance those? And then, depending on which one, what are some of the initiatives behind that, meaning additional modules you\u2019ve got coming down the pike or specific initiatives to reaccelerate client growth? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think it kind of -- the investment is spread by size and so forth. I think we\u2019re feeling good about the products that we have, frankly very competitive. And we\u2019re at stage where a lot of the investments we\u2019ve made over the last five years, and particularly the last couple of years, it really integrated the product set and at all levels to allow that kind of full, as much of the human capital management solution as you want, whether you\u2019re 10 employees or whether you\u2019re 200, and we feel good about those. I think what you\u2019ll see is a continuation of investment in user interface, in the interface and making it easier on the small and even easier to use the mobile apps. We\u2019re going mobile first in everything that we have and we\u2019re building and developing now. And so everything is going to be very easy from a mobile app. And you\u2019re seeing everything kind of be mobile first from us, and you\u2019re seeing a much larger adoption of our mobile app and the use of that, not only from clients but employees as well. And I think we\u2019ve talked about this before. Seeing a large use of the FI employees has turned out to be a good retention tool for us as well because they get used to what they like to get the pace up there, et cetera and the employers less likely to change. But I think the investments are also at the mid-market level where you\u2019re seeing more products set. I think we have pretty much a full-service solution there with everything that clients need but we\u2019ll always be looking to add more as we see a changing market dynamic and what they\u2019re looking for. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Anymore questions, operator? Operator : At this time, we have no further questions. Martin Mucci : All right. At this point, we\u2019ll close the call. If you\u2019re interested in replaying the webcast for this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 30 days. Thank you for the time to participate in this third quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point. Now I will turn the meeting over to your host, Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, you may begin. Martin Mucci : Thank you and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex fourth quarter fiscal 2017 earnings release. Joining me is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2017. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage and our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month. On today's call, I will update you on the results of our business in the fourth quarter and fiscal year and Efrain will review our financial results and discuss our fiscal 2018 guidance. After that, we will open it up for your questions. Fiscal 2017 ended with solid revenue and earnings growth and progress on our key initiatives. Over the past three years, our service revenues and operating income have experienced strong compound annual growth rate of approximately 8% finishing fiscal 2017 with over $3 billion in service revenue for the first time. We continue to enhance our position as a leading provider of human capital management or HCM solutions. Attachment of our various HCM service modules continues to grow driving 12% growth in our HRS revenues for fiscal 2017. Our comprehensive HR outsourcing solutions which are our ASO and PEO offerings have continued to experience strong demand in the marketplace with nearly 500 Paychex HR specialist providing service to over one million worksite employees, a milestone we reached in fiscal 2017. In addition, we have experienced strong demand for our time and attendance solutions among other offerings. As of May 31, 2017, we served approximately 605,000 total payroll clients, consistent with a year ago. Client growth was impacted by a challenging demand environment compared to last year and a modest decline in retention. Our business model is resilient and we believe we will resume client growth in fiscal 2018. The past few months have been a time of political uncertainty and we believe this has impacted outsourcing decision-making in the mid-market in particular. We are constantly evolving to enhance our competitive position and are focused on showcasing the value proposition of our full suite of HCM solutions. Last year in fiscal 2016, we had a particularly strong sales year across many divisions, driven in part by an increased demand for the outsourcing of HR and payroll solutions and our Affordable Care Act product in the mid-market as a result of the ACA requirements. This created tough comparisons for fiscal 2017 sales. Our fiscal 2017 mid-market payroll sales declined from the high level of activity experienced a year ago and this impacted the number and size of clients sold. Our client retention within our total payroll client base was approximately 81% and we have been engaged in a realignment of our service organization to allow greater flexibility and customization of our service the clients receive and we completed this effort in the fourth quarter of this past fiscal year. This project included the creation of our multi-product service centers, our 24x7 dedicated service centers as well and as part of this initiative, there has been a reallocation of client service specialists and clients among different service organizations. We believe this movement contributed to the modest decline in client retention this fiscal year, just off our near record high levels of the last year. We anticipate that retention will return to prior levels as this change is being completed and we transition back into the higher tenure. In addition, this was the first year in the past few years that we have seen a slight uptick in losses due to clients going out of business. Small business sentiment has remained positive, however the pace of employment growth seen in the first quarter of the calendar year has reversed in this past quarter. While the level of job growth has declined, there has been a steady increase in wages. A recent survey of our small business clients shows the changes that would most benefit their future success and growth are job creation, tax reform and healthcare reform. These are all priorities of the current administration's agenda and policy changes in these areas will likely lead to more HCM outsourcing demand. We have also seen an increase in the level of state regulations including specific minimum wage changes and over time rules even as the federal government has taken steps to reduce similar regulations. Many multi-state small and mid-size businesses should expect to experience an increased demand for outsourcing of their HR requirements given these changes and we are well positioned to support them through our technology and dedicated service. Throughout this last fiscal year, we have continued to offer new innovations to our technology platforms and value-added service offerings. A differentiator for us is our approach to user interface design. Our mobile-first design delivers the same client experience across any device, tablet, phone or desktop. It provides our clients immediate access to payroll, HR and reporting data from a single application. In addition to the technology innovation, we are continually making investments to respond to changes in client service needs, never losing that focus on delivering dedicated personalized service any way our clients want to receive it. In December, we were honored with the Brandon Hall Group bronze medal for the second year in a row. This award recognized Paychex Flex for the best advance in HR or workforce management technology for small and mid-sized businesses. In May, we, we were honored to earn two Stevie Awards. One was a silver award in the Company of the Year - Large category and we also received recognition for Customer Service Department of the Year. The Stevie Awards are presented annually by the American Business Awards and are considered to be top honors for sales and customer service. We recently also received Ethisphere's honor as one of the world's most ethical companies. This is the ninth time Paychex has been honored with this prestigious recognition and we appreciate the importance that our clients and employees place on this key value as a company. Paychex earned placement on Forbes' annual list of America's Best Employers on the list of large employers. This recognition is a result of Forbes polling employees on everything from company culture and trends to benefits and human resources. Paychex jumped up more than 50 spots from its 2016 ranking. And just yesterday, we announced that for the seventh consecutive year, we ranked as the largest 401(k) record keeper by total number of defined contribution plans, according to PLANSPONSOR magazine. In addition, we are in the ranking of largest record keeper by total plans with less than $10 million in assets. These honors are owed to the thousands of Paychex employees who deliver on our service premise each and every day. I would also like to note our PEO was one of the first to be certified to provide PEO services under the Small Business Efficiency Act. To be certified, we had to meet strict auditing and reporting standards. We have over 20 years in the PEO industry and achieving this certification reaffirms our position as a leading provider of PEO services in the U.S. We are proud of our market-leading positions and drive innovations in product and service to remain so. We continue to focus on being shareholder friendly company as well. For fiscal 2017, we returned over $800 million to our stockholders. Dividends paid were in excess of $660 million or 81% of our net income and we continue to repurchase our common stock opportunistically to offset dilution and utilized $166 million for that purpose last year. The strong cash generation in our business model allows us to reward our shareholders with a high dividend yield without constraining our ability to invest in our business. In summary, our fourth quarter closed out another successful year for the company. In these uncertain times for our clients in terms of HR and regulatory requirements and their need to efficiently grow their businesses to recruiting, engaging and supporting their employees, we are poised as an essential partner for their success. We believe we have sustainable growth within our market ecosystem with the combination of our state-of-the-art technology, full suite of HCM product offerings and the world-class service that meets clients' needs as they grow. I appreciate the great work and efforts of our Paychex employees and management team and I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera who will review our financial results in more detail. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks Marty and good morning to everyone. I would like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, refer to the customary disclosures. Fourth quarter financial results for fiscal 2017 marked continued progress. I am going to touch on some of the key highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. I will provide greater detail in certain areas and then I am going to wrap up with a review of the outlook for the upcoming fiscal year in 2018. Total service revenue, as you saw, grew 6% for the fourth quarter to $785 million and 7% for the fiscal year to $3.1 billion. Interest on funds held for clients increased 14% for the fourth quarter to $14 million and 10% for the fiscal year to $51 million. These increases were primarily driven by slightly higher average interest rates earned. Expenses increased 5% for the fourth quarter and 6% for the fiscal year. Expense growth in both periods was impacted by higher wages and related expenses due to growth in headcount primarily in our operations areas. Expense growth was moderated by lower variable selling costs. Our operating margin was 37.4% for the fourth quarter, an 80 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. For fiscal 2017, our operating margin was 39.3%, a year-over-year improvement of 50 basis points. We continue to maintain industry leading margins while investing in our operations and in technology. Our effective income tax was 35% for the fourth quarter compared to 35.5% in the prior year. For both the full year 2017 and 2016, the effective tax rate was 34.3%. The effective income tax rates for both fiscal 2017 and 2016 were impacted by discrete items recognized. In fiscal 2017, discrete tax benefits recognized included the impact of adoption of new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based compensation payments. This new guidance has resulted in discrete tax benefits recognized upon exercise or lapse of stock-based awards. In fiscal 2016, we recognized a net tax benefit on income from prior tax years related to customer facing software that we provide. Net income increased 10% to $195 million for the fourth quarter and 8% to $817 million for the fiscal year. Diluted earnings per share also increased 10% to $0.54 per share for the fourth quarter and 8% to $2.25 per share for the year. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income increased 9% for both the fourth quarter and fiscal year to $194 million and $779 million respectively. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 10% to $0.54 for the quarter and grew 8% to $2.20 for the year. Note that these two non-GAAP measures exclude the certain discrete tax items that we previously discussed. Please refer to our press release for a discussion of the non-GAAP measures and reconciliation to the related measures under GAAP. So basically what we are doing and as we talk going forward here, we are going to exclude the benefit of those tax benefits when we talk about adjusted net income. So if you look at the slides that are on our investor page, you will see on page 16 a very clear and detailed example of what we are talking about. So if any confusion, just look there. Payroll revenue increased 2% for the fourth quarter to $441 million and 3% to $1.8 billion for fiscal 2017. The growth in payroll revenue is largely due to better revenue per client as a result of price increases, net of discounting. Year-to-date payroll cable service revenue growth of 3% included approximately a little bit less than 1% from the impact of the Advance Partners. Similar to the emphasis I made last quarter, with the evolving nature of our business to an HCM service provider, our offerings of bundle product products to our customers have increased. Revenue from those bundles is allocated in a portion between payroll and HRS. Payroll growth remains steady in the low single digits and HRS revenue growth reflects the sale of more services declines and greater revenue per client. Average client size, as we have discussed previously, have been trending down slightly this year and this had an impact on revenue growth during the year. HRS revenue increased 10% to $344 million for the fourth quarter and 12% to $1.3 billion for the fiscal year. It was actually 44% of service revenue in the fourth quarter and it shows that within a short period of time we will be about half-and-half, payroll and HRS. The increase in HRS reflected continued growth in the client base across all major HCM services including comprehensive HR outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance and HR administration. Retirement services also reflected an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of participants' funds. Insurance services benefited from continued growth in revenue from our ACA compliance service as well as growth in the number of health and benefit applicants along with higher average premiums and an increase in our workers' comp product. For the fiscal year, the impact of the Advance Partners was also approximately 1% of the growth of HRS revenue. Turning to our investment portfolio, our goal is the same as it's always been, protect principle and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, primarily short-term investment vehicles are bank demand deposit accounts, variable rate demand notes. In the longer term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government securities. Our long-term portfolio has a current average yield of 1.7% and an average duration of 3.2 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.3% for the fourth quarter and 1.2% for the fiscal year, up form 1.1% in the respective prior year periods. During fiscal 2017, the Fed increased the federal funds rate twice, 25 basis points in December and 25 basis points in March, 2017. We have seen a modest impact from these rate increases on our fiscal 2017 results, but anticipate a greater impact in the upcoming year. The Fed again increased the market interest rate by another 25 basis points earlier this month. The impact to net earnings of a 25 basis point increase in short-term rates is estimated to be in the range of $3 million to $4 million after taxes for the next 12-month period. It's incorporated in the guidance. We don't make any assumptions in the guidance at this stage as to future Fed rate increases, although we believe that there will be some. Average investment balances for funds held for clients were down modestly in the fourth quarter and about 1% for the year. I will walk you through highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $777 million as of May 2017. During the fourth quarter, we ended the year with no debt. We paid down a small amount of debt that we have outstanding during the year. Funds held for clients were $4.3 billion compared to $4 billion as of May 31, 2016. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and average $4.3 billion for the fourth quarter and $4.1 billion for the fiscal year. Our total available for sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $32 million as of the end of the year, compared with an unrealized gain of $40 million as of May 31, 2016. Total stockholders' equity was $2 billion as of the end of the year, reflecting $662 million in dividends and as Marty mentioned, $166 million of repurchases of Paychex common stock. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was not only sterling but a very sterling 42%. Our cash flows from operations were $960 million for the fiscal year, a modest decrease from prior year. This was the result of fluctuations in working capital offset by higher net income and non-cash adjustments contributing to the working capital growth where growth in accounts receivable balances as of the end of the year from our Paychex Advance business and we had a very large client that we brought onboard testament to their success and winning business in that part of the market and that impacted balances as of the end of the year. We will see the benefits of the client as we go through next year. We remind you, talking about guidance, that this outlook is based on our current view of economic and interest rate conditions continue with no significant changes. Our guidance for the full fiscal year is as follows. Payroll service revenue anticipated to be in the range of 1% to 2%. HRS revenue growth anticipated in the range of 8% to 10%. Interest on funds held for clients anticipated to grow in the mid to upper teens. So that means 15% to 20% reflecting the benefit of recent increases in short-term rates. Total revenue including interest on funds held for clients is anticipated to grow approximately 5%. Operating income expressed as a percentage of total revenue, anticipated to be approximately 40%. Investment income net is anticipated to be in the range of $9 million to $11 million. Our effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 35.5% to 36%. Adjusted net income is expected to increase approximately 7%. Adjusted net income excludes the impact of the discrete tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2017 relating to employee stock-based comp payments. We made no assumptions as to future benefits to be recognized in our fiscal 2018 projections due to the uncertainty of measurement involved. Please refer to our non-GAAP financial measures disclosure in our press release and our investor presentation page 16 for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to GAAP basis net income for fiscal 2017 as well as further discussion regarding our use of this measure. GAAP basis net income is anticipated to grow approximately 5%. GAAP includes the impact of $18.3 million in discrete tax benefits recognized this year related again to that same issue, employee stock-based comp payments. Adjusted diluted earnings per share. So now we turn to EPS, again, non-GAAP, is anticipated to grow in the range of 7% to 8%. This measure, again excludes the impact of the tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2017 related to employee stock-based comp payments. As previously mentioned, you can find it in the press release and you can find it in the investor presentation. Now what many of you are waiting to hear, further detail on the annual guidance. So I will provide this detail on the gating for fiscal 2018. First, growth in payroll services revenue is anticipated to be within the full-year range for the first half of the year and toward the high end of the range for the second half of the year. So I am going to repeat that again, growth in payroll service revenue anticipated be within the full-year range for the first half of the year and toward the high-end of the range in the second half of the year. Growth in HRS revenue is anticipated to be within or above the full-year range for each quarter with one exception, which is the first quarter, which will fall below the low end of the range, of the ranges we anticipate at this point that it's going to fall below that range. Total revenue growth as a consequence, in the first quarter will fall below the full-year guidance range, modestly below but below. Growth in net income on a GAAP basis is anticipated to be essentially flat for the first quarter. In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, that's when we recognized a large tax benefit from the adoption of new accounting guidance related to employee stock-based comp payments. As previously noted, our guidance for fiscal 2018 does not include any assumptions around this benefit, but we anticipate we may realize a modest benefit during the year. So to just reiterate there, on first quarter we anticipate at this point that it will be flat with prior year on a GAAP basis. If you look at what we did in Q1, you will understand what's going on there. So that concludes my discussion. And I will turn it back over to Marty. Martin Mucci : Great. Thanks Efrain. Operator, we will now open up the call to any questions please. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Mr. David Togut from Evercore. Sir, your line is now open. Rayna Kumar : Good morning. It's Rayna Kumar for David. Martin Mucci : Hi Rayna. Rayna Kumar : Can you please call out what the 4Q 2017 bookings growth was? And if you can just discuss your expectations for FY 2018 bookings? Martin Mucci : Yes. This is Marty. So we don't talk so much about the exact growth. I think what we saw was overall PAR sold was down from last year. It was more on a normalized basis if you look at the year before and the couple of years before. We were more on that level. Last year we peaked, in fiscal 2016 we peaked. I think with ACA we saw a lot of, not only the ACA product sales, but we saw a number of opportunities for payroll and time and attendance and other products, people made decisions because of ACA to outsource and so we had a bump up. And then this last year, fiscal 2017 we had a lower overall PAR sale than that level, but more on a normalized basis. And when we look at this year, we certainly expect the growth to be back up. We don't really talk about exactly where we are on that, but we feel good about the changes in go-to-market strategy that we are making, some things we are adjusting to. We are increasing the spend in digital marketing because we are seeing a larger number of leads coming in, obviously on the web and we feel good about the marketing that we are doing and we are increasing that investment. And we are also increasing the number of virtual sales reps because the leads that are coming in, we need to sell even faster and clients are looking to sell them over the phone through chat, et cetera and we have positioned ourselves to be able to do that frankly and already set up that positioning in the fourth quarter. So down a bit from last year, however we feel good about going into this year. The growth in PAR sales that will bounce back. Efrain Rivera : Hi Rayna. Our acronym internally for bookings, it's PAR, Paychex annualized revenue, if anyone is sort of wondering what PAR is. Rayna Kumar : That's very helpful. And just lastly, could you discuss the pricing trends you saw in the fourth quarter for both payroll and HR services? And how we should think about pricing for FY 2018? Martin Mucci : Yes. I don't think we saw any big change. I do think overall pricing competition picked up a little bit in the year, not so much in the quarter but in the year. And so we didn't feel like competition change all that much from a technology and product offering, we feel very good about that. I think pricing got a little more aggressive during the year probably because everyone faced the same issue, which was kind of a decrease in opportunities as a result of ACA the previous year. Now fewer people were outsourcing. There were fewer opportunities. Everyone got a little bit more aggressive on price. Nothing significant. And we still feel that as you look at that fiscal 2018, this new fiscal year, we should still be able to have a price increase in our normal range and we didn't have any major drop-off because of that. Rayna Kumar : Great. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from the line of Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open. Danyal Hussain : Hi. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I just wanted to ask, maybe first on retention. You called out that you have worked on the service initiative in part to address this. I just want to know if there's been any change so far and what have you observed, I guess at the end of the fourth quarter and so far has there been any improvement? Martin Mucci : Yes. In the fourth quarter, what we saw was a trend of bringing tenure back up. What basically happened is and we knew there would be some client disruption because of this, over the last 18, even 24 months, we have been moving and I talked about this a little bit, we have been shifting to different client service segments. So while we have sold a lot more of our HR administration online, our time and attendance offerings, et cetera. We started moving clients to multi-product centers where we have teams of people where you just don't have payroll, but you have payroll and time and attendance and HR expertise in a team setting that is still dedicated to the client, but now you have that full team setting. We also saw an increase in number of online clients, clients doing payroll themselves over the last few years and we shifted them to what we call a dedicated service center because they are more inbound calls, then they are our normal service model of calling out to the client at a specified time. We had more inbound kind of as the client needed the service. So we shifted them to dedicated service centers where we are open 7x24 and we have much better technology, enhanced technology that we put in place that we invested in as well as chat, et cetera, our web chat, et cetera. So we finished that in the fourth quarter. All of that move, that disrupted some clients, meaning that a dedicated payroll specialist that I had prior, I may have lost because I moved more tenured people into multi-product centers or other areas. We then, during the course of the year, hired a number of new client service specialist who had less experience and that caused some disruption in the clients and in the level of service. And so our near record high client retention of 82% fell to about 81%. We expect that to come back. What we have seen in the fourth quarter already, client satisfaction numbers coming back up, client service specialist tenure, so then the experience, the certification, the months of experience are coming back up as well. We are back even above where we were at the beginning of the fiscal year. So we think now we are obviously coming out of that and expect to get ourselves back up near record highs by the end of the year. Efrain Rivera : Just to add to that, the fact that retention went down was not a complete surprise to us. We had planned it to be down about 50 basis points. Obviously, it was higher than we anticipated by the time the year concluded. Danyal Hussain : Okay. Thank you. And then just a clarification on sales bookings. Marty, you said that you feel good about growth for the year. Has there been any change in underlying client behavior? Or is this more a function of just easier comps and the fact that you are investing in maybe some of these higher growth digital channels? Martin Mucci : No. Well, I think it's a combination of both. I do think there was some customer behavior that changed last year which, as I described, was that the year before, in fiscal 2016 with ACA coming on very heavy in the requirements, we saw a number of new opportunities and I don't think at the time we realized as much that they were a big jump in the number of opportunities that were out there, where people said, hey, it's time for me to outsource everything, payroll, HR, et cetera. Then in this last fiscal year 2017, those number of opportunities were decreased. There wasn't as much of a push on that. So there was a little bit of a macro change there. I do think that, as I mentioned in my comments, what we are seeing is the level of regulations, while they may be reducing on the federal level with the current administration, state regulations are increasing. Minimum wage specific to cities and states are changing. Over time rules are being put in place in states as opposed to federal. Everything is getting more complicated and we think this will produce even more opportunities. And then internally, the changes we are making with the virtual sales increase and the additional investment in marketing spend, we really think is going to drive the growth back up to where we would like to see it. Danyal Hussain : Thank you. And maybe just a clarification on the earlier point on pricing. Was that elevated pricing competition up in the mid-market or throughout? Martin Mucci : Mostly in the mid-market. We actually felt pretty good about the small-market this year, when you look at the total clients. And so it was a little bit more, I mean there was more competition, I think, in all markets, but I think the mid-market was a little more aggressive and I think that was folks coming, I think that was competitors also coming off of the higher year with HCA. Danyal Hussain : Sure. Thank you very much. Martin Mucci : Thank you Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open Martin Mucci : Hi Jim. Jim Schneider : Hello. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe just give an update and touch on the federal regulatory environment? Clearly we have had inaction on ACA Repeal-and-Replace for some time now. What are your clients in the mid-market telling you about or what's their behavior telling you about their intention to kind of put on new bookings or generate new sales in the face of that? Or we are going to have to wait until that is kind of fully resolved and baked before that part of the market gets unstuck? Are you seeing some parts of the market get unstuck now? And I guess just kind of broadly speaking, do you still see that as a headwind incorporated in your fiscal 2018 guidance? Martin Mucci : I think there's a couple of points I would make. One is, the good news is the retention of the ACA product with our clients is very good. So even though there's all this talk about repealing the Affordable Care Act and the mandatory requirement, we are not seeing much drop-off in the number of clients in the Affordable Care Act. I think what we are seeing in the behavior is, hey, I am still going to have to do something. I may not have a mandatory requirement to hold insurance but I need to report something and I am going to stick with the product. In addition to that, what we are also seeing the behavior is, hey once I put insurance as a benefit offering to my employees, I can't just say I am not going to offer it anymore because it's not required. It's been used to recruit and keep, retain employees of our clients and I don't think you are going to see a big drop-off of those that are necessarily providing insurance now just because the mandate is not there. I do think though, as I mentioned that we are seeing in our jobs index that's more small businesses under 50, that there has been a drop-off of the employment growth rate. And so they are not hiring as many and I do think there is probably some of that macro out there where, hey I am a little confused as to what's going to happen on tax reform, what's going to happen with the Affordable Care Act and those kind of things. Jim Schneider : That's helpful. Thanks. And maybe just as a follow-up, on the HR growth, clearly the 8% to 10% growth you are calling out below this fiscal 2017 level, but I think you are indicating that that's largely due to difficult comps and ACA. So I guess maybe it's still a deceleration over the trends you have seen in the past couple of years. So how much of that is cyclical? And then as we head into the back half of fiscal 2018, what's your visibility on that growth rate kind of improving? And I guess to the point you made earlier about increasing state regulations, what opportunity do you still see remaining on HRS from a state level? And over how many states is that? Efrain Rivera : Hi Jim. I will take the first part of that question. So the answer is, the 8% to 10% range versus double digit really has a lot to do, as you said, with the fact that our assumption is that Affordable Care Act revenue and modules are likely to be flat to down slightly with this year, given the amount of uncertainty going on and the fact that we anticipate sort of the normal amount of attrition that we see with those clients, we have not been aggressive in our assumption around what happens with ACA. And obviously we had a nice benefit from that over the last couple years. So I would say that's part A. Part B, remember that we had about little bit over 1% contribution from Advance Partners. They are doing very well, but we obviously don't have that going into next year. So if you stripped out those factors, we are growing double digit in HRS. And I think you are absolutely right. I called out in the first quarter that HRS is below the range of total guidance for the year for revenues, just because of the comp primarily with the Affordable Care Act. As you get through first quarter, the comps get easier and then we resume more normalized patterns of growth. So in the second half, HRS growth is certainly stronger than the first half. That's at least at this point what we anticipate. Now with respect to state regulations and all that, I will just turn that over to Marty to talk. Martin Mucci : Yes. I think from a state perspective, we are probably seeing almost half the states look for ways to put in their own regulations to make up for the federal reductions. So they are looking for minimum wage increases. They are looking to put in new overtime rules for the state. They are looking for all kinds of things and I don't think that will even, now you are even hearing about, depending on what happens with Affordable Care Act, various taxes, new taxes, payroll taxes, possibly to make up for some of the reduction and what the feds are subsidizing at the state level. The other thing on the HRS revenues, every product, every client base or proper set we have all increased in this fiscal year. So we continue to feel really good about 401(k). We are still the leading provider of the most plans of anybody. We have over a million worksite employees, more than anyone on our HR outsourcing. And we were one of the first to be, as I mentioned, on the PEO certification. So we feel very good about HR outsourcing in particular coming back pretty strong. So once we get past some of the comparables that Efrain mentioned, I think we continue to feel really good about HR outsourcing, PEO and ASO. Jim Schneider : That's helpful. Thanks. you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from the line of James Berkley from Barclays. Your line is now open. James Berkley : Good morning guys. Thanks for the time. Marty, if you just could provide some more color on the mid-market versus down-market? You called out the mid-market as a challenging area last quarter, obviously. Just getting a lot of questions from investors around how much of the challenging environment, particularly in that mid-market, is uncertainty related and ACA driven versus competition related, if at all? Just especially given strong growth rates you have seen from some smaller players that focus on that space, Paylocity, for example. Those other guys offer ACA solutions as well. Maybe part of that disconnect has to do with the fact that the smaller players have less robust ACA offerings and easier comps? I am just trying to get a better feel for what's going on there. Martin Mucci : Yes. I think that certainly can be part of it, but I think we feel good. We do feel good about the technology and the offering that we have as well as the service. I think we have talked about that some of the mid-market, we are working through a migration from an old platform. Now 96% of our Flex clients are on Flex. So it's not like it's a large number that we still have to work through. But I think all of that has had some impact on mid-market. I think we feel very good about, from a technology. Pricing, a little bit tougher. Again, I think people, all of us, all competitors were challenged a little bit coming off the ACA year and so pricing down a little bit more aggressive, but we feel very good about the offerings that are out there. We are very competitive and we are not really necessarily losing that much more to anybody in particular. I think it was just a tougher compare year. Macro-wise, I think there is, as I mentioned, some impact of for those larger clients over 50 employees, okay, what is exactly the impact on a B2B from all of the administration and they are probably a little bit slower. James Berkley : Okay. Thanks. And then just could you talk a little more about the large client you alluded to? How large? What impact you see it having to growth next year? What drove the client decision to us Paychex? Efrain Rivera : That was specifically related to the advance funding portion of the business. So if you notice there was a bump in receivables. The way that business works is, if you find a large client, you get the receivable impact upfront and then you start realizing the benefit as you collect fee. So I was just calling out specifically what was happening with Advance Partners. And by the way, that business grew strongly and has been a tremendous contributor during the year and we think going forward it's very bullish on what's going on there. James Berkley : Thanks for that clarification. Last one here, just to build out Jim's prior question around HR revenue just being a little slower than we have seen in the past. Could you break out what's going on there and touch on how confident you are in top line guidance with margin expansion is a lot higher in the guidance there than we typically see? So just kind of like what's going with few things? And then you may have previously set the bar low, it seems, just because last year you had probably tried to avoid lowering guidance like you saw last year. It looks like maybe you set the bar low. Efrain Rivera : Great question. I would say, if you look at us over the last six years, we have never missed earnings. So I would say that we have generally beaten on the upside. So there is always an element of conservatism in our guidance and I hope that that continues into next year. But though what's going on is that we have a grow-over comparison. And by the way, we are the first to report and I am certain that others will say exactly the same thing. There is a grow-over comparison on ACA modules that everyone's going to face. For us, the impact is more significant in the first quarter and it abates as we go through the year. And the second part, as I mentioned, Advance Partners was a contributor to revenue for the year and HRS a little bit over 1%. But most of that benefit occurred in the first half of the year because we acquired them in the second half of 2016. So basically that's what's going on there. On the margin guidance, just remember that when I said margin guidance, sometimes I talk in the past talk about operating margin excluding float, it's up and then operating margin in general, it's up, of course because now we are getting the benefit of investment income. But we are very proud of operating at 40% margins. That always is a number that we think we want to beat. So last year, if you remember what the guidance was, we have said it appeared to be flat, I got a lot of questions and I said, even in a year where we were investing in operations, for the reasons that Marty mentioned before, pivoting to a much more dedicated service options for clients and we still, despite those investments delivered 50 basis points. Part of that was lower variable selling costs. So we feel very comfortable on the expense guidance because we have specific plans against that. And our job is to figure out how we can do even better than what we put out there in terms of our guidance. So that's a little bit of color on what our thought process was. James Berkley : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Sir, your line is now open. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Hi. How are you guys. Good morning. Martin Mucci : I read your policy questions, by the way. I read then all. We talked about them, just so you know, okay. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Yes. Thank you. I wanted to sort of go back to this notion of payroll and HRS becoming equal sized. There are a couple of things, I think, going on there. One is sort of from a headline perspective, the takeaway can be that there is a slowdown coming a little bit more permanent in nature for HRS, but then you also look at the penetration metrics that you guys have provided and you guys are what, 15%, 20% penetrated with regards to your payroll base. So I guess the question becomes, with that level of penetration, why isn't the pace of growth and rate of penetration higher? Is there something you can be doing there t make it higher? Is that opportunity real, in other words? Martin Mucci : There is definitely opportunity for improvement and we feel it's a great opportunity. I think one of the things that's probably challenged us in the past is the size of the client. So when the clients are smaller, obviously they don't need as many of the HR outsourcing type products. However two things. One from a macro environment, we are seeing more and more of those regulations and those needs come down in size. So a client a few years ago that was 15 employees didn't need HR outsourcing, but today due the complexity in the requirements and compliance, they do. So we think there is a growing need for the HR outsourcing at smaller levels of a client which is good for us. I think we have gotten better and better at providing a full-service sales opportunity right upfront. One of the things you are seeing in our go-to-market strategy for sales is to offer the clients the full value of our products in the first conversation with them as a prospect, which in the past we sold payroll and then we came back later and sold them other products. And I think we are seeing that the clients are needing more things up first and frankly we weren't servicing the full value of what they were looking for. And that change we have made and we think that that will drive that that as well. And I also think that you are seeing as more clients are taking a bundled product, it's becoming more difficult to separate payroll and HRS as a revenue source because these products are bundled and we are doing some allocations now. But it's going to get more and more difficult to do that. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. And then the lower permanent hiring growth that you alluded to, should that translate to higher temp hiring growth that helps Advance Partners? And is there further M&A opportunity then in that direction? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think, as Efrain said, Advance Partners had a great year, better than we expected and great leadership there in the team and they have done very well and I think that the temp environment is definitely picking up. We have even seen in our own numbers that clients with less than 50 employees, the part-time workforce by itself has gone up to become more than 10% of the workforce from about 6% just a few years ago, three or four years ago. So you are definitely seeing more businesses take part-time and temps and we are continuing to look at rollup strategy as part of getting a great company like Advance was that there are number of these funding companies out there that are small and that could benefit by a rollup strategy and the technology and innovation that advances those. So we definitely think there is more opportunity there and definitely think there will be more temp and gig economy type part-time employment where people are working multiple places part time instead of full time. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. One last clarification question. The investment income outlook was a touch higher than what we were looking for. And I just wanted to clarify, is there a breakage assumed in there where you are taking gains? Or is it fairly straightforward? Efrain Rivera : No. We wouldn't give guidance assuming a breakage. I think if you are looking at year-over-year, Ashwin, there are a number of items that run through that. So this year we wrote off a small investment, several small investments that we had made or wrote down the value of those investments. So this year was a little bit artificially depressed and next year we are not assuming we are going to do that. Very modest immaterial number. So no, there is no gains. That what's going on. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Okay. Got it. Thank you guys. Martin Mucci : Okay. Thanks Ashwin. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now open. Martin Mucci : Hi Gary. Gary Bisbee : Hi guys. Good morning. I think I ask you this every year in the fourth quarter. So I will keep the trend going. Can you give us an update of just penetration within the payroll client base of some of the key HRS offerings? And how do you think about the opportunity remaining, the ceiling? Where you are getting closer to that? Just any color to help us think about the long-term potential of HRS. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Yes. Gary, I don't think we are getting near any ceilings. I think we have lots of opportunity and in fact, as I mentioned on the last question, I think the opportunity is growing because the needs are coming down in size. So I think the opportunity is very strong there. I think the fact that a 10 or 15 company may need more support on HR and that we have tailored our products and the service teams to support that bodes very well for us. I think the most penetrated would obviously be workers' comp. 401(k) is pretty strong as well. And HR outsourcing. All of these leave a lot of opportunity, insurance being the smallest penetration and the newest that we have offered, meaning H&B, health and benefit insurance. So lots of opportunity there. We don't disclose it exactly, but there is a lot of opportunity there for us. And in fact, I think the opportunity is increasing, particularly for HR support. Gary Bisbee : Okay. Great. And then you talked about the internal stuff impacting the retention. Was there any change in competitive intensity in terms of the number of losses on where the losses were going? Or was it, you mentioned some increase in out of business and then your service changes, is that it? Or was there also, you know -- ? Martin Mucci : A little bit on competition, but I think that the vast majority frankly was kind of self-driven, unfortunately that we knew, as Efrain said, we projected some because we knew that we would have to disrupt some clients and their payroll specialist or their client service specialist that's dedicated to them. The good news is, that provides us great retention. The bad news is, when we have to change it on a client and move them around a little bit, at first that causes disruption and there was a lot of newer people brought into the mix. We didn't shutdown an area necessarily and close a business or close a location and move it, but we did move a lot of people around and are doing that kind of still across the country, but we are doing it virtually in a lot of places. So we moved a lot of experienced people into multi-product centers to handle other kinds of businesses and that disrupted the clients. So I would say, we really feel based on all of the stats we have, most of the change in retention from our near high best to down about a percentage point was really caused by the service disruption, the changes we made and now we are past that and we already see it starting to bounce back at the end the Q4. So we are feeling good that we will get back there through this next year. Gary Bisbee : Okay. Great. And then just on the client funds balances, can you give a little more color on why that's been moving slightly lower over the past year or so? And what's the outlook within the guidance you have provided for the trend in that? Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Yes. So let me start. I mentioned this a couple of times. So I think the first thing is, we made a change in terms of the timing on when we remit payments to taxing authorities in certain states. I won't bore you with the details, but suffice it to say that brought balances down a bit and that's been a headwind through the year. We think that that starts to abate next year. Client mix has had some impact. Our client mix is skewed smaller during the year, so slightly smaller. It depends on what assumptions you make about wage growth but we expect we will be flat to up slightly going in the next year as opposed to being down slightly this year. So those are the things impacting balances. Gary Bisbee : Great. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : You are welcome. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Martin Mucci : Hi Brian. Bryan Keane : Hi guys. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Just wanted to ask on client growth. It was flat and I guess you usually that's up a couple points. I think it was up 2% last year. I know attrition played a role here. But just thinking about other factors that maybe caused that to be more flattish this year. And then when you think about a potential rebound for fiscal year 2018, what might cause that? Martin Mucci : I think as we have talked about, Bryan, I think most of the impact of that has been the increase in losses. So the drop in retention rate was probably a bigger piece of that. And I think, as I have talked about, I think all of the changes now being done in the fourth quarter from moving clients around into better service segments and service models, I think we are going to see that bounce back, because I think everything's in place where we are seeing the tenure of our specialist move up. I also think that being now in the right place, the reason we did it was to drive client retention even higher which was, hey, when you are an online client and you are mostly calling in, we needed better technology tools that are web chat, et cetera to handle the client the way they wanted to be serviced and all of that now is in place. And so we feel that we are really well positioned in multi-product centers before where if you had payroll and time and attendance, we had a specific team on time and attendance that we move you to, we now combined those teams. So we have the best expertise and a combined team to handle multi-product clients. We think that is going to help, particularly in the mid market where we have sold multiple products and we have increased, of course, that penetration. So we really feel like that will bring us back into that kind of growth rate. Bryan Keane : Okay. What about changes in new business starts? It sounded like also you maybe mentioned that bankruptcies picked up a little bit here as well. Martin Mucci : Yes, we did. We saw, that was a little surprising to us because given all the things you are seeing in the economy, we are little surprised, but we have seen a few more losses as a result of that. Don't really know why. We have seen new business starts. We are not expecting a big change in that. They have kind of come back up to where they were pre-recession and they have held there. And so I think that will work in our favor. And there was something else you mentioned that I was going to say. But I guess the other thing I was going to say is, our go-to-market strategy that I mentioned earlier on sales I think will also drive more sales, particularly on the low-end for these new business start-ups. What we are seeing is, more clients coming to us from the web as opposed to from a call and client referral, that type of thing. They are coming in. They are searching, as you would expect. They are going on the web and they are contacting our team that way. We would then give that to a rep in the field, even if they were a small one, two, three employee client startup. And what we are finding today is, many clients don't want to wait two days to have a rep come and visit them. They are ready to buy on the phone. So we have increased our digital spend pretty significantly and we have increased our virtual sales reps who are selling 7 days a week and almost 24 hours. They are ready to handle the sale right over the phone and the client is ready to buy that way. So we think that's going to really help us. All that's set up and already running. Bryan Keane : Okay. And then last question for me. Efrain, you talked about the seasonality for fiscal year 2018 as I understand in HRS and payroll services, I think it's kind of in the range and then it goes to the high-end during the back half. Is that seasonality as well? And I know last year we talked about some difference in processing days. So is that not a factor this year? Thanks so much. Efrain Rivera : No. I mercifully do not have to talk about days in 2018. So that has no impact, Bryan. No, I think that the way, if you look at where our growth was last year, the compares in the first half are a little tougher and then they ease in the back half on the assumption that the way that we think the sales year unfolds that way. So that's basically what's going on. Bryan Keane : And does that make 2% a more normalized growth rate then going forward, as we think about the model? Efrain Rivera : I think, Bryan, I would withhold that until we go through the year. I would anticipate, I think that implicit in that guidance is that we are still assuming a little bit of client mix occurring during the year. So I would say, just given the amount of change that's happened already, I would think that coming out of 2018 we should see a little bit higher growth than 2%. But let's get to Q4 and we will have another conversation. Bryan Keane : Okay. Helpful. Thanks so much guys. Operator : Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair. Sir, your line is now open. Tim McHugh : Hi. Just one question. I guess maybe I don't know if it was just my impression, but I think the prior call or two, you had obviously about this weakness in the mid-market that you have been seeing. This call, I don't know, if it's just because of the year-end, but it seems to be a little bit more talk of small business market in terms of retention and kind of choppiness in that market? Did it change late in the year on the small business market? Or is it just talking about full-year? I guess I am trying to understand if you saw some incremental weakness and whether it's retention or new sales more in the small business side of the spectrum late in the fiscal year? Martin Mucci : Yes. I would say the impact of the small business actually was, we felt pretty good from, I think overall when you look at small business, the sales were pretty good, nothing major change there. The retention is where we took some of the hit in small business and again self-inflicted with some of our changes when you think about moving some clients that were on dedicated service specialist to multi-products because they bought more. Remember, small being under 50, so they have multiple products also moving them to the online centers. So I think the impact on small was really more from retention, which we think is we will recover out of that now the things are kind of done. The mid market was more of an impact on sales from less opportunities coming out of the ACA year and a little bit more aggressive competition because I think everybody felt lower opportunities. I feel very good about where we are from a technology standpoint and a product offering, but the pricing got a little bit stronger. The pricing competition probably got a little bit strong. We still held our own pretty well there. But I think again if you look at sales growth, we were down from last year in total amount sold, but it was more even on a normalized basis to where we were the year before that. And so I think hopefully that clarified it a little bit. Tim McHugh : And when did you, the service alignment, was that in the fall you started rolling that out? Martin Mucci : Yes. It was really this last year is where most of it happened, this last fiscal year. We kind of finished up at the beginning of fourth quarter. A little of that went into the previous year too. But I think we saw the biggest impact during the middle of this year as we got around the selling season. I think we paid a little bit for more drop-offs in clients during that third to beginning of fourth quarter type of thing because of just issues with disruption and so forth. But that's done now and everybody's kind of in the right place and we have hired back up and we have got the tenure back up and the training and certification levels back up. Tim McHugh : When you say it's done now, have you seen, is that just I guess the change on your end is done? Or have you seen enough data points in terms of retention metrics? Has it been long enough that you look at kind of the client behavior to say your past issues with that? Martin Mucci : What I would say is, the changes are done and the numbers as far as having the client service specialists in place, the tenure, the certification, that's done. And some of the satisfaction numbers, net promoter scores, have begun to increase back kind of towards where we were. I wouldn't say the retention has changed yet. That's going to take a little longer over, I think the next few quarters to get back. But we feel like we are aiming to get ourselves back to all-time highs or near all-time highs by the end of the fiscal year. Tim McHugh : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now open. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much. I know it's late. Efrain, just a couple of numbers related questions. Efrain Rivera : Sure. Go ahead. Jeff Silber : As far as giving the seasonal guidance on the revenue line, anything to point out on the margin or expense side? Efrain Rivera : No, Jeff, other than what I said in first quarter that that's the anomalous quarter just because we booked the stock-comp expense benefit in that quarter and so on a GAAP basis I called out that first quarter is going to be essentially flat year-over-year. So I think that's the other. And then and then obviously we show a decent improvement in margin. And that I think should get you where you need to be in terms of your modeling for the year. Jeff Silber : Okay. Great. And then in terms of annual numbers for share count and capital spending, what should we be looking for? Efrain Rivera : Good question. So CapEx will be in the range of about 3.5% of sales and the share count at the same level or slightly below. Jeff, when I say slightly below, half a million to a million shares could be as low as that for the year. Jeff Silber : Okay. Fantastic. Thanks so much. Efrain Rivera : Compared to this year, I should say. So okay, thanks. Jeff Silber : Got it. Thanks. Efrain Rivera : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from the line of Mark Marcon from R. W. Baird. Sir, your line is now open Mark Marcon : Good morning, Marty and Efrain. I was wondering if you could drill down a little bit more with regards to just the client service. With regards to the small-market clients, so those with 10 to 50 employees, are they still primarily serviced by one single client service associate? Or is it going into a team? Martin Mucci : No. They are still to a dedicated payroll specialist that we have always been known for. They are still with the dedicated. What's happening is, as more clients have moved to online, our model was a call-out model. So we called you at 10 o'clock, 10:00 AM every Monday morning to get your information. Or you could do it other ways, of course. But that was normal. And as more clients move to online, they were doing it themselves, calling in. The answer performance wasn't as strong as we would like. We started moving more online clients to a ded, what we called a dedicated service center. You are still assigned a dedicated person but you can reach anyone in that case. But the normal client who is not online gets a dedicated payroll specialist who still calls out for them. Mark Marcon : Great. And then was the attrition any different between, I am not talking about the micro-part of the market, but between say companies with 10 to 20 relative to 50 and above? Martin Mucci : I would say it was roughly the same. The impacts were kind of across the board, maybe for different reasons. But all the clients, because most of the clients did see some, many of the clients did see some change, even as you talk a little bit larger, many of them went from the local person who was just there to a dedicated to a multi-product service center and so they were serviced, not only with a dedicated person but more of a team. They may have reached someone different. So I would say it was kind of split across the different size clients. Mark Marcon : But I mean, they should be reaching the same person, I mean on a go-forward basis. Your primary contact should still be your primary person, right. Martin Mucci : Correct. Now one to go-forward basis, but I may have moved you, but I did move many of them to a new person during the year to get them in the right kind of service model but now they have a dedicated person. No matter where they are, they still have a dedicated person. And so now that's why we feel, hey, I think we are in good shape now, but it certainly caused some disruption. And you might have had a new person who was brand new in some of these cases because we pulled a tenure person to go to a multi-product service team and then they got a new person who wasn't as trained, was not the same person they knew for the last couple of years and that did have some impact, unfortunately. But we think this is the right setup for the future. We are done and we are building expertise now in those areas. Mark Marcon : Okay. And the net promoter scores, how are they indexing relative to your norms? Martin Mucci : They are coming up. So our onboarding, we also moved to a new way of onboarding our clients that we think is more efficient and better service value to them. That onboarding and net promoter score has gone up from the beginning of the year nicely and our overall service number has gone up as well. So we are feeling like it's early from the fourth quarter results, kind of, the end of the fourth quarter, but we are feeling like things are turning very positive. Mark Marcon : Okay. And then of the 605,000 clients that you have, how many have solutions that would typically be within HRS? I am not asking about specific penetration, but just overall like how many would have multiple modules? Efrain Rivera : Hi Mark. I think we will disclose that in the K. So we have got a pretty extensive disclosure as to who takes what there. And I think you will be able to see that revenue kind of, I can't recall it off the top of our head. Mark Marcon : Okay. Thank you very much. Martin Mucci : Okay. Mark, thanks. Operator : Thank you. The last question will come from the line of Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Ma'am your line is now open Lisa Ellis : Hi. Good morning guys. Efrain, a couple quick ones for you. Can you remind us of how you think about your dividend policy when you go through the sort of periods of ups and downs? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Lisa, we peg it at about 80% to low-80s in terms of percentage of net income and that's kind of what we target as a payout rate. Lisa Ellis : Okay. So the growth rate and the dividend gets impacted when the business kind of go through elevated periods of faster growth and then slower growth? Efrain Rivera : Right. So if it slows down and we try to just target, titrate it down a bit so that it stays in that range. Lisa Ellis : Okay. And then the second one somewhat related I guess is, you did call out that cash flow from operations was down 6% year-on-year but highlighted just fluctuations in working capital. So is your expectation that that would revert year-to-year? Or is it more also driven by underlying performance? Martin Mucci : No, not at all. That was anomalous. So what ended up happening Lisa is, if you break down what happened this year, we had about $60 million more in tax payments. Some of those are temporary differences that will reverse in the following year. We had additional funding requirements for Advance Partners that were unusual because right at the end of the year we brought on a very large client. Those situations should not be present next year. So it will conform to more customary patterns, but it's pretty identified what exactly happened there. Lisa Ellis : Okay. Terrific. That's it from me. Thanks guys. Martin Mucci : Thanks. Operator : Thank you everyone. At this time, we don't have questions on queue. Speakers, you may proceed. Martin Mucci : Okay. At this point, we will close the call. If you are interested in replaying the web cast of this conference call, it will be archived for about 30 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our fourth quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point. May I introduce your speaker for today, President, Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead. Martin Mucci : Thank you, Anna, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2017. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days, and you can access our earnings release and the Form 10-Q on our Investor Relations webpage. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about a month. On today\u2019s call, I will review the business highlights for the first quarter and Efrain will review our first quarter financial results in more detail and discuss our full-year guidance. Then we will open it up for your questions. We started fiscal 2018 with solid growth across our major HCM, human capital management product line, excuse me, in particular, our HR outsourcing services and our time and attendance solutions have continued to perform well. Total service revenue grew by 4%. We anticipated some tempering of the growth rate as a result of challenging comparisons with the prior year first quarter, which benefited from tailwinds related to the Affordable Care Act sales. Providing excellent service to our clients remains a top priority. And we announced during last quarter\u2019s call that we completed the realignment of our service organization, our investment in this service realignment was an important strategy to help support our long-term growth, as well as an example of our priority and commitment to providing the best service possible to our clients. With the realignment completed, we are beginning to see some benefits in the first quarter compared to the latter half of 2017. Excuse me, I\u2019m also very proud of the work our employees did for the \u2013 to provide critical service to our clients impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma that had major impacts on businesses in Houston and throughout Florida. The contingency planning and execution was excellent and an important reason why our clients count on Paychex and the strength of our people in numerous locations to support them in difficult times. We do expect that the hurricanes will have an impact on our sales and revenue in the next quarter, this current quarter that we\u2019re in now. As businesses may be forced out of business, at least, temporarily, however, we also expect that over the next few quarters this may be somewhat offset with an increase in small businesses needed to help these areas recover. On August 21, we announced our acquisition of HR Outsourcing or HROI, and all of its operating subsidiaries, HROI is a national PEO that serves small and mid-sized businesses in more than 35 states. We are excited about this acquisition, as it further strengthens our presence in our existing experience and successful sales and service teams in the PEO industry. This is particularly relevant during a time of regulatory change, and together with HROI, we share a strong commitment to the PEO business. This expansion of our presence in the PEO industry along with our certification by the IRS under the Small Business Efficiency Act positions us to accelerate growth of our comprehensive HR solutions. Small business job growth has continued to moderate during the first quarter after the sharp uptick we experienced last year \u2013 the end of last year, following the conclusion of the presidential election. While small business job growth has slowed or moderated, hourly earnings continue to gain momentum. The combination of the steadily rising wages and consistent small business job growth are indicators of the healthy small business sector. We also announced plans in this quarter for a new building \u2013 multi-building Paychex campus based in Rochester, New York. This involves the purchase of five buildings in the renovation of over 300,000 square feet of existing space in Rochester for a total estimated cost of around $60 million. This campus will result in the consolidation of currently leased space in the Rochester area. Also, during the first quarter, we announced a partnership with the Latino Tax Professionals Association or LTPA. As a result of the affinity agreement, the LTPA has designated Paychex the preferred provider of payroll and HR services for the organization and its members. We\u2019re proud to be a partner with the LTPA furthering our ongoing commitment to the Hispanic-owned business community with Spanish language tools and resources. We recently announced the release of Same Day ACH Debits functionality for clients using direct deposit. With Same Day ACH, employers now have the flexibility to reverse a payroll and have money debited from employee bank accounts on the same day, avoiding the costly time lag associated with payroll reversals. This continues to enhance our position as a leader in this payments industry. Next week at HR Tech, we will be introducing our new product bundles that are in the market. These bundles include new simplified pricing and options for paperless onboarding for our clients, employees and do-it-yourself online handbook. We will also be offering a retina scan time clock, and we are excited about these new offerings, as they respond to the evolving needs of our clients. We continued our history of dividend increases in this quarter and strong shareholder commitment with an announcement of a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend during the same this quarter \u2013 first quarter, and our quarterly dividend now stands at $0.50 a share. In addition, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of common stock or a total of $94.1 million to offset dilution. Lastly, let me take a few minutes now and highlight some of the notable recognition we received this past quarter. For the seventh consecutive year, we were again ranked as the largest record keeper for \u2013 by a total number of defined contribution plans by PLANSPONSOR magazine. In addition, this year, we also earned the ranking of largest 401(k) record keeper by total plans with less than $10 million in assets, as well as one of the leading providers of \u2013 by number of plans added in 2016. Our Paychex insurance agency team ranked number 21 on Business Insurance magazine\u2019s 2017 list of the top 100 brokers of the U.S. business. This is our seventh appearance on the list, up two spots from number 23 on the 2016 list, once again we rank as one of the fastest-growing insurance agencies in the nation. We ranked number 5 on Selling Power magazine\u2019s 2017 list of the 50 best companies to sell for. This is the fifth consecutive year Paychex has appeared on the list moving up from number seven spot last year. We\u2019re proud to create and support a culture that is entrepreneurial, results oriented and employee and client-focused and attract some of the best sales teams in the country. With that brief overview of our first quarter, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Marty. Good morning. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and as such, involve some risks, refer to the customary disclosures. I\u2019ll start by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter. I\u2019ll provide greater detail in certain areas and wrap up the review of our fiscal year 2018 outlook. Total service revenues grew 4% in the first quarter to $803 million. Interest on funds held for clients increased 14% for the first quarter to $14 million as a result of higher interest rates earned. Expenses increased a modest 2% for the first quarter, compensation-related costs were relatively flat. While investment in technology and growth in the PEO contributed to the slight uptick in expenses. Our effective income tax was 34.4% for the first quarter compared to 33% in the prior year\u2019s first quarter. Both periods reflected net discrete tax benefits related to employee stock-based compensation payments. The discrete tax benefit for the first quarter was $5 million, or approximately $0.01 per share. For the prior year quarter, it was $13 million, or approximately $0.04 per share. Last year\u2019s benefit was higher due to greater stock option exercise activity driven by stock price. Talk about payroll revenue, increased 2% for the first quarter to $458 million. The growth was driven by an increase in revenue per check due to price increases, net of discounting. On the HRS side, revenue increased 7% to $345 million for the first quarter. This reflects strong growth in client bases across all major HCM services, including: our comprehensive HR outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance, and insurance services. Within HR services, we continue to see strong demand, which along with the acquisition of HROI is reflected in continued solid growth in the number of client worksite employee served. We had a really good quarter from a WSE growth in the \u2013 particularly, in the PEO. Insurance services benefited from continued growth in the number of health and benefit applicants and higher average premiums within our workers\u2019 compensation insurance offering. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of participant funds. As indicated in the June call, we anticipated the growth in HRS revenue would be below the low-end of our annual guidance range for the first quarter. The two biggest factors driving this were the first quarter, as Marty mentioned before, benefited from the tailwinds of ACA, both in terms of our ACA module, as well as overall demand for HR outsourcing solution. Increased regulations spurs more outsourcing of HR services. This growth was anticipated to abate as the year progresses. The first quarter last year benefited from the inclusion of advanced partners, which was not acquired until December of 2015, now that the quarter is a comparable and both included Advance, we\u2019re not seeing that level of uplift, although Advance continues to do well. Advance, I\u2019ll remind you contributed approximately 2% to HRS growth in the prior year. Look at investments and income. Our goal, as you know, is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, primary short-term investment vehicles, our bank demand deposit accounts in variable rate demand notes. In our longer-term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds in U.S. government agency securities. The long-term portfolio has an average yield currently of 1.8% and an average duration of 3.3 years. Combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.4% for the first quarter, which is up from 1.2% last year. The average balances for interest on funds held for clients were relatively flat for this first quarter. And now I\u2019ll walk you through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $851 million, as of August 31, 2017. Funds held for clients as of August 31 were $5 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31, 2017. Funds held for clients, as you know very widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.8 billion for the quarter. Our total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $39 million as of August 31, compared with net unrealized gains of $32 million as of May 31, 2017. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was 1.9 billion as of the end of August, reflecting a $179 million in dividends paid and $94 million of shares repurchased during the first quarter return our return on equity for the past 12 months was a stellar 42% Our cash flows from operations were $344 million for the first quarter, an increase of 17% over the prior year period, if you remember, fourth quarter called out some timing that we thought would reverse in the quarter. It did indeed do that in the first quarter, and this change was primarily a result of higher net income along with positive cash flow impacts from timing-related income taxes and PEO payroll, accruals and unbilled receivables, which can fluctuate based on the timing of period and compared to payroll check dates. We\u2019re updating our guidance to reflect the recent acquisition of HROI, as well as the discrete tax benefit recognized in the first quarter. We would recommend that our \u2013 we remind you, sorry, that our outlook is based on the current view of economic and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes, the guidance for the full-year of fiscal 2018 that we just updated is as follows : HRS revenue growth is anticipated now to increase in the range of 12% to 14% for the full-year, raised to incorporate anticipated PEO revenues from HROI. To add color on gating, we were below the low-end of the range for HRS growth in the first quarter at 7% and we anticipate that HRS growth will be in the range of 13% to 16% for the second quarter and should help adjust your models. Total revenue, as you see in our announcement, is expected now to grow 6% this total company revenue. Our operating margin is anticipated to be in the range of 39% to 40%, said approximately 40% for the first time, modifying that very slightly. Our effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 35% to 35.5%, again, a modest adjustment there and the remainder of the guidance remains unchanged. However, I will reiterate a few items for you. Payroll service revenue is anticipated to be in the range of 1% to 2%. While we expect full-year payroll revenue growth to remain in this range, we believe, as Marty mentioned, the impacts of Hurricane Harvey and Irma are anticipated to result in growth for the second quarter that will be at the low-end of this range, so modifying that slightly. Interest on funds held for clients is anticipated to grow in the mid to upper teens, reflecting the benefit of recent increases in short-term rates. We haven\u2019t assumed anything yet with respect to a potential Fed rate rise in December. When that occurs, we will \u2013 if it occurs, we will update guidance. Investment income net expected to be in the range of $9 million to $11 million, and adjusted net income, non-GAAP expected to increase approximately 7%. Adjusted net income excludes the impact of the discrete tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2017 and the first quarter of fiscal 2018 relating to employee stock-based compensation payment. We currently have not planned any additional discrete tax benefit from employees stock-based comp payments for the remainder of the year due to the level of uncertainty involved. Please refer to the non-GAAP financial measures discussion in our press release and in our investor presentation for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to GAAP basis net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, as well as further discussion regarding our use of this measure. GAAP basis net income is anticipated to increase approximately 5%. Finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP, again is anticipated to increase in the range of 7% to 8%. Again, this measure also excludes the impact of the discrete tax benefits recognized in both years. I\u2019ll turn it back to Marty. Martin Mucci : Thanks, Efrain. We will now open the call to questions. Anna, please? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of Merrill Lynch America. Your line is now open. Jason Kupferberg : Great. Thank you. Hey, guys, how are you? Martin Mucci : Good Jason. Jason Kupferberg : Good, good. I just wanted to start by asking about what you saw from a new sales and client retention perspective in Q1? Obviously, last year, you had the tough comp on new sales and you did see some of the headwinds on retention near the back-half of the fiscal year when you made some adjustments to the client service model. So through the first quarter of 2018, at least, directionally, can you tell us what you saw from those metrics, as well as how you see them evolving during the balance of fiscal 2018? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think, from a retention standpoint, I think, what we feel, I mentioned a little bit in my comments. But I feel like after having got through the service kind of reorganization and settled back out and now the tenure of the payroll specialist in those different locations is increasing. We feel like we\u2019ve seen that \u2013 we see \u2013 are seeing an improvement in the retention numbers. It\u2019s early in the year, but in the first quarter, it seems like the mix is better and particularly larger clients, we\u2019re seeing an improvement from the last-half of last year. From the sales perspective, I think, kind of a continuation of where we were in the second-half of last year. We feel very good about how we\u2019re positioned for the rest of the year and particularly for selling season. We\u2019re rolling out at HR Tech next week some new product bundles. We\u2019re simplifying the pricing in many of the bundles. We\u2019re adding some things that we feel will be very helpful in the kind of mid-bundle, bundles which is a paperless onboarding offering, so that clients can send an e-mail to a brand new employees, and they can complete everything paperlessly and then send it electronically to update the payroll system, and also an online do-it-yourself handbook. We\u2019ve always had the full handbook service, where our folks are involved in a personal basis talking to the client. And we heard from more clients that many of them would just like a simple handbook that they could do it themselves online, and that\u2019s also being introduced actually has been introduced right now, but it will be talked about at HR Tech. So I feel pretty well-positioned. I think, the competitive environment is about the same. It hasn\u2019t gotten a lot more difficult, but it hasn\u2019t gotten any easier, and we\u2019re kind of plugging along and looking forward to selling season. Jason Kupferberg : So do you still expect that for full-year fiscal 2018 new sales growth will turn positive. I know you were down modestly year-over-year in 2017, but do you still expect that to turn positive in fiscal 2018? Martin Mucci : Yes, sure. We definitely do. We feel like we\u2019ve got the right products. We\u2019ve changed to \u2013 I think we\u2019d talked about this that we\u2019ve talked more now upfront to clients about the \u2013 it\u2019s our, what we would call, go-to-market strategy. So we\u2019re talking more about our full HR value and selling more products upfront. So that seems to be taking up pretty well, particularly in certain areas of the country. And we\u2019ve shifted some of the smaller sales to an inside telesales team, because clients were reacting to web leads. We\u2019ve increased our web. We do see more leads coming in. And we\u2019re trying to -\u2013 we\u2019re \u2013 we got to get that tenure built up of the new telesales team here from the first quarter. But we feel good that that\u2019s going to close more sales on the under five inside, because they\u2019re reacting to the client even faster without visiting them. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. And just last quick one for me. I saw that the buybacks resume this quarter, which is good to see. Any read through from that as far as near-term potential on acquisitions? Efrain Rivera : You mean, are they linked. Jason Kupferberg : Well, is there any diminished probability of near-term acquisition, just given the resumption of buyback activity or yes? Efrain Rivera : No, Jason, I wouldn\u2019t. We \u2013 I\u2019d mentioned, I think fourth quarter that we\u2019d buyback shares with a modest bias downward. If you look at our share count, that\u2019s exactly what happened. Jason Kupferberg : Yes, perfect. Okay, thanks for the comments, guys. Martin Mucci : You\u2019re welcome, Jason. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Your line is now open. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thank you. Martin Mucci : Hi, Ashwin. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Hey, guys, how are you doing? I guess, my first question is, just a clarification, is the entire change in the outlook explained by the acquisition and the tax rate change? Efrain Rivera : Yes, I would say that predominantly is the reason for the change, so updating it for the acquisition. And then the way the stock comp expense works is that \u2013 has an impact on tax rate. So at this point, that\u2019s what\u2019s driving it. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Right, right, okay. And how big is PEO now overall after the HROI acquisition? Efrain Rivera : We don\u2019t separately \u2013 we don\u2019t break it out yet and we\u2019ll have to get through the end of the year, I can update it. It\u2019s \u2013 I think, the last thing we said was that, ASO and PEO combined when we updated, it was about half of HRS that\u2019s as far as we went. We\u2019ll update it as we get to the end of the year. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Okay. And then I wanted to kind of get to sort of the impact of the hurricanes. Could you kind of break that down a little bit with regards to payroll client growth, PEO impact, particularly in Florida, because I believe you do Florida a little differently than the other states. Could you kind of go through that? Efrain Rivera : Go ahead. Martin Mucci : Efrain, can get more into the numbers. I think, it\u2019s early actually right now to really know, but we\u2019re trying to track really all of \u2013 almost all of Florida was impacted and then that Houston area. And so what we\u2019re trying to determine is, are they just kind of out for a week? Are they out for three weeks? Are they out permanently? And then, as I said, we also see that there\u2019ll be some bounce back and, because I think, there\u2019ll also more contractors and so forth coming into town to fix roofs, landscaping and some of the water issues, so the damage. So I don\u2019t think we have it quantified at this point, but we will really get a better sense kind of probably in the next few weeks as to whether these clients are out permanently or not. Ashwin Shirvaikar : And if you could comment on the difference with regards to PEO in Florida, because that\u2019s a different risk profile, right? Martin Mucci : Yes, I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 they tend to be, excuse me, a little bit larger clients. So I\u2019m not sure that they\u2019ll be out of businesses as much and the risk. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll see, how much we\u2019ll see, because most of the damage \u2013 much of the damage, at least, Florida was a lot of landscape damage, not as much structural damage from what we\u2019ve seen and clients are out, because they were out because of electricity or and some are water damage. So I don\u2019t \u2013 we won\u2019t see a big difference with the PEO, and I don\u2019t think there will be a big insurance impact from a health perspective, or maybe from a business property, but not necessarily from a health perspective than what we could say. Efrain Rivera : Yes, the only thing I\u2019d add to that Ashwin is, of course, we\u2019d quantified it, which is why we expressed some caution on payroll service revenue. PEO benefits to some extent from the fact that we also have an acquisition there. So we\u2019ve got a little bit more flexibility in terms of calling out at that range. But my caution is informed by the fact that I\u2019ve beenthrough this once before with Sandy, and we thought that bounce back would be very quick. We saw some impacts at the end of this first quarter from the hurricane. We saw some going into the beginning of the quarter two. And so the challenge is going to be, does that persist? Does it bounce back quickly? And my experience from Sandy is that, whatever you think is going to happen, it probably is going to happen a little more slowly. So that that\u2019s the thought process we have. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. No, that\u2019s fair. No, that\u2019s good to understand. Thank you, guys. Martin Mucci : Okay. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Danyal Hussain of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Danyal Hussain : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Efrain Rivera : Hey, Danyal. How are you doing? Danyal Hussain : Hi, Efrain. Good. Just a couple of clarifying questions on the acquisition? Efrain Rivera : Okay. Danyal Hussain : So could you tell us \u2013 I didn\u2019t see it, but can you tell us when it closed? And then it looks like, it\u2019s somewhere in the vicinity of $65 million to $70 million in annualized revenue, is that right? And the way you had tweaked your outlook suggests maybe it\u2019s mid somewhere in the teens from a margin perspective and I\u2019m guessing a lot of that is \u2013 go ahead? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Those are all good guesstimates there, Danyal. So we closed it in mid-August, so it really had essentially no impact very, very modest impact this quarter one. The revenue is between 4% and 5% of the total HRS revenues, so that\u2019s what our expectation is for the balance of the year. And then with respect to margins, it\u2019s very modestly dilutive in the year. So, operating margins now are not what we expect they will be in a year or so from now, so and that\u2019s our history of acquisitions. Danyal Hussain : Got it. And is there anything you could tell us about the purchase price? The [Multiple Speakers] Efrain Rivera : Yes, hey, we disclose it. I\u2019ll tell you two things. One is, it\u2019s going to be in the Q, so we\u2019ll have a Q out in a couple of days. I think, refer to page six, a compensation \u2013 the consideration structure was a little bit different than some of the other deals we do, it was about 60% cash, 40% stock and there were some performance gates in there. So you won\u2019t be able to get the complete amount that or how it\u2019s structured, but that will give you a good idea of what we paid for it. Danyal Hussain : Okay. And maybe just a couple more questions on PEO more broadly. Is there \u2013 do you see a lot of opportunity for additional deals in this space? And how are valuations looking? And then separately, Efrain, you called out the WSE growth looking healthy in the quarter. Is there anything specific that you can think of that drove it, or anything maybe unique about where those clients were coming from? Thanks. Martin Mucci : Danyal, I\u2019ll start, it\u2019s Marty. I think, yes, we still see a lot of opportunity. There\u2019s a number, obviously, a large number of PEOs around the country, and we do think there\u2019s some opportunity there. We were very careful about who we select and who we get involved with, given the risk, obviously? I think we\u2019ve done very well with our own risk. And we certainly don\u2019t want to mess that up, so we\u2019re very careful about who we get involved with. We\u2019re excited about the HROI team, because they add to the great experience that we already have in our PEO and both kind of committed to that full PEO HR outsourcing. So we think there is still opportunity there. We also \u2013 it is probably the fastest growing product line we have is HR outsourcing in total, that we service over a million worksite employees. And the growth there and worksite employees, I think, has been a combination of the businesses that we\u2019ve selected have been good solid clients that are adding. If you look at our small business jobs index that just came out today as well, growth is moderated back to our base year, but that\u2019s still a steady growth in jobs. And now you\u2019re also seeing wage increases, at least, in small business under 50 approaching the 3% kind of across the board. So that\u2019s a pretty healthy environment that even you\u2019ve got the moderate job growth of the clients and you\u2019ve got wages going up as well all good for us. And right now, the larger you get from a PEO standpoint sometimes the better relationships you have with the carriers and better opportunity there too. Danyal Hussain : Got it. Thank you very much. Martin Mucci : Okay. You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Jim Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you can maybe talk a little bit about the thing we\u2019ve been talking about for a year now, which is the ACA. And whether you feel like clients in the mid-market are finally getting unstuck in terms of new bookings at this point. And what do you just hearing? Go-forward, do you feel like that mid-market demand environment is finally starting to kind of fully normalize? And related to that, is there any kind of hangover impact from the DOL rules? Martin Mucci : I think, on the Affordable Care Act, what we\u2019re seeing frankly is clients kind of holding in place. And so, we\u2019re still continuing to sell a bit of the product, but we got well penetrated into the base with the product. And we\u2019re not seeing many clients take the product out, they\u2019re not dropping the product. I think, there is just such confusion as to what\u2019s going to end up and many of the proposals still have kept some of the reporting requirements. So even if things change, the reporting requirements may still be in place, even though the mandatory \u2013 some of the mandatory rules might not be in place. So I think, there\u2019s just so much confusion right now that what we\u2019re seeing is clients basically holding on to the product and getting a benefit in a value out of it and being sure that they\u2019re protected based on the amount of reporting that is required at the end of the year. So that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re seeing there. On the \u2013 I think, you mentioned \u2013 where you\u2019re mentioning the overtime rules as well? Jim Schneider : Yes. Martin Mucci : I think, that really is also \u2013 it\u2019s been a good opportunity for us. I think, a lot of clients have because of that and now being, of course, delayed and probably not going into effect, but clients still have found the need for time and attendance. Time and attendance has grown very well for us. And to the degree that now, I may have mentioned this earlier, we\u2019re introducing \u2013 in the next few months, we\u2019re introducing a retina scan clock. What we found was a number of small manufacturing firms and so forth use biometric finger scan or hand scan, but it\u2019s problematic in certain environments, dirt and your oily environments. So we found a retina scan clock and we\u2019re introducing that, and I think, we\u2019re the first of the \u2013 certainly, sizable payroll companies to offer that as part of our HCM solutions. So it looks, I mean, right now those changes \u2013 those regulatory confusion and issues have been positive for us. Jim Schneider : That\u2019s helpful, thanks. And maybe as a follow-up, on the guidance, I don\u2019t want to get too nitpicky here. But if I just take the midpoint of both your payroll and HRS ranges and add the impact from float, I get a revenue total number that\u2019s a little bit closer to 7% than it is to 6%. So is that just kind of some level of conservatism? Is there \u2013 is it just the impact of the hurricane to the current quarter, or is there anything else in the underlying business that we should be thinking about that might take payroll to the lower-end of the 1% to 2% range versus the higher? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So I think for the year, Jim, I said 1% to 2%. You \u2013 everyone\u2019s model is a little bit different. I think, what you\u2019re seeing there is that, there\u2019s an element of conservatism in what we put out, and there\u2019s a little bit of uncertainty in terms of where Q2 ends up. So I think, that\u2019s the reason for that. Martin Mucci : But is it fair to assume that we know there\u2019s no reason ex-hurricane that you couldn\u2019t do, at least, a midpoint on the payroll side. Efrain Rivera : Ex-hurricane, but you just, you said a mouthful there, so it\u2019s true. I think, Jim, here is the issue and many people on the call know this. I was very confident when Sandy hit New Jersey about what the bounce back was, I happened to be wrong not the first time and probably not the last time. So, no, there\u2019s some caution there that that\u2019s the thought process. Jim Schneider : Fair enough. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Gary Bisbee : Hey, good morning, guys. Just wanted to ask one question on the cost. SG&A was a bit lower than we expected and the sequential decline in that appeared a bit larger than spend. Was there anything in particular you call out? Efrain Rivera : I think, it was some timing there, Gary. It was kind of broad base. We are \u2013 our expense \u2013 our expenses were planned to be year-over-year the growth to be more moderate. And we typically get a loop off to a little bit of a slower start in spending in a quarter and some really good \u2013 candidly some very good work on the op side in terms of cost containment and controls was helpful. And then sales, we really focused on sales efficiency and putting our plans together that gave us some benefits and then there was some timing, so it was pretty broad based. Gary Bisbee : Okay. But there\u2019s \u2013 would it be reasonable to assume that it\u2019s sort of normalized a bit over the next quarter or so? Efrain Rivera : Oh, yes, absolutely, yes, yes, that would be reasonable. Gary Bisbee : Okay. And then on the PEO acquisition, is there anything in the technology that that you\u2019re going to maintain, or is this really about getting scale buying the customers and you\u2019d planned to move them over to your technology in some interim period? Martin Mucci : I think, we\u2019re looking at that, Gary. We\u2019re \u2013 I think, there on, obviously a lease platform, that\u2019s pretty popular in the industry. And we\u2019re reviewing that along with compared to ours, which we feel very good about and we\u2019re going to see where that is. It does certainly build from a scale perspective. We also pick up a good strong management team that\u2019s been around, and we feel good about that. And I also, as I mentioned earlier, as you get more scale, you build even stronger relationships with the carriers \u2013 the insurance carriers. So it\u2019s a little bit about all of that. Efrain Rivera : Hey, one other thing I want to build on just because I\u2019ve read some motes in the time period after the acquisition was done. One of the things that when we look at a PEO is, we do multiple, multiple levered \u2013 levels of actuarial review of what that book looks like. And I can tell you that, there has been a number of assets on the market that we have to the first time thought they were good and the second time we just passed. So you can, I think, the market should understand that when we look at a deal and we look at their book of business, if that is not where we think it should be and we don\u2019t think the management team is going to manage it to the level that we want to manage. We just simply aren\u2019t interested in it, because we\u2019re not interested in netting that kind of incremental risk to our profile. So \u2013 and by the way, the other part to Marty\u2019s earlier point, a management team that is able to manage to the level of risk that we want. So that\u2019s very important to us. And you can assume, or you should assume that this acquisition and that management team pass that gate. So just wanted to add that to what Marty had said. Gary Bisbee : It\u2019s great. And then just one quick follow-up, the $60 million you referenced for the new campus in Rochester, what\u2019s the \u2013 I assume that\u2019s capital expense and what\u2019s the time period over which you\u2019ll spend that? Thank you. Martin Mucci : Probably over two to three years, it\u2019s going to take to refurb some of the buildings and so forth and put the investment in it, it\u2019s about a two to three-year project. Hopefully, shorter on more of the two-year timeframe. Efrain Rivera : And just to clarify to it, it replaces lease space, so it\u2019s not an incremental slug of expense. It actually in some ways saves us\u2026 Martin Mucci : Definitely. Efrain Rivera : \u2026expense going forward. So I just want to make that clear. Gary Bisbee : Great. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Eskelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Rick Eskelsen : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I was hoping you could talk about the service realignment with it now being done. I know it\u2019s early, but I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019ve noticed changes in client behavior, Marty, I think, you talked a little bit about seeing some better early signs on the retention. So what have you seen so far with that now being fully in place? Martin Mucci : Yes. The one thing I think, if you take different extremes, so you have a dedicated service center. So a lot of our clients that were online, our traditional model which is still the vast majority of our clients, we have a dedicated payroll specialist that calls out to the client at a specified time and works with the client and that model has continued and done well and so forth. But we had a number of online clients that are growing and they call in when they need something, or e-mail when they need something, and we put those teams together and have, what we call, a dedicated service center for online. You still have a dedicated person that\u2019s assigned to you, but you can \u2013 we have a lot better technology now, in fact, like e-mail technology, we track all e-mails, they can be moved all over the country to the various dedicated service center folks. And I think, our responsiveness on e-mail we\u2019re measuring in is much better and we\u2019re getting positive feedback on that from a promoter score and so forth. If you look at the multi-product, if you look at the mid-market, we\u2019ve built up multi-product service center, so instead of handling the payroll in one place and then transferring the cost to time and attendance teams or our 401(k) teams or HR administration teams, we\u2019ve now started putting these folks together in teams, and we\u2019re seeing some positive feedback from the clients from a perspective of, hey, everybody is in the same team and I\u2019m getting responsiveness. So the improvement that we\u2019re seeing is, we\u2019ve seen, at least, early in the year, we\u2019re seeing retention improve a little bit and the mix of the mid-market, which probably had the biggest change is also improving. And that\u2019s probably the biggest part. Of course, it\u2019s 7/24 service as well, and all that is we can put teams together. It was \u2013 we\u2019re able to use the experience, but have better service performance and responsiveness to our clients. Rick Eskelsen : And have you seen a change on the \u2013 on your employees side of things? I mean, I got to think that with the \u2013 during the change, there was probably some churn of your people. Internally, has that sort of stabilized? What have you seen from your internal service workforce? Martin Mucci : Yes, it has. Good question. We did see that spike up a little bit, because it\u2019s changed and some \u2013 or more growth were in certain locations, and so we had to add some new people. We have seen that the tenure do very well. In fact, we track the new hires and our performance on keeping new hires and building up their tenure has been \u2013 has improved dramatically here in the last six months. So, because we\u2019ve made an extra effort to be sure that once you onboard with us that we\u2019re getting trained and you\u2019re staying with us, so we have seen that. So that the turnover rate of the payroll specialist is down in this, what we call, senior rate, which is an experienced certified payroll specialist as you move up through our training modules during the first 12 to 18 months has gone up as well and it\u2019s getting back into the range that we like to see it from a seniority perspective. Rick Eskelsen : Thank you. Last question, Efrain, just clarifying. Did I hear correctly that the HROI acquisition closed mid-quarter, so to reflect that, at least, the cash portion is reflected on the current balance sheet? Efrain Rivera : Yes, that would be correct. So it closed in Mid\u2026. Martin Mucci : August. Efrain Rivera : \u2026not mid-quarter, sorry, Rick. Rick Eskelsen : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Bryan Keane : HI, just a couple of clarifications. On the HRS, Efrain, you talked about it spiking up a little bit of 13% to 16%. I\u2019d be curious just to make sure I understand the puts and takes here that drive that higher. Obviously, there\u2019s an acquisition there, there\u2019s easier comps. Just want to make sure I understand it? And then what it also means for the back-half for 3Q and 4Q, should be around those same growth levels? Efrain Rivera : Yes. On the second one, maybe a tad higher, but I think the comparable range is for the back-half, Bryan, and then you\u2019re right about Q2 tailwinds from ACA abate \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, headwinds from ACA abate a bit in second quarter and the comps get a little bit easier and then you have the acquisition on and that\u2019s basically what driving that growth rate Q2. Bryan Keane : Okay, helpful. And then you talked a little bit about rolling out some new products for simplifying pricing and going to pricing bundling, I think, you launched that at HR Tech, What is the overall impact to pricing in general then for something like this? And I guess, maybe you could just give us overall comments on how pricing is looking? And is there ways to increase price that can push pricing higher, or are you seeing any pricing pressure that would push it down? Thanks. Martin Mucci : Well, I think, we felt from, Bryan, we felt from the price increase in the spring, that we did okay. And it looks like and through the summer anyway that it\u2019s holding this pricing simplification is just we used to break out pricing. It was a little bit more confusing to clients and to new prospects and for the sales reps to present based on kind of some many checks and so forth, and we\u2019ve gone more to a subscription or more to a simplified pricing of, here\u2019s a base price and a price per check. And so it\u2019s a little simpler to present to the client. We\u2019ve heard that for some time and wanted to get that change. And then the product bundles, we\u2019ve had bundles for some time, but we revamped them and added some more features and functionality to the product bundles, including this in the second bundle in the range to start adding things like a do-it-yourself handbook online, as I mentioned, and in paperless a simple paperless onboarding, which we hear very strongly has been very positive on the mid-market side and now we\u2019re bringing it down to kind of the under 50, and then we\u2019ll be adjusting for background checks as well. We\u2019ve had that in the bundles in different ways. We\u2019re going to try to simplify that. And then also and not from the bundle standpoint, but also releasing the new clocks as well that we feel will be very popular in a fast-growing business segment for us. Bryan Keane : Okay. But the net impact of some of these pricing changes probably don\u2019t \u2013 it doesn\u2019t move the needle, or does it move\u2026? Martin Mucci : I don\u2019t think so by itself. No, we weren\u2019t looking necessarily, it\u2019s more of a simplification of it and a better presentation, which we think will increase sales and be easier for us to sell for the clients and easier for the clients to consume. But we don\u2019t expect that just changing the bundles to drive much change in the revenue. But we still feel like we have pricing power, at least, based on what we saw in the last price increase. Bryan Keane : Okay, helpful. Thanks so much. Martin Mucci : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Grossman of Stifel. Your line is now open. David Grossman : Thank you. Martin Mucci : Hey, David. David Grossman : Good morning. I\u2019m not sure if I missed this earlier. But did you talk at all about the strategic kind of rationale behind the HROI deal? What you saw in that company that was compelling, given that obviously you already have huge scale in the PEO business? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think, David, Efrain kind of touched on it a little bit. But I think, when you \u2013 when we look at PEO, so we think, we see HR outsourcing growing very quickly for us at kind of all sizes of clients. And it\u2019s really come down in size and we\u2019ve mentioned that probably many times before. We have both the PEO and the ASO model. We\u2019ve also been able to take a process of where if you\u2019re in the PEO and from an underwriting perspective, the risk isn\u2019t right for health insurance. We also move you \u2013 we can take you through the agency \u2013 the insurance agency now the 21st largest in the country. And so we\u2019re seeing positive from that standpoint too. And as we look at PEO, as we look at a lot of opportunities and we\u2019re very careful about a PEO that has good risk based on all the work that we do and pretty a few levels down that has a management team that we feel can scale. And that by adding even more scale to our business, there\u2019s still some pretty large PEOs out there. You gain some credibility and some leverage with the carriers \u2013 with the major carriers in the country, and that\u2019s a positive for us. So we look at a lot of opportunities and we select very few to go after and complete. David Grossman : But did HROI have any unique presences mostly a blue-gray business? And is that kind of a \u2013 impacts your presence in \u2013 with the workers\u2019 comp carriers, or is there something different about their model? Martin Mucci : No, I wouldn\u2019t say. So I would say that they \u2013 I would say just that they\u2019ve handled the risk extremely well that they\u2019re an experienced team and from a sales and operations perspective and \u2013 but they\u2019re pretty much across the country. And I think 35 states last we looked, and so we felt they added scale and not necessarily didn\u2019t certainly change our risk profile at all, but kept it very positive. So it wasn\u2019t any specific thing that they did. It was they were adding scale, which gives us more clout with carriers, for the pricing and gives us just that much more experience in sales and operations support. David Grossman : All right, great. Got it. And then just one other question unrelated. As you know, there has been a lot of recent debate about the margins related to the different segments of this industry, the small versus the mid-market, and I really don\u2019t want to drag you into that debate. But can you help us, at least, better understand in the context of your own business how the margins differ, if at all, between your small business and mid-market segments and what may drive that, in fact, if there is a difference? Efrain Rivera : Well, I think, David, I talked to a number of you. I think the at its most basic, pricing power changes as clients get larger and not surprising smaller clients are asking you do a lot more for them. And as a consequence of that, they\u2019re willing if you provide great service to pay for it. As you grow larger and you certainly are in the mid-market, now you have \u2013 typically have more back office support and help. That value of service is important, but it\u2019s different than when you\u2019re a 5% shop than when you\u2019re 60%. So pricing flexibility is a little bit more constrained and I mentioned that. So Marty said, pricing in general has been good, it\u2019s held, but we\u2019ve been cautious about how much price we\u2019ve increased in the mid-market, and I think that that continues to be an issue as you go up. The second thing I would say is that, increasingly, in order to service mid-market clients who have integrated product bundles, you need teams of service providers. And so the ratios are a bit different than small market clients. And that\u2019s why you\u2019ve seen in the industry not just us, but in the industry people go to multi-product products service centers. And you\u2019ve got, while you still can get efficiencies, the efficiencies are very different than when you\u2019ve got a small client. So combination of those tends to have an impact on pricing and margins and then throw in competition. So now you get the trifecta of more constraints there in the mid-market. So I think that many of those factors just are not as present until you get into the very, very low-end of the small market, there it\u2019s a little different discussion, because now you\u2019re talking about DIY providers and that\u2019s a different segment in the market. So I think, it is fair to say that the margin profiles are different. Martin Mucci : Yes, and I think, I just \u2013 the only thing I\u2019d add to that, I think, Efrain said it before too. We\u2019ve always been very mindful of keeping cost out of the business. It\u2019s hard once they\u2019re in to take them out, but we\u2019ve always been pretty careful about having a high margin business and not being largely in that small market, we\u2019ve been able to not to have to customize a lot of process and procedures, but keep our costs very low be able to set up a client very quickly even if they go out of business in six to nine months, which many do. We\u2019re able to set them up quickly and keep the costs out. We don\u2019t have a lot of layers of management. I mean, you know the business well. I mean, we\u2019ve been very careful about that. So I do think there\u2019s some differences in the businesses from that standpoint, but certainly everything Efrain said as well. David Grossman : All right. Great. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. Martin Mucci : Okay. Thanks Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMC. Your line is now open. Tien- tsin Huang : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just I think you answered with David Grossman. Just want to follow-up on the risk model for HROI. Is it a fully insured plan, or is it a minimum premium plan, sounds like it\u2019s more minimum premium just want to make sure? Martin Mucci : They tend to be more minimum premium, Tien-tsin. Tien- tsin Huang : Okay. But \u2013 and then I guess, for you, you were previously just out in Florida. So are they a little bit more geographically diversified? Martin Mucci : They\u2019re more Southeast-based, I\u2019d say, so a lot of it has an overlap. There\u2019s a little bit more in other states, but there\u2019s some overlap with what we already do. Tien- tsin Huang : Okay. No just want to make sure we caught the\u2026. Martin Mucci : No, thanks. Tien- tsin Huang : \u2026the difference there. Then the just a quick follow-up. Just the balance growth here going forward, it\u2019s been sort of 5% to down for a while, you guys mentioned age inflation and whatnot. So what\u2019s the outlook for balance growth? Martin Mucci : I think, we\u2019ll see modest client balance growth in the balance of the year. I can\u2019t call it precisely, but that\u2019s our expectation. Tien- tsin Huang : Got it. That\u2019s all I got. Thanks. Martin Mucci : Okay. Thanks, Tien-tsin. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Martin Mucci : Good morning. Efrain Rivera : Good morning. David Togut : Your major national competitor has recently talked about accelerating innovation, particularly introducing a new payroll engine, a new tax filing engine under pressure from an activist campaign. I\u2019m just curious how you respond to that and whether you think you need to accelerate your own innovation strategy over the next couple of years in response? Martin Mucci : I think, I definitely do. I think, we already have kind of it that innovation mindset. We\u2019ve been moving everything to and have moved everything in our development to mobile first and, for example. And so basically, everything is designed for a mobile phone use and then expands to the desktop if you\u2019re using the desktop. And so all of our development went agile from a development standpoint years ago to be able to crank things out faster and be able to carve pieces of the project up and get product out quicker. We went to mobile first from a design perspective. And we\u2019ve certainly are moving to always try to be and have our UI, our user interface always on the front of kind of the development that\u2019s out there as much as possible. So I think, I mean, I do think that\u2019s very important. I think, we feel good from the front end of these products, but always can do better and we\u2019re always pushing to say, hey, what are our competitors doing and what do we have to look like a year or two or three from now to start building that out? As a large company, you always got to do that in particular, I think. And then the back end, we feel very good about that keeping up as well. So whether it\u2019s our tax pay engine or anything, no one for other than one other company probably move \u2013 certainly move any money and more money than we do. And we\u2019re very proud of the fact that that goes extremely well, and we\u2019ve been doing it for many, many years. So, yes, I think, you always have to have that innovation mindset and we feel like we\u2019re always moving to keep up with it and be sure we\u2019re ahead of the competitors. Efrain Rivera : One of the thing, David, I\u2019d add is, if you look at what we did \u2013 Marty did five years or so ago, when we saw that we had a need for a DIY SaaS platform in the micro enterprise space, we went out and bought it. So one of the other things that we are not averse to is, if we see technology we like, we buy it, and then we integrate it. You have to be disciplined about doing that. I think, we\u2019ve done that very well with things like myStaffingPro, which is a talent onboarding and Marty just mentioned net time, which is our time and attendance product. We\u2019re constantly looking for that. And our mentality is, we\u2019re going to look for good technology and if it makes sense using our IT resources identify it and bring it into the fold. So it\u2019s not a solely our internal development. It also is part of our business development focus. Martin Mucci : Yes, a lot of things have changed. I mean, it\u2019s a really interesting question when you even think from how you interconnect with other \u2013 others through an API interface and we\u2019ve been active with that. And as Efrain said, we buy some technology sometimes to give us a fast start and then build it into our products. And like time and attendance and myStaffingPro for the HR onboarding and paperless onboarding. So we try to speed up the cycle as much as possible. David Togut : Understood. Just a quick follow-up question, have you seen any distraction impact on your principal competitor sales force during this proxy fight? Martin Mucci : I don\u2019t think so. I think the competitive environment seems to be about the same. It doesn\u2019t appear that, at least, from our standpoint that that has changed much at all. David Togut : Thanks so much for taking my question. Martin Mucci : All right, David. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon of Baird. Your line is now open. Mark Marcon : Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Martin Mucci : Hey, Mark. Efrain Rivera : Hey, Mark. Mark Marcon : A couple of quick questions. One, just topic in the news Equifax. To the extent that you believe that the data is now out there. Do you have to do anything incrementally in order to secure the data or to make sure that the right people are being paid or anything along those lines? Martin Mucci : I think, we\u2019ve always had very much a mindset of the security of our data. And in fact, we don\u2019t do anything with Equifax other than kind of some of our own employee kind of work that some large companies do. We don\u2019t pass client employee information to them. And we\u2019re always \u2013 and 21 of the fastest-growing areas over the years has been our IT security team. I remember, years ago when I started, it was probably six people, and it\u2019s much more like 10 times that, at least. And so we\u2019re very careful about what we\u2019re doing. I think multi-factor authentication coming out with MFA years ago and we\u2019re seeing \u2013 we\u2019re really pleased with the fact that when multi-factor authentication first came out, clients were taking the easiest way to do that. And now the majority has swung to what we call level two, which is what you see with most banks and so forth, which is getting a text if your call \u2013 if you\u2019re coming in to do your payroll from a PC, a laptop, or something a device that weren\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t recognize, you have to \u2013 you have signed up to get a text from us to verify who you are. We have seen incidents where our clients \u2013 for our clients go down dramatically. We never had a lot, but we had enough that we really pushed that and we\u2019ve seen that go down. And so we see the clients paying a lot more attention to taking the precautions necessary, because small businesses in particular not always careful about sometimes about the laptop, but they\u2019re on the road, they\u2019re trying to do things, and we\u2019re trying to protect them. So we\u2019re very careful, very diligent about it. We know how sensitive our data is and we do our best to protect it. Mark Marcon : Okay, great. And then a couple of numbers questions. Just CapEx for the year now with the campus acquisition? Efrain Rivera : Yes, Mark, I think, we\u2019ve disclosed that, I think, we\u2019re at around $180 million is what we set out with the campus included. Mark Marcon : Okay. Efrain Rivera : I think we\u2019ve put a \u2013 noted it, don\u2019t hold me to that number, look in the Q, we set it out. Mark Marcon : All right. Great. And then with regards to HROI, the margins are guided down for Q2 through Q4? Efrain Rivera : Right. Mark Marcon : If the deal is modestly dilutive\u2026. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Mark Marcon : We did better in the first quarter, is that all explained by HROI, or is there maybe some conservatism in there? Efrain Rivera : I think it\u2019s primarily HROI, Mark. So \u2013 well, I mean, first of all, if you just take Q1 and then project forward and then say what the margin would be, I think, you end up getting a little bit of a incorrect view of the rest of the year. Just remember that some of that was timing. And as we get into other quarters in recent years, our margins in Q1 have been the highest of the year, so\u2026 Mark Marcon : Oh, yes. I get that. I know the normal seasonal pattern, but it seems like it\u2019s a little \u2013 just a tad more than I would have expected? Efrain Rivera : Yes. No, we\u2019re not trying to be overly conservative, we\u2019re trying to be as realistic as we can. I will say this, that in most instances, this is my seventh year here doing it, we\u2019re pretty much on what we say. So I think that that\u2019s our expectation at t his point. Mark Marcon : Okay. And then the EPS doesn\u2019t go up much for the deal? Efrain Rivera : For EPS going up for the deal, Mark? Mark Marcon : Yes. Efrain Rivera : No, because it\u2019s actually modestly dilutive. Mark Marcon : Just to the margins, but\u2026. Efrain Rivera : Yes. No, no, but it doesn\u2019t. No, it\u2019s not going to help EPS this year. Mark Marcon : Okay, great. But then you did say that the margins will go up in the following year. Can you just give us a little more color on that? Efrain Rivera : No, no, Mark, I\u2019m not going to go there. So I have no idea at this point in time. Mark Marcon : You do. Efrain Rivera : [Multiple Speakers] By the way, I applaud you on your skillfulness asking, he declined to answer the question. Mark Marcon : I know declined, but not I have no idea. Efrain Rivera : You got it, yes. Mark Marcon : All right. Efrain Rivera : You have the modest idea, I won\u2019t talk about it though. Mark Marcon : Okay. Is it 50% is it roughly 50% Florida in terms of the worksite employee? Efrain Rivera : On the PEO? Mark Marcon : Yes. HROI? Efrain Rivera : I haven\u2019t disclosed that. We\u2019ll give more color on it. Mark Marcon : I know, but when we look at the offices and then think about the penetration in the markets? Efrain Rivera : I think, if you want to make a reasoned guesstimate there, I\u2019m not going to disagree with that. Mark Marcon : Okay, great. And then \u2013 and this with regards to the commentary on the price increase for this year that you\u2019ve always pass along at the usual fashion, usual date. Did that \u2013 was that on the lower-end of that traditional range? Efrain Rivera : Yes, it was, yes, it\u2019s on the lower-end of that range. Yes. Mark Marcon : Okay, great. And then as we think about just the new sales and all initiatives that you\u2019ve got in place, should we think about the growth in this upcoming sales season being more skewed towards the mid, or the lower-end of your client range? Martin Mucci : I don\u2019t think, it\u2019s skewed either way, Mark. I think, we\u2019ve got initiatives going across the board, so I don\u2019t see it skewed either way. We certainly got a number of initiatives like the inside sales and the additional web investment for the leads,. probably attacking more of the small end, but we\u2019ve also got a number of things with the bundles and other products that are attacking that mid-market. So I wouldn\u2019t say, it\u2019s going to be skewed any different. Mark Marcon : Okay. And just the same-day reversals that you\u2019re capable of doing now, how big of a deal is that going to be in terms of being able to get new sales? Martin Mucci : I think, it\u2019s going to take a little bit to catch on. I think the clients \u2013 this is one of those things, where clients don\u2019t realize what a benefit that is unique to us until they need it. So I think, it could help probably more on the retention than it may on the front end and on the sales side. When you have a \u2013 especially as online clients, if you make a mistake and I overpay Efrain and it takes me a week to undo it as opposed to I can undo it that same day without even a real impact to him, that\u2019s a huge benefit to the client. But I think it\u2019s going to be more of a retention benefit than it is probably a new sale benefit. Mark Marcon : I would use it as a sales as well? Martin Mucci : No, no, I would use it. I\u2019m just saying most clients see those things as, well, that\u2019s never going to happen to me. So I\u2019m not going to make a mistake, I\u2019m not worried about it. But you see that more and more as clients are doing more online, they\u2019re making those errors. And then if you can\u2019t reverse it that quickly and that employee quits or doesn\u2019t can\u2019t afford to pay you back, it\u2019s a real issue. So it \u2013 I\u2019m just saying, it tends to be, they believe it more once they see it and need it. Mark Marcon : Great. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Lisa Ellis : Hi, good morning, guys. Can you talk a little bit about how a client growth and checks per payroll are trending as you start into the new fiscal year? Efrain Rivera : We don\u2019t talk too much about either until we\u2019re through the year. So I would just say, Lisa, it\u2019s early to make a call on all that. Lisa Ellis : Okay. And then second one is just anything you would call out, sort of state level changes from a regulatory environment perspective? Like in the past, we\u2019ve seen things like overtime rule changes, et cetera. Is there anything like that on the horizon as we look out to the next few quarters? Martin Mucci : Yes, I\u2019d say, one of the things we\u2019ve seen quite a bit now are these state changes. I think the two biggest ones that are causing issues would be the overtime regulation \u2013 there\u2019s three, overtime regulation, family leave and minimum wage rules, because they\u2019re all very much \u2013 as the Fed has tried to reduce regulations, the states have picked them up and increased them and it\u2019s causing a lot of confusion for clients. So if I\u2019m a multi-state business and I\u2019m in two or three states, it\u2019s very difficult for me right now to track all the minimum wage changes that are happening by state and sometimes city. Family Leave now going to impact, and they\u2019re are all different. So what do I have to do from a family leave? What taxes am I \u2013 should I be deducting for family leave, like New York State they already kicked in before the actually the family leave, our benefit is even available January 1. So we\u2019re seeing family leave, overtime regulations and minimum wage are the three biggest changes happening kind of state by state. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Tim McHugh of William Blair. Your line is now open. Stephen Sheldon : Hi, it\u2019s Stephen Sheldon for Tim this morning. Yes, most of my questions have been answered. But you talked about seeing strong WSE growth for the PEO business. So can you maybe quantify what kind of growth you\u2019re seeing there organically? And how that compares with what you\u2019ve seen over the past few years? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So we don\u2019t update those numbers until the end of the year. But we \u2013 when I call out that number, I\u2019m calling out organic growth, not acquisition, obviously when we discuss that as we get to the end of the year. But I can\u2019t quantify it, but it\u2019s stronger \u2013 it was strong growth in the quarter in the double-digit range. Stephen Sheldon : All right. Thanks. Martin Mucci : Okay.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point. Now I'll open the meeting over to your host Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may now begin. Martin Mucci : Thank you, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of Paychex's Second Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2017. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days; you can access our earnings release and Form 10-Q on our Investor Relations webpage. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on the website for approximately one month. On today's call, I will review the business highlights for the second quarter and Efrain will review our second quarter financial results and discuss full-year guidance. And then we'll open it up to your questions. Well we're halfway through fiscal 2018 and we have continued to deliver solid results across all of our major human capital management product lines with growth of 7% in total service revenue for the second quarter. In particular our HR outsourcing services, retirement services and time and attendance solutions have continued to perform very well. On August 21, we announced our acquisition of HR Outsourcing Holdings Inc or HROI. HROI is a national PEO that serves small and mid-sized businesses in more than 35 states. The integration of HROI is progressed favorably. Combining the HROI team with our experienced PEO sales and service operations teams has further strengthened our presence in the PEO market. This is particularly relevant during a time of regulatory change like we're seeing now. This expansion along with our certification by the IRS under the Small Business Efficiency Act positions us for accelerated growth in our comprehensive HR outsourcing solutions. Small business job growth continue to moderate slightly during the second quarter after the sharper up tick experienced last year following the conclusion of the Presidential Election by contrast our early earnings have improved to an annual increase of nearly 3% based on our data. The combination of this level of wage growth and consistent moderate small business job growth are indicators of a healthy small business sector. We believe these promising indicators will continue to create opportunities for new sales in the small business market. At HR Tech in October, we introduced our new product bundles that are now in the market. These bundles include new simplified pricing and included in two of the mid level HCM bundles at no extra cost are Paychex Flex onboarding essentials providing a paperless employee onboarding experience and do-it-yourself handbooks. In addition, we introduced a retina scan InVision time clock. We are excited about these new offerings that respond to the evolving needs of our clients and we are pleased with the initial response from our clients and prospects. We are committed to delivering best-in-class technology solutions for our clients and business partners. We recently announced a release of Same Day ACH Debits functionality for our clients using direct deposit. With Same Day ACH, employers have the ability to reverse a payroll and have money debited from employee bank accounts on the same day, avoiding the costly time lag associated with payroll reversals. This enhances our position as a leader in this payments industry. We also announced real-time integration between Paychex General Ledger services and Sage Intacct. Paychex and Intacct are certainly two key service providers to the accounting industry and our CPA partners are important to our business and this integration provides better tools which allow them to gain inside into their data and their clients data in a real time basis. We also introduced Accountant HQ, a website for accounting professionals to help them service their Paychex clients even more effectively with a comprehensive online dashboard that provides a single source of immediate service access to authorized Paychex's client data robust reporting capabilities and variable accountant resources. We consistently evolve our service offerings to meet the needs the of clients base and example as we just had a recent announcement that Millennium Trust Company and Paychex have teamed up to offer a simple IRA to employers with a 100 or fewer employees with innovative features including auto enrollment and investment fiduciary services. This is becoming a popular offering, or be a popular requirement from some states across the U.S. We are proud of the recognition we have received regarding our solutions for our clients and our leading Hedge Technology Inc, recently recognized Paychex is the best HR outsourcing for small business overall. They noted that Paychex Flex our product offers a full range of services for HR outsourcing including payroll tax, payment benefits, recruiting and training and we do so without requiring a long-term contract. More uniquely Paychex also offers onsite assistance program that puts HR professionals, our HR generalist, our HR Gs in the office with customers when they need more help. We are proud that Paychex Flex was recently awarded a gold excellence in technology award for best advance in HR or workforce management technology for small and mid-sized businesses from Brandon Hall Group. In previous years we won the bronze award, this year moving up to the gold standard and we appreciate that this evidence is, this evidence is the strength of our technology as well as our service performance. As I noted last quarter, the seven, this is the 7th consecutive year, we were ranked the largest 401(k) recordkeeper by total number of defined contribution plans by PLANSPONSOR magazine and our Paychex Insurance Agency hit the rank of 21st, that to 21st largest agency from business insurance magazines. And we are very proud of all of this recognition because, it comes from and really it is deserved by the - deserved of the 14,000 employees who make it happen from sales to services to technology, innovation teams here at Paychex. We're very proud of them and the results that they have achieved. Providing excellent service to our clients remains a top priority of course and we've completed the realignment of our service organization at the end of last fiscal year and our investment in this service realignment was an important strategy to help support long-term growth as well as an example of our priority and commitment to providing the best service possible to our clients. With the realignment completed we are seeing benefits from this change. One last comment before I turn the call over to Efrain, yesterday of course Congress voted in the favor of tax reform legislation. We are currently reviewing the terms of the bill and analyzing the impact that we could have at the Paychex, Efrain will talk more about this later on. Tax reform will provide a great benefit to us and a lower effective tax rate. We do expect that a portion of the potential benefit will be reinvested to drive future growth for the company and our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results in more detail. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks Marty, and good morning. I would like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements referred to the customary disclosures. I'll start by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter, provide greater detail in certain areas and then wrap up with a review of the 2018 outlook. Service revenue, as you saw, grew 7% for the quarter to $813 approximately 3% little lesser that growth was attributable to HROI. Interest on funds held for clients increased 23% for the second quarter to $14 million as a result of higher average interest rates earned, you're starting to see the benefits of all these cumulative increases in interest rates. Expenses increased 7% for the quarter HROI though contributed about 5% of this growth. So we have very good growth expense control in the quarter, comp-related cost were up modestly and continued investment in technology and growth in the PEO also contributed to the slight up tick in expenses. Our effective income tax rate was 35% for the second quarter compared to 35.2% for the prior year's second quarter, both periods reflected net discrete tax benefits related to employee stock-based compensation. This impact to the second quarter was $0.01 accounting $0.01 of EPS and must be material in the prior year quarter. Let's talk about payroll service revenue, increased 1% in the second quarter to $445 million, the growth was driven by an increase in revenue per check and then it was tempered by the impact of client size mix from the same quarter a year ago, recall it as we ended the year we had a slight drop in client size and that's reflected in the payroll service revenue growth. On the HRS side, we grew 15% to $368 million for the second quarter, it reflected strong growth in the client base across major HCM services including comprehensive HR outsourcing services, retirement, time and attendance and insurance all saw a good growth in the quarter. Within Paychex HR Services, we continue to see the strong demand which along with the acquisition of HROI reflected in continued solid growth in the number of client work side employee served. So we're seeing growth there and we are seeing growth in other areas of the PEO. Insurance services benefited from continued growth in the number of health and benefit applicants in higher average premiums within workers comp insurance offering. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue and earned on the value of purchase have been fund. So all of those are contributing to the positive results in HRS. Year-to-date let me just say that total service revenue growth was 5% of which about 1%, 1.5% approximately was attributable both to HROI recall that Q1 was a lower quarter end we built from there. Operating income growth was 7% with margins of 41.2% up approximately 50 basis points year-over-year. Net income diluted earnings per share grew 6% on a GAAP basis to $445 million in a $1.23 respectively. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are both up 8%, and that just takes up the benefit of the discrete tax items that we recognized in both years. Investments and income, as you know we, our goal is to protect principle and optimized liquidity on the short-term side, primarily short-term investment vehicles are bank demand deposits and variable rate demand notes. In the longer term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government agency securities, the long-term portfolio as an average yield of 1.8%, an average duration currently at 3.3 years. The combined portfolio has earned an average rate of return of 1.5% for the second quarter up from 1.2% last year. We are starting to realize the benefit of gradually increasing interest rates as I mentioned earlier. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients was relatively flat for the second quarter primarily the impact of wage inflation was offset by client mix. Now let's look at our financial position remain strong. Cash and total corporate investments were $820 million as of November 30, 2017. Funds held for clients as of the same date were $4.9 billion compared to $4.3 billion; funds held for clients very widely as you know and averaged $3.7 billion for the quarter. Total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized losses of $14 million as of November 30, compared with net unrealized gains of $32 million as of May 31 and that's just a reflection of rising interest rates. Our longer term portfolio seen an increase in the unrealized losses for this reason. Total stockholders' equity was $2 billion as of November 30, 2017 reflecting $359 million in dividends paid and 94 million of shares repurchased during the first half of fiscal 2018, our return on equity for the past 12 months was a stellar 43%, now we just point out that was only a few years ago when return on equity is 34%. So, we have really worked hard on driving that number. Our cash flows from operations were $519 million for the first six months and I just also point out that we had a very strong cash flow quarter. The increase was 26%, although there is some timing in that also a function of our cash generating power. Let's look at the guidance for 2018. It's unchanged from what we've provided last quarter. This guidance doesn't reflect any impact from tax reform legislation. What we try to do in both the press release and you will hear in a second is supreme, what we think the ongoing benefit from tax reform will be for us. I would caveat heavily. That we don't know the exact details of the legislation and there will be regulations written that interpret the legislation that could have some impacts and changes to what we are discussing. We obviously were anxious to see the final bill just like everyone else, but we recognized that it will have an important impact to us. Payroll revenue was anticipated to grow in a range of 1% to 2%. Overall, we anticipate full year growth now will be at the lower end of the range with growth for the second half of 2018 comparable to the growth in the first half of the year. HRS revenue by contrast is anticipated to increase in the range of 12% to 14% for the full year incorporating HRI. We were below the low-end of the range for interest growth of first quarter at 7%. And we were above the range for the second quarter 15% now anticipate being above the range for the second half of the year. Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 6%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to grow in the mid to upper teens which doesn't include the most recent increase in the fed funds rate that we made earlier this month and the reason for this is, it's comprehended within that range and we think by the time the increases roll through, the impact for this year will be modest obviously will be beneficial to next year, but impact at this point is going to be modest. Operating income margin is anticipated to be in the range of 39% to 40%, effective income tax rate excluding any potential impact from tax reform legislation is expected to be in the range of 35%, 35.5%. Let me just add a note of explanation here. If you recall our guidance when we started the year, our guidance was that our tax rate would be between 35.5% and 36% that's what we consider our normalized tax rate currently when we don't include discrete tax benefit. The discrete tax benefit that we recognized year-to-date relating to stock-comp expense drive that rate down. So, when we say 10% to 12% benefit, we are working of at a normalized rate between 35.5% and 36%. And at this point, I would anticipate that we will provide more guidance but it could be anywhere along that spectrum at this point, if I had to peg it, I would say it's at the low end of the range rather than higher. Investment income net anticipated to be in the range of $9 million to $11 million. Adjusted net income is expected to increase approximately 7%. Adjusted net income excludes the impact of a discrete tax benefit recognized in fiscal 2017, in the first half of fiscal 2018 relating to employee stock-based compensation payments. We currently don't plan any additional discrete tax benefits for the remainder of the year. We simply don't know whether we will realize any. Please refer to our non-GAAP financial measures, discussion in our press release and in our investor presentation for reconciliation of non-GAAP measured to the GAAP basis net income for the second quarter in six months of the year. GAAP basis net income is anticipated to increase approximately 5%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is anticipated to increase in the range of 7% to 8% and again, we laid this out in the presentation that we've posted in Web site and this measure as I have mentioned now about 3x excludes the impact of a discrete tax benefits recognized. And then, finally, as I mentioned before we haven't recognized any benefit of tax reform in our guidance. We anticipated to be in the range of 10% to 12% on our annualized effective income tax rate I mentioned how we measure that that is before we include any discrete tax amounts related to employee stock-based compensation thing. And again, one more caveat, this is based on our current understanding of the legislation maybe subject to change upon further review of the final law and interpreted guidance that maybe issued. As discussed previously, we said this, Marty said, and we said in the press release, when you have an opportunity we expect that a portion of the benefits will be used to be reinvested in the business to drive future growth and we will provide additional guidance in upcoming quarters. One final comment on that and I suspect that this will be true for many companies, although that the statutory rate will drop to 21% that won't be the effective rate because there will be puts and takes in terms of benefits and deductions that no longer allowed under the law and that's the analysis that we are undergoing. Other thing that I would say is that we are undergoing an analysis for the opportunities that we have to reinvest, some of that benefit to drive growth and efficiency and enhance our customer experience and we are actively working on that as we speak. And with all of that, I will turn it back to Martin. Martin Mucci : Great. Thank you, Efrain. And we will now open the call to questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now being the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley. You may now ask your question. Danyal Hussain : Hi. Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Thanks. Martin Mucci : Good morning. Danyal Hussain : Just on the tax rate, I know Efrain you talked about this being very preliminary at this point, could you just walk us through where there are offset at this point, it's your understanding versus the federal rate decrease? So, like how you are losing for example the domestic production\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Yes. That's one. That's an important one. Danyal there is changes and deductibility of executive stock comp and then there is other deductions to which we avail ourselves. So, the combination of all of those will drive itself from the 21% range. Danyal Hussain : Got it. So, what is it that gets you, I guess from 10% to 12%, it's just an understanding of\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Yes. It's really is an understanding of the range. There is some complexity on a number of items in the bill that we are looking at. There also maybe some tax planning opportunities that we think we might be able to take advantage of and we are in that discussion. Danyal Hussain : Okay. And just to clarify, you said the low-end of the range, you are referring to that 10 to 12 -- build low end of the\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Yes. That's correct. Yes. I said if I had to peg it. I peg it at 10 around and 12. Danyal Hussain : Okay. And then, just a one follow-up, I know you offer caveat at this, but the reinvestment, could you just talk a bit about what mean to the sales product maybe incremental M&A and to the extent you can quantify this at all? Martin Mucci : Yes, Danyal. It's Marty. I think it's all of those. We are taking a look at the opportunities once we have a sense of the size of this. I mean there is some technology, what we are feeling good about the technology investments that we are making in the level that we are making. There are some things that are always there that we would like to accelerate. We would rather not mention those yet because we are kind of going through those and we want to talk to the Board about them as well in an upcoming meeting this quarter. But, it's a number of technology investments that could accelerate and we just think that it's a great opportunity to focus, it obviously take some to the bottom line, but also to take the opportunity to invest and sustaining long-term growth both top line and profitability. Danyal Hussain : Okay. Thank you very much. Martin Mucci : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Mr. James Berkley of Barclays. You may now proceed. James Berkley : Thanks. Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Just wanted to touch on -- did you see any potential impact from Hurricanes in the quarter, if you could size that potential -- size that if you could? And then, if you did see an impact, are you certain to see a rebound at all or somewhere to what you saw with Sandy? Efrain Rivera : You want to go ahead? Martin Mucci : We have seen I think there has been some not as big of a rebound as Sandy. But, I don't think particularly when you look at Florida; it wasn't quite as while it was widespread it wasn't quite as catastrophic damage. We are definitely seeing some small business improvement there coming back as you will see particularly what you would expect, roofers and contractors and things like that. I wouldn't say it's been significant yet, but I think it will be a small increase, but a longer period of time because it appears that the work is kind of go on for a while for the repair. So they are not as catastrophic, so you don't see a big huge change, but you see an increased number of small businesses in those areas of improvement. And then, I think they will probably hang around a little bit longer. I wouldn't say a significant or any, certainly not making any significant change to the results. Is there something you to want add Efrain? Efrain Rivera : No. It's just that, modest. James Berkley : Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up. Any detail around the size or timing of some of the synergies you guys are expecting or seeing, starting to see with HROI acquisition on both revenue and cost side would be helpful. Martin Mucci : Well, one thing we are seeing is, much faster than I think we have even expected by at least a quarter or so. The integration is going extremely well. The plan was to move -- to kind of combine -- a lot of the sales teams, not all of it, but a lot of the PEO sales teams across the country with HROI and we have got a very experienced sales and operations teams that we had in PEO and their leadership. And that seems to have really picked up the pace of the PEO at a great time for PEO sales anyway. And so, I wouldn't say we could quantify the benefit yet but it certainly right at the level that we expected and probably a little bit better from a sales and not a profit per se, but certainly integration of cost perspective both very positive in this first quarter with them. James Berkley : Okay. Thanks a lot. Martin Mucci : Okay. Efrain Rivera : Welcome. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mr. Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. You may now proceed. Jim Schneider : Good morning, Martin and Efrain. It's good to hear to you and I guess I wanted to start out maybe talking about the -- what you are seeing in terms of mid-market sentiments, clearly with ACA, uncertainty in calendar 2017 there was a lot of questions about that was kind of stalled decision-making which we talked about many times. Can you maybe talk about looking forward now that there appears to be the kind of repeal the individual mandate, whether you have seen any kind of improvement in terms of clarity of decision-making or increase decision-making in the mid-market segment? Martin Mucci : I think it's a little bit early, we are right in selling season now and while we feel there is some momentum out there. I think that mid-market is very competitive as it has been, no real change to that and the number of competitors or anything. I don't see at this stage a lot more decision-making. I think we are still kind of as we said we are kind of -- we had a lot of decisions made because of ACA and we certainly aren't seeing it back to that level and if anything, I think it's a little slower, because people made those decisions for a fully integrated HCM model that included payroll and insurances and everything else. So, we're feeling good about selling season for mid-market, but I wouldn't say it's any, nothing like a big pop in demand like we saw when there was ACA. And ACA I think still very confusing, while the individual mandate is lifted, there is still, it's not clear what the reporting requirements are going to be and in fact that they don't seem to be, they are not eliminated yet, a lot of reporting requirements that will have to be done. And so we're seeing good retention on our ACA products and some interest in new clients and still taking those products to be sure that they can monitor, record and track and report or we can report for them their insurance. Jim Schneider : Okay. Fair enough. And then, I guess if you look forward, you talked about reinvestment, you talked about I believe potential M&A as one aspect of that reinvest of the benefits from the tax reform. So if you may be just kind of update or refresh your thoughts on overall M&A beyond the kind of tuck-in you've done before, are you considering potentially something of bigger scale that would be little bit more transformative to the business or not? Martin Mucci : Well, I think that's always a possibility we're looking at a number of opportunities in M&A and there is a lot of opportunity out there. Valuations are still pretty high, so we're being very selective, I'm very proud of the fact that we've, while we've looked at 100s of opportunities over the years. We've picked very few and we've been very selective which have turned out to be very good like advance partners like HROI, just recently SurePayroll, et cetera. So, we're going to be very selective about what we pick, the good opportunities out there, I would say that, we look at this as an opportunity to possibly invest a little bit more. I would say transformational is always out there, but it has to be really something that we're comfortable with it, if that is to happen. Jim Schneider : Okay. Thank you. And happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Same to you. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Mr. David Togut, Evercore ISI. You may now proceed. David Togut : Thank you, good morning. Martin Mucci : Hi David. Efrain Rivera : Good morning. David Togut : You talked, Marty about the beginning of the critical year-end holiday selling seasons particularly the mid-market, but I'm wondering if you could broaden your comments to talk about the small business payroll outsourcing and HR services market. And in particular, does the passage of tax legislation particularly the reduction of the statutory tax rate impact the propensity of the small business owner to buy your services? Martin Mucci : Yes, it's obviously very early just passed, but I certainly think there is increased opportunity with anything whenever there is more complication and change, there is more opportunity for them to outsource right and say to go to someone. Look this is going to be a huge compliance workload in the next month to 45 days that makes take all the changes, the IRS getting through all this, everyone are understanding and getting back into forms and explaining it to clients. I think that's good for us, obviously could be, because the more complexity from that standpoint is not necessarily and typically complexity can stop new businesses from forming, I don't see that happening here in case and in fact some maybe encouraged as I think you are saying given the tax changes. And I think existing clients will find that the value of Paychex is really, they can really see even increased value of Paychex going through all of this change. So, I think there is some real opportunity there. From a selling season perspective overall, it's pretty early and you know we saw some momentum in November on the small business side, that we're hopeful we'll continue and we'll see, a lot of things are shifting. So, the go-to-market strategy that we put into effect which put more on the web, new changes in our website, putting adding chat to our website, making it easier for clients to search. Paychex understand what Paychex is and then buy either online or really buy, through telesales, it looks like it's really starting to pick up, but its early Dave, we'll have to kind of see, we need to get to the end of January to really see what the big impact is on the small business. HR, by the way HR services as we've noted and you've seen, growing very strong, very strong market for PEO retirement services and time and attendance for example, all growing well. David Togut : Understood, and then, I'm curious if you saw anything during ADP is proxified with Pershing Square particularly their greater disclosure about their innovation strategy with their new ended back-end payroll engine and tax filing engine, whether any of that disclosure impacts the way you think about your own innovation tax, particularly given the excess cash you'll have under the new tax bill? Martin Mucci : No I don't think so, I mean I think we've, they've ADP has always been a good competitor, I think we feel very comfortable with the technology investments that we've made in Flex and you know just introduced our new product bundles in October, our express product, payroll product on the low end. SurePayroll's investment, I think we feel good about the investments, but there is always some things that you'd like to do a little bit more in a quicker period of time and that's really from a technology side what we're reviewing is can we do that. It really hasn't, wouldn't haven't been influenced by ADP, they continue to be a good competitor and, and we feel very comfortable with competing against them. David Togut : Thanks and just a quick final one from me. As you contemplate use of proceeds from, the tax cut, you mentioned particularly higher R&D, but what about dividend payout. I mean you have a terrific payout ratio around 80%, should we expect accelerating dividend growth once the tax cuts come through and would the payout ratio stay at approximately the same level? Martin Mucci : Well I think, obviously that's a board decision, and so as we approach the next board meeting in the next month, that will be a good decision to have, I think the board has been very consistent with paying out a generous dividend, from when you look at others. But I think this, how big of a change that this is, I think they will continue to evaluate whether that's the proper level. But I don't have any doubt that we'll continue to be a leader in the way we pay out and it will be somewhat consistent certainly with what we've done in the past. David Togut : Understood, thanks and happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Thank you, same to you. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Mr. Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. You may now proceed Bryan Keane : Hi guys, just want to ask about payroll services growth, I think Marty or Efrain you suggested that the growth would be towards the low end of the range. Just trying to think a little bit about maybe the causes of that, I think you did mention client mix, so I just want to make sure I understand it? Efrain Rivera : I think, Bryan the two biggest impacts of that and then there is one additional factor that could impact it in the back-half of the year. But if I go through the first six months of the year, what you're seeing are the impacts are going from an average client size in the upper 16s to about 16 and we disclosed that. So, we get that drag in the first half of the year and that's impacting us. On the pricing side, we, our pricing range is about 2 to 4 and we're netting around in that 2% range. So the combination of those two is driving us to where we are in the back-half of the year the wildcard will be how strong the selling season is, so we have a strong selling season we could start to build up from that number. And we are anticipating and hoping that we will. Bryan Keane : So as client size gets smaller then you get the revenue yield is lower? Efrain Rivera : Yes, yes. Bryan Keane : Okay, and then just my question on the tax reform, so it sounds like some of that benefit then you are suggesting, might have reinvested so it would potentially go into investments which would lower margins, therefore we wouldn't see the full 100% impact to the bottom-line of the, I just want to make sure I got that correct? Efrain Rivera : Yes, let me just add some new ones to that Bryan. So, the concept here is not that we simply reinvest and up the amount of expenses we have in the business. The idea is that we reinvest over a period of time over the next couple of years say, and that those investments pay out in future growth of the company in two forms. Number one, top-line growth, and number two could be earnings growth by becoming more effective and more efficient. So that's our thought process here, now that we think the current rate of spend needs to be upped and we have an opportunity, but instead that we have as Marty suggested earlier, the opportunity to take a look at a range of different projects both on the operation side and on the technology side to see if we can accelerate them. And if they were on a roadmap let's say it was three to four years could we do that into and can we start to pull some of those projects forward and we have a robust list of things that we are looking at. Bryan Keane : Okay, very helpful. Happy holidays guys. Martin Mucci : Same to you. Efrain Rivera : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And for the next question is from the line of Mr. Gary Bisbee of RBC Capital Markets. You may now proceed. Gary Bisbee : I'll start by following up on this client mix shift. So in your, your 10-K for fiscal 2017 you said total clients, payroll clients I guess that it was flatted 605,000, so if the mix is, does this mean the mid-market clients or larger clients actually declined, but it was offset by growth in small clients? Martin Mucci : Well, I mean, no, Gary, I think that the growth that we saw was on the lower end of our client base. We didn't see declines in the mid-market in the terms of number of clients. But as a percentage of the client base, because the rest of the client base shifted down to lower size clients. We've been seeing over the less, I would say certainly last couple of years more growth on the low end of the client base than on the higher end of the client base. Gary Bisbee : And so, let me ask you about that metric, that 605,000 and I know that's rounded and everything else right, but the number u put in the 10-K every year is that just payroll and so is the number bigger if you have some segment that are doing HRS but not buying payroll or is that practice? Efrain Rivera : No that includes clients that run payroll. So, that would capture, so some of those clients have additional ancillaries, but we count them if they run payroll less payroll clients. Gary Bisbee : Yes, right, okay, all right. And so, I guess the next question then, continuing on the theme, so you've talked about the new bundles and the simpler pricing and adding some things there, I know its early, but what's the, how is that being received in the market as you people are out ahead of the key selling season, is that helping competitively or is that, are there any feedback you have at this point? Martin Mucci : Yes, Gary. It's positive feedback from a couple of different standpoints one is the bundles being a little more competitive by adding things that others competitors don't have, like paperless onboarding, the two mid-level bundles have paperless onboarding and there is new do-it-yourself handbook, we've always had a handbook product, but we is very expensive and so we give information to the client that we work with them, kind of personally over the phone or in person to put that together. We found that the new do-it-yourself online handbook that is a little simpler and its more self-directed by the client is getting very good feedback in that bundle. So, and then express on the low end is getting good feedback. So far its good feedback, it's early in selling season you really can't see it until January, particularly in small business and it's harder to predict. But we're doing positive feedback on it from what's in the bundle we think we kind of hit it right. So, we'll see how the selling season comes out. Gary Bisbee : Okay, great. And then just the final one from me, each of you said in your remarks, alluded to PEO being poised for PEO and ASO maybe it was being poised for some acceleration over time and was that comment aimed at the comment you made about integrating the sales force HROI with your own and that going well or where there some other reason that you are optimistic about the positioning of the combined business there? Martin Mucci : I think both, one the integration is going very well, so we added good leadership at HROI and there experienced with a very experienced team on the Paychex side across the country. So I think that's been very, that's been positive and I think is helping the growth in PEO. But overall I would say there right now PEO is, really is doing well, HR outsourcing in general, but PEO is doing well. I think it's just because of all the changing regulations, and it's been very positive from that standpoint. When you think about it, if you just take just think about minimum wage changes and how many are in different states, what we're finding and I have mentioned this before, what these businesses are going through now is even before tax reform changes was the fact that well federal regulations are trying to be reduced and are being reduced to some degree, state regulations are making it even more complex if you are multi-state employer. Different minimum wage changes, Paid Family Leave Act is different in New York than New Jersey different from other states. And now, lot of rules are even coming out and scheduling employees. And so, I think it's just that a shared employer is getting a lot of attention right now. Gary Bisbee : That makes sense. Thanks. Happy holidays and Merry Christmas. Martin Mucci : Thank you, same to you. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Mr. Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. You may now proceed. Kartik Mehta : Hey, good morning, Marty and Efrain. Martin Mucci : Hi, Kartik. Kartik Mehta : Marty as you looked at the selling season and you kind of compared to what you've seen in the last couple of years and the changes that are going on maybe more people going to the internet to look for payroll. Is that at all changed in how you are managing the sales process and what you are investing in and ultimately could some of the investments you are talking about as a result of tax reform would be related to that? Martin Mucci : Well certainly and you know we've already started those investments, Kartik we talked about how we really up the investment in digital marketing and in getting more leads we've invested in the website. We've now rolled out chat different forms of live chat on the website, because definitely what you are saying, small business micro in particular let's say less than five employees, there is 60% of the way through the sales process just in the search online by themselves and they are ready to buy. So the change that we made beginning of this fiscal year, where we added more sales reps and the virtual teams or telesales, has really started to pay off. And we're learning and tweaking on the leads and how to get more leads and how to do that and how to do in the most efficient way. But that certainly could be part of the investment. Now if you go back to what Efrain said though on top there to be clear, this is not just about saying okay we're going to raise the level of ongoing expense, but we're looking for some, is there some technology investments that could be made over the next, this fiscal, next fiscal, that while you're getting the biggest benefit of tax reform that we could accelerate those investments to maybe speed that up. So, no more feeling pretty good, selling season again, I won't comment, because it's too early particularly for small business, but I were very bullish on how the virtual sales is going to take off. The field that also gets very focused on, kind of the five plus and larger clients and has more time for that in the, when clients want to call in and buy telesales is ready to do it. Kartik Mehta : And Marty, in the past I know you focus on acquiring companies there may be private and bolting on those companies, as you look at this tax reform do you think there is any change in evaluation, I know evaluations kind of kept you on the sidelines, but do you think there is any change in evaluation, because of the tax reform, could that have any impact on what you look at or what happens to evaluations? Martin Mucci : I suppose it depends certainly on the company and their profitability, right if its, if many of these companies at least if they are depending on their size and profitability whether the tax reform will even impact them or not or whether they have carry losses and forwards and things like that. So, I think it could have some impact, I don't think we're seeing that right now, but that certainly would measure into things that we're looking at. Efrain Rivera : I think the other thing I would add Kartik, the inability to deduct interest expense above certain caps makes certain targets more attractive than they otherwise would be at the margin. Now I just want to caveat that I'm not saying that we have a target in mind, but that those opportunities will be there, it's not a great place to be if you have a significant amount of that in your capital structure and companies like Paychex that don't operate that way can bring value in those situation. So, I would say at the margin those opportunities will be more attractive. Kartik Mehta : And then Efrain just one last question, the interest on clients' funds does the rate change and/or the tax reform change at all, how you will invest these funds? Efrain Rivera : Yes it actually, it actually could have an impact. So, I was reticent or we were reticent, we had a discussion internally about attempting the modified guidance with all of these changes going on. But, it's certainly could impact the composition of the portfolio which in turn could impact the effective tax rate. And the point I'm making is that, you may end up in a world where corporates are more, corporate taxable bonds or more favorable investment vehicles which would drive your effective tax rate up, but won't have much with a change in the bottom-line and we're looking at the composition of the portfolio to understand if it makes sense over time to change the shift from almost all municipals and some corporates to more corporates and fewer municipals. So, that's all part of the raft of considerations that we need to think about. Kartik Mehta : All right, thank you, Marty and Efrain. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Thanks Kartik. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Mr. Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. You may now proceed. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Hi Ashwin. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Good morning, Martin. Good morning, Efrain. I wanted to go once more to sort of the derivative impact of tax reform, now you addressed the propensity to outsource might go up because these are complex. But what are your SME clients saying to you about potential higher employment and things like that. Can that down the road effect, that client makes metric that's hurting payroll process? Martin Mucci : Frankly, Ashwin, at this point they are not saying anything, because I think they are still trying to figure it all out. But I think that, they will certainly, if to the degree that a small business, gains or benefit on tax reform, they some, many in small businesses aren't that profitable, so they might not, pick up that much gain. But they will certainly I think the overall feeling is, hey they will have an opportunity to invest in their business hire more people and they will do it that way. So that they can expand, so that's certainly should be another positive opportunity for us to, even existing clients be able to add more employees which will help us with more checks. And they may now say okay, I can spend on a 401(k) and make a contribution. So I'll take a 401(k) and we're looking at all of our marketing to our clients and prospects to say, you may, this may be the time that you want to invest in health insurance, invest in 401(k) retirement plans or IROA, or something else that Paychex can provide to you and make it easy form as they see their benefit. Efrain Rivera : And so the other thing Ashwin to build on what Marty says, our thinking as we go through, go forward is that, the tilt will be in the future towards comprehensive outsourcing solutions. So, bundling benefits, bundling other ancillaries that if there was a trend to do that in the past there is more and we think we have made, we have shown by our investment dollars that we think the PEOs going to be a beneficiary. But to Marty's point, we think there is going to be other areas of the business on the ancillary side that will benefit from more available cash in the hands of small business owner, small, medium size business owners. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Understood. And is it for the near-term possible to quantify or have you put in your forward expectations here. So the strength of any one-time reporting noted if there is complexity in the next one to two quarters? Efrain Rivera : I think it's early and I think where you would see and where it would be easier to do is really on the PEO side more than anything else. But, I think we're early in the process to see what's going on. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. One more along those lines, lower withholding because of this less effective investment plan? Efrain Rivera : So, the impact we think will be between $200 million to $300 million on client funds, at the margin we think that's about a penny EPS going forward, I'm sorry on an annualized basis; I don't want to close an estimate revision at this point. This is yet another kind of guessed earlier about the portfolio, client funds will decline as a result of this, it's a modest impact given the portfolio, but it will have an impact on where we're rolling through all of those impacts to be able to speak with more certainty as we go forward. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. And one question not related to any of these, cash flow for the last six months been quite good, how much of that is timing and what's sustainable for the course of the year and if you could kind of\u2026 Efrain Rivera : No, I think 26 was high, I don't have an exact percentage obviously 26 through the first half of the year, there were some unique items that occurred we had fourth quarter was artificially low and the per six months are probably a little artificially high. But we, I think double-digit certainly is where we're going, I think, I just add one other point on that, our cash generation has been tremendously strong. So, we continue to deliver high quality earnings. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Got it. Thanks. And happy holidays both of you. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Same to you. Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Ashwin. You too. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Mr. Rick Eskelsen of Wells Fargo. You may now proceed. Rick Eskelsen : Hi, good morning, Marty, how are you. Thank you for taking my question. Just the first one again following on the tax reform theme. You guys are talking about reinvesting, I assume some of your competitors would probably look at similar things, so in terms of overall market competition or in what you see, what impact do you think you could see from tax reform on the competitiveness of the market? Efrain Rivera : Well, I'd say this Rick, and then Marty can also build up on it. Hey if you got more in your award chest you are in a better position. So, I would say those who have in the award chest or in a better position to be able to compete in a landscape where resources matter. So, I would say we're that's one reason why as we looked at the opportunity we said there are, there are opportunities to accelerate some high value projects and opportunities and this is the time to start thinking about doing that over the next couple of years. Martin Mucci : Yes, I think you know as Efrain said, it's an interesting point when you think about there is companies that are going to gain from this, in our competitive environment and there is others that won't because, they don't have the profitability and the tax reduction that we're going to have and we will be able to invest more where others aren't going to gain that much. So, I think it will continue to put companies who are already profitable and who have been paying a high tax and now will pay lower that should help us to be, if we plan this right and invest correctly, this will make us even more competitive than we are today with some others who can't do the same level of increased investment. Rick Eskelsen : Thanks, that's helpful. And just sort of building on that a little bit, two questions on the CapEx, I know this is a little bit higher this quarter, I think based on your disclosure due to the campus build out. So I guess the question\u2026 Martin Mucci : Yes, look on the presentation we posted on the website it's a, CapEx it can be, I think we said 180 to 190 for the year, I think it's going to be come in a little bit lower, you can see what we spent in the quarter on the campus, one thing I would, I think it's very important to emphasize, I keep saying this the build out on the campus permits us to consolidate leases and save expenses on an operating basis going forward. So that's why we did not, no reason other than that. It gets efficiencies, but I should say from a financial standpoint, it was a very attractive deal for us. Rick Eskelsen : And is that primarily the campus build out, is that primarily going to happen this year and then thinking about CapEx and the investments you guys have talked about, how should we think about, some of those investments being, the technology and CapEx side moving forward? Efrain Rivera : Yes, so it's primarily this year Rick. So, we may have some spill over capital into next year, but most of it occurs this year. Rick Eskelsen : And the longer term, I mean is there what you're accelerating from investments should we look for that CapEx number to maybe dripped up slightly in the next coming year? Efrain Rivera : It could, so if you look at what we've been standing we're in that, call it 3.5% of revenue range somewhere in that sometimes we bounce up a little bit higher to closer to 4%. You know that's sort of our normalized CapEx, I'm sorry, capital expense amount. We could bounce a little higher, if we saw projects that made sense. It's not going to - I wouldn't anticipate at this point that it would bounce up to the level that we're spending this year, because of the building. Rick Eskelsen : Great. Thank you very much. Happy holidays. Efrain Rivera : Thanks. You too. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Mr. Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may now proceed. Jason Kupferberg : Great. How are you guys doing? Martin Mucci : Good. Thanks. Jason Kupferberg : Good, good. So, just one more on tax, I just wanted to push a little bit on the reinvestments, I know it's premature to have kind of precise numbers, and as far as how much you may reinvest. But can you just, maybe roughly dimension it for us, I mean we're talking about, 10% of the benefit 40%, just some rough order of magnitude to give investors a sense of how you guys are thinking about the reinvestment opportunities? Efrain Rivera : So here is our precise, about as precise that could be, I would say its half or less. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. I'll take it. Thanks. Efrain Rivera : But the reason why, I don't mean to be flipping and that wasn't a flipped commented it actually is a serious comment. The process when you are doing this, is that you collect a lot of opportunities and Marty will sit down and management team will sit down and say what do we think are the things that really move the needle, as oppose to or just opportunities to spend and give us a bit of an incremental bump. And then we are going to go through a conversation at the board level to discuss what their comfort level is and then we're going to look at it all together and does it make sense, but from both and investor standpoint and from a business standpoint. And so, we're in any one and a half to two of that process it will accelerate certainly over the next month or so, but it is a little bit early. We know the opportunities there, we certainly would drop all of it into the opportunities, but we think we do have opportunities to spend and we're going to rank order them and then do that. Jason Kupferberg : All right. So you think by the time to the next earnings call we'll have. Efrain Rivera : Oh, yes. Definitely, yes. Jason Kupferberg : Yes, okay, okay great. I don't think I heard much just about kind of bookings and retention in the quarter, I mean these qualitatively and I know you don't give hard numbers, but you are facing some easier comparisons, I know you are targeting for bookings to be positive on a full year-over-year basis for 2018 that still on track and are you seeing further up ticks in retention post the implementation of a new client service model. Martin Mucci : I think retention has been very consistent through the year, so I think that's been positive, it's near all time highs that we had and we are rebounding back from last year where we dropped of just a little bit. So, I think it's been pretty consistent, pretty positive there. And again, we will have a good -- the best sense after January and certainly the same for sales. We don't normally Jason talk about it, until after we get through the selling season. But, we had some momentum in November and so it's always hard to tell exactly but we are feeling pretty good about it. And we will see how we come out with the new bundles for the service model changed with the sales, go to market stuff that we have done with the virtual team inside and the increase in web investment. We are feeling good, it's just early in, little tough to talk about until we know. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. And just a last one on core payroll, I guess we have a slight tweak here to the low-end of 1% to 2% for the year. So, I guess what around the edges kind of changed in your guys mind over the last three months. Because it doesn't sound like the hurricane impacts were any worse than you'd feared and I think we had talked about the smaller client sizes last quarter. But, just wanted to see if there was anything discernible that led you to the lower end? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Jason, I think the thing that beyond the things that I mentioned, the speed and the pace of ramp always impacts payroll revenue growth. And so, we tweaked it based on what we are seeing in terms of the pace of the ramp through the year. That I think it's our -- the reason we tweaked at this point. Jason Kupferberg : Just a ramp of the metrics itself, you mean like in other words, now you are taking a truck point halfway through the year and just feel like the low end is more likely? Okay. Got it. All right. Have a great holiday. Thanks. Martin Mucci : Thanks. Efrain Rivera : Thanks. You too. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Mr. Tim McHugh of William Blair Company. You may now proceed. Tim McHugh : Yes. Thanks. Just a follow-up on the comments you referenced I guess once or twice on November, is that related to macro data or your -- I guess company's specific comment, and if it's company specific, can you elaborate on what the momentum was that you are referring to that that makes you feel better? Martin Mucci : I mean just generally you are starting to head into that selling season. And it, we had some momentum there. That was specific to us, Tim. So, not in the macro sense but more specific to us. Just as you getting into this year end time, we felt pretty good about. The first part of the quarter was okay, it was kind of like, I'm sorry, first part of the second quarter, it was kind of like the first quarter. And then, November, seem to had a little bit of an up tick. But, it doesn't make the selling season. So, we hate the comment much more than that, just that if you are pretty good empirically, if you look at the HRS side of it, we certainly saw a nice up tick in the PEO side. So, I think we are feeling pretty -- I'm feeling pretty positive coming out of November. But, again, I could tell you a lot more after this next quarter. Tim McHugh : Okay. One other question, just HROI, I guess when I do the math on the revenue and contribution and the expense impacted it, looks like it was breakeven even maybe slightly worse than that? Efrain Rivera : It was modestly negative Tim, but, really not a significant impact. Tim McHugh : Can you -- why, was that integration expense or\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Deal, you always have integration cost. So there is the -- when we do a deal, we are assuming that we got to do a number of investments. And then, there is the amortization associated with the deal itself that had expense and that starts to lessen as the quarter grow -- as we go through the quarter. Tim McHugh : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Mr. David Grossman of Stifel Financial. You may now proceed. David Grossman : Thank you. Good morning. I wonder, if I can just go back to the unit growth question that has been coming up in terms of and the impact of mix on that number. I mean, my recollection is that a typical economic cycle is that, is it mature as you have the tendency to be adding new business creations improves and our mix naturally skews to smaller companies or smaller clients than the average. And so that's a natural phenomenon, so in fact that pressuring perhaps payroll growth for the low? And are there other dynamics maybe that are really have work that really are driving that number down, because typically you will get volume in terms of total units that were offset that decline. And I'm just wondering is this cycle different or is it anything else going on in the business that maybe impacting the growth of that number? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I think it really boils down, you could kind of summarize it by saying last year we didn't have a fine growth. We talked a bit about why that was at the end of the year and a lot of that related to service disruptions and the spike and retention, I'm sorry, spike and attrition that we had, we dropped by a point. When you put that together with the result -- the sales results and the mix shift that we are seeing you are driving client -- I'm sorry, you are driving payroll service revenue to the rate that we are experiencing. So, I think was a little idiosyncratic now is that we are anniversarying some of that retention issue that we had last year and it's driving payroll service revenue down. David Grossman : Right. So, I guess this question was asked in a different context, so then the difference if we knew about the retention and the headwind that we would have going into this year, is the difference primarily related to a pricing dynamic or what is it that specifically is\u2026 Efrain Rivera : It's not a pricing dynamic. I would say at the margin pricing is a little bit more competitive in small market payroll under 50 than it was last year. So, we are realizing about 2%. But, again, I'm comparing against growth against last year, where I experienced -- started to experience some of the defects in the back half of that year. So the front half is a little more challenge than the back half will be. David Grossman : I got it. Okay. And then, the second question I had relates to the PEO, when you back out the distortion from HROI, can you give us a sense of at least organically what work side employees, how that growth is trending? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I don't know that I've got the exact number. We haven't disclosed it. But, I would say this David, it's pretty solid, it can certainly -- upper single digits, maybe double digits, I have to go back. But, I would say that's the range, I won't be more specific than that. But, I would say that's the range, I won't be more specific than that. But, I think the point if I can think about the point beyond your question, we have had obviously very good work side employee growth. But, its not all because of HROI, we think have work side employee growth on our PEO also. Martin Mucci : Yes. It's been pretty consistent. We went over a million work side employees that we serve and that was -- that's without that was before HROI. So, I think that numbers are in that range. That's the range. David Grossman : And any thoughts on just at a high level how [indiscernible] are impacting revenues this year, is there any noticeable difference in terms of insurance past service and how that maybe impacting revenue growth? Efrain Rivera : Not really David. I think there is a little bit more impact, by the way, I just looked it up, so the best that I will say, our organic work side play growth was double-digit. So we are seeing nice performance, Marty alluded to that. I didn't have the numbers in front of me, I looked it up. So, past service are not -- that past, I should say that, there is at the margin more pass through because of the addition of HROI. It's not significantly distorting the growth numbers. I would say as the percentage of business that we are deriving from PEO growth, you will see more. One of the thing I would say because -- advice as to whether we report it more regularly through that every single year, it's been 10k pass through. So, we look at whether we had that disclosure. David Grossman : Right. And then, just one last thing on the PEO. You made this acquisition, I don't remember what your historical exposure was to blue-gray segment. So, yes, just curious, you made this acquisition, how do you see the market evolving over the next couple of years, vis-\u00e0-vis [indiscernible] historical perspective was, let's say two or three years prior to this. Martin Mucci : You mean, in general for the PEO, I think we are stilling looking at it consistently as we've always had. That's one of the things we liked about HROI. They were very consistent from a way they went after clients selected clients. We had a very good way to compliance wave there to look at it in underwriting and I think they were very consistent with that as well. So, I don't think we are increasing risk as we take on these PEOs as we taken on a company like HROI, because they are very consistent with the way we looked at it. And I don't see us getting more risky we don't see it that way. We have always been pretty careful on that and actually had a very strong PEO because of that we have to grow without taking and really additional risk over the parameters that we have always had in the past. Efrain Rivera : We think that segment in the market David also continued to grow. And particularly growth in areas where HROI is strong and we are strong. David Grossman : Right. Okay, guys. Thanks very much. Have a great holiday. Martin Mucci : Thank you too. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Mr. Mark Marcon of Baird. You may now proceed sir. Mark Marcon : Hey, Marty and Efrain. Martin Mucci : Hey, Mark. Mark Marcon : With regards to HROI, was the contribution in this past quarter, somewhere around $20 million? Efrain Rivera : I think you can derive that, Mark. It's in that range. Mark Marcon : Okay. And then, with regards to the effective yield for the back off of this year, just given with the recent rate, increase, how should we think about that in terms of -- think about the flow balance coming down by 200 to 300\u2026. Efrain Rivera : All in the back half of the year, Mark. I just cautioned you to -- Mark Marcon : Yes. I know with the duration and everything. That's why I was asking the question. Efrain Rivera : So, I think we still feel comfortable with the guidance that we've given. So, that's where we peg it at. The reason why I'm not, I can't more specific in that that market, we are looking at the composition of portfolio and over the next three, four, five months it could change. So, but we are comfortable with where we are right. Mark Marcon : Okay. And then, with regards to -- this small business formation, there has been a lot of discussion about just the way pass throughs are going to work, don't you think that there is going to ultimately end being a little bit more in terms of small business formations that could end up occurring because of this change in and this so, how would you take advantage of that? Martin Mucci : Well, I think -- I do think that you would expect that given the reform that you are seeing in that would drive some of that. We obviously, haven't seen it yet. But, you certainly get that feeling that will happen. We would take advantage of it by being out there and marketing to the fact that, if you are going to incorporate it as a small business for the first time in particular, you would best have someone like Paychex there to support you. So, I would think we are already looking at how can marketing take advantage of anything that comes out of tax reform and that is certainly one of them. Mark Marcon : Great. And then, just with regards to the capital expensing provisions and the ability to deduct all of that related to over the next five years. To what extent, would you end up really taking advantage of that, I mean could you -- do you have other ways to take advantage of it to a greater extent than just marginally increasing your CapEx? Efrain Rivera : There maybe Mark. And I would just say its early in the process, so we are going to take a look at that. Mark Marcon : Okay. And then, in terms of just very short-term one-time impact, to what extent are you going to have to spend more in a very short-term just to get the systems into compliance. It sounds like the IRS is basically not going to give the new withholding tables until February, so you are going to have to -- it's going to be a bit of a scramble here in terms of calendar Q1? Martin Mucci : No. I don't think, we are ready, we are dealing working with the IRS almost daily on what's happening in and how we will be able to support them and that's the strength of a company of our size and our compliance team and tax team that they are ready -- they know it's going to be a scramble, they are expecting it. And we work very closely with the IRS to help them and work with them, so that everything is up and running as quickly as possible. I don't think it's not going to cost us additional expense in the quarter or something like that. I mean, truly there is going to be a lot of extra work, but our teams will be ready to do it. I don't see a big -- any big investment or change because of it. Mark Marcon : Okay, great. And anything to think about with regards to your deferred income tax liability? Efrain Rivera : Yes. There will be a reval, we will and it will produce a benefit, looking through that. Mark Marcon : Yes. Okay. I mean obviously everybody will know to look through it but I just brought it up just\u2026 Efrain Rivera : No. I know. I appreciate it, Mark. But, yes, we are not ready to quantify it yet. But there will be some benefit one-time. Mark Marcon : Okay, great. Happy, happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Same to you Mark. Mark Marcon : All right. Take care. Efrain Rivera : Bye-bye. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO. You may now proceed. Henry Chien : Hey, good morning, Marty and Efrain. Efrain Rivera : Hey, Jeff. Henry Chien : Hey, it is actually Henry Chien. Efrain Rivera : Oh, Henry, sorry. Henry Chien : Hey, guys. Thanks for speaking to me. Just I wanted to ask a more high level just competitive kind of positioning question. There does seem to be a ton of investment going into the HR services and HR bundles from both ADP and software providers. I was just wondering if you could share any updated thoughts on how Paychex is doing this season in terms of HR sales and where Paychex is doing better or just how you are thinking about positioning in general? Thanks. Martin Mucci : I think -- Henry, I think the -- competitive environment is pretty much the same, everybody is investing, we feel very good about the investments we have made, in fact, we've really taken it to -- we have taken our entire development team really a year or more ago over to really agile teams. We develop and roll out changes much faster now. We rolled up to new bundles in October that include, so it's not just payroll bundles, they are bundles with HR components to them like paperless handboarding for our clients, so that you can basically recruit, post recruit, hire bring them on up in a paperless fashion in part of one of our bundles that they can buy or do it yourself handbook because we found instead of the more complicated handbook and more thorough handbook that needs personal interaction, more clients want to do it themselves and have a scale down, when they can complete at their own pace, and when they want to do it. And all that innovation has been quick and rolls and rolls out very successfully. And we haven't even talked on the call at all about mobile. Our mobile adoption and the use of our mobile app has picked up dramatically and it's been by -- more by the employees of the clients versus the employer. So, these innovations have been very good. We see tax reforms and opportunities, we have said a number of times to possibly accelerate a few things that are on the outskirts of what we wanted to do and bring them forward a little bit. But, we are very comfortable with our level of innovation and competitiveness in the market. And I don't -- I think it's been pretty consistent. We expect, you got to innovate, you got to have a great service, you got to deliver and I think Paychex and our folks are doing that. Henry Chien : Got it. Okay. That's great. And just in terms of the kind of macro environment, it sounded like that the smaller client sizes, it's a number of I guess business formations has been picking up from your view. Is that sort of a normal kind of pattern that you've seen from your experience over cycles and is there anything that we should watch out for, that you are watching for to just to be careful in terms of the macro environment? Martin Mucci : I don't -- we haven't talked too much about formation itself. But, it's kind of flattened out, it's kind of back to the levels, pretty close to the levels that it was in the previous session. I think the big thing on this after this recession was how long it took. It didn't pop right back. It took a lot longer. But, it was sustained longer. The thing I mentioned earlier is, on our monthly employment report, what we are seeing is that job growth -- the small business job growth under 50 employees has moderated, but there is still job growth and consistent job growth. But, it moderated down as you would expect as we are around full employment. But, the wage increases are now picking up and part of that is scarcity of the resource because of full employment. So the wage increases are now getting up from that 2% and getting closer to 3% and running around 2.8% or so. And I think, so you are seeing pretty good wage increase, and then, you are seeing the moderate small business job growth that's all pretty positive. The thing to look out for maybe what was mentioned couple of questions ago, which is with the pass throughs and the tax reform, does that generate new business formation for someone who was not going to formulate a business before now it may make sense for them. We may see a pick-up in that just a little bit early to tell. Henry Chien : Okay. Thanks so much for the color. Martin Mucci : Okay. Efrain Rivera : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question is from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. You may now proceed. Tien- tsin Huang : Real quick. Just on the -- I wanted to clarify on the pricing side, just with all the bundling and pricing and simplification, any change in pricing in the quarter and sort of your outlook, I didn't think so, but just wanted to make sure. Martin Mucci : No. Really the product, the bundles were more since you are combining the features, making the pricing simpler in a way that we present it to the client. We don't see that is changing the revenue per client or what we are getting from in price. We haven't seen it yet. It's early, but didn't expect it, and haven't seen it yet. Tien- tsin Huang : All right. That's great. Thank you. Have a safe holiday. Martin Mucci : Great. Thanks. You too. Efrain Rivera : Bye-bye Martin Mucci : Anymore calls operator? Operator : I'm sorry, sir. At this time, there are no further questions on queue. Martin Mucci : Great. At this point we will close the call. If you are interesting in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for about 30 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in the second quarter press release conference call and your interest in Paychex. We appreciate it. Please have a great holiday. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. For the presentation, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect from the conference. Now I\u2019ll turn the meeting over to your host Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may now begin. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of Paychex\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2018. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days and you can access our earnings release and Form 10-Q on our Investor Relations webpage. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on the website for approximately one month.  On today\u2019s call, I will review business highlights for the third quarter and Efrain will review our third quarter financial results and discuss our full year guidance. And then we\u2019ll open it up to any questions. We were pleased with our results for the third quarter as we continued to deliver solid performance across our major HCM product lines. Our total revenue growth was 9% aided by our acquisition of HROI, this is the highest revenue growth in our past six fiscal quarters.  In addition, to HROI organic HR into our outsourcing services, retirement services and insurance services all performed very well in the quarter. And March 1, 2018, we announced the acquisition of lesser group and market leading provider of payroll and HCM software solutions headquartered in Denmark and serving clients in Northern Europe. We believe the combination of Lessor\u2019s payroll and HCM software products with our full service business process outsourcing capabilities will provide a complete technology-enabled services platform in the markets that they serve and we\u2019ll expand too.  The Lessor\u2019s group is a good strategic fit for the following reasons. First, the vast majority of which clients across four countries don our target small business market. Lessor has a solid and scalable proprietary intellectual property with experience technology development talent. They have a season management team, they are profitable and reflect study growth with the ability to fund further growth and development. We can leverage Lessor to support our growth in Germany, where we\u2019ve been for the past 10 years and provide an enhanced technology solution going forward there. And this acquisition offers us the opportunity to expand our market penetration in countries Lessor serves as well as other European countries in the future. We are pleased to welcome the employees of Lesser Group to the Paychex\u2019s family and while our international operations are currently small in relation to the company as a whole, we are excited by the opportunities this acquisition provides us for further expansion and growth.  We have seen increased momentum in our sales execution as the year has progressed, in third quarter sales to new businesses were up approximately 7% compared to last year's third quarter. During our third quarter selling season in the small into the market less than ten employees, our sales teams have done very well. The mid-market up 20 plus to 500 or so, has seen an increase in the competitive intensity. However, our comprehensive HR Outsourcing services both PEO and ASO which we consider part of the mid-market performed well in both sales and client retention. HROI acquired in August has been tracking ahead of our plan. Overall despite a slow start to the year we have exited our selling season with momentum.  The labor market show signs of tightening as evidenced by our Paychex\u2019s IHS, market small business employment watch, the growth in jobs is stabilizing because of challenges in finding qualified employees and we expect this will result in business owners making positive changes to wages and benefits as they compete for top talent. We've seen a 12-month growth in hourly earnings of about 2.7%. The combination of this level of wage growth and consistent small business job growth are indicators of a healthy small business sector. We believe these promising indicators will continue to create opportunities for new sales in the small business market. On December 21, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or tax reform was enacted and it\u2019s the most comprehensive tax reform legislation in more than two decades. Paychex is a corporate taxpayer, it\u2019s a significant beneficiary of tax reform. Efrain will discuss the financial impacts in more detail, however, I want to mention that as a result of the significant income tax reduction, we plan to utilize some of this opportunistic benefit to make various investments in our business. These investments include accelerating certain technology projects for the continued evolution of our customer experience, increasing our spend in marketing demand generation and sales and service strategy enhancement as well as investment in our employees. These accelerated investments will help drive future returns for our shareholders.  As it pertains to our clients, we are already helping them navigate the new tax code. Our systems were updated with the new tax rates within hours of their release and we provide many resources to our clients from online educational content to our dedicated service center with experienced payrolls specialists and onsite HR support. We are committed to delivering best in class technology solutions for our clients and business partners and our HCM solutions have continued to gain acceptance as shown by recent recognition we have received and I'd like to mention a few of those.  We were recognized as a leader in the 2018 NelsonHall Evaluation and Assessment Tool or NEAT for payroll services for the second year in a row. We received this recognition for the overall depth of the payroll delivery capability and a robust user experience which is enabled through our Paychex Flex cloud platform.  In addition to this overall distinction, we also were placed in the leader quadrant for technology and user experience, analytics and reporting and our HR cloud integration. We are proud that our Flex platform has once again been recognized as an innovative and powerful tool that enables our clients to gain productivity and focus and growing their businesses. Business News Daily on our Paychex by saying that the Paychex PEO offering is the best in the industry for mid-sized businesses. This was based on our unmatched breadth of services along with choice, flexibility and scalability we offer clients in several areas. The hands-on support we provide our clients through our experienced HR generalists is a differentiator for us in the market. We're pleased that this media outlet recognized the culture of service that exists here at Paychex.  On March 1st we announced for the second consecutive year that the American Business Awards honored Paychex with a bronze medal for customer service department of the year as part of its Stevie Awards Program. The Stevie Awards are considered among the nation's top liners for sales and customer service. This award reflects the dedication of our service givers and the responsiveness, reliability and knowledge that help us provide world-class service to our clients.  We also were honored to earn a Silver Alexander Hamilton Award for excellence in operational risk management and insurance. We earned this recognition for our authentication and financial crime prevention initiative which works to help protect our clients from fraud activities in the digital age. We're also proud to be named to the 2018 world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere Institute our 10th consecutive year receiving this honor. Integrity is one of our company's most important values permeating our culture. Receiving this honor underscores our commitment to leading with integrity and prioritizing ethical business practices.  Learning and development is a founding principle of Paychex and our learning and development center has again been recognized by Training Magazine as one of the top 125 training organizations for the 17th consecutive year, and we jumped six spots this year to number 14.  We're also pleased to be selected by the International Franchise Association the world's oldest and largest organization representing franchising worldwide as its preferred payroll solutions provider for its IFA membership. IFA based its decision on metrics involving service model, client retention, pricing and franchise experience. We continuously also look to enhance the value of our portfolio and products to our clients. Recently, we announced that we will offer net spends, tip network to help clients in the restaurant industry manage what is an administrative challenge unique to their industry. In conjunction with Paycard, tip network allows restaurants to track employees' tips, calculate tip sharing and pooling amount and distributes tips electronically at the end of a shift.  I'm very proud of what our 14,000 employees have accomplished with their hard work and effort every day for our clients. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the third quarter. Efrain. Efrain Rivera : Thanks Marty, good morning to all of you, I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference will contain certain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such involve risks. Please refer to the customary disclosures, in addition I will sometimes refer to non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These measurements include certain discrete items and one-time charges. Please refer to our press release and also refer to our investor slide presentation which breaks it all out for a discussion of these measures and a reconciliation for the third quarter and nine months of fiscal 2018 to the related GAAP measures. I'm going to cover a few things today in addition to talking about the third quarter I'll give some discussion about the fourth quarter full year and then a peek ahead into 2019.  So, I'll highlight that as we go along. Let me start by the providing the key highlights for the quarter, total revenues just over 9% to 866 million approximately 3% of the growth was attributable to HROI, as Marty mentioned they are performing ahead of where we had expected at this stage. Expenses increased 17% for the third quarter, the growth rate was significantly impacted by a few items of note, these include the following.  The acquisition of HROI that contributed 5% for expense growth for the third quarter. Very importantly, a one-time charge that we recorded following the termination of certain licensing agreements that we had. This contributed approximately 7% of total expense growth, just please note that it\u2019s a one-time charge we decided that it\u2019s the right time to exit those licensing agreements.  Our investment employees by a one-time bonus to non-management employees during the third quarter contributed approximately 2% total expense growth for the quarter. We didn\u2019t call that out as a one-time charge technically it is not. But we increased spending obviously wanted to allow employees to share in the benefit of the tax reform benefit. So total expense growth was also driven by higher headcount operate and operations in sales as well as continued growth and our combined PEO business and investments in technology.  The effective tax rate was 11.7% for the third quarter compared to 34.2% for the prior year\u2019s third quarter. So, let me explain that a bit. The significant decline in the effective tax rate is due to the tax reform, we are going to walk you through the detail for that shortly. Net income was up 29% to 260 million and adjusted net income increased 14% to 228 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 29% again for the third quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share 15% to $0.63. Let me provide some additional color in selected areas.  Payroll service revenue increased 2% for the quarter to 455 million and the growth was driven by an increasing revenue per check which improved as a result of price increases net of discounts. HRS grew 17% to 393 million for the third quarter, it reflected strong growth in the client based across most major HCM services as Martin mentioned including comprehensive HR outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance and insurance services all perform well.  Within Paychex HR services, we continued to see strong demand, which along with the acquisition of HROI is reflected in strong growth in the number of client worksite employees served. Our Paychex's PEO that doesn\u2019t include HROI has shown a surge of more than 20% of worksite employees from this time last year. Insurance services benefited from continued growth in the number of health and benefit applicants and higher average premiums within our workers comp insurance offering. Retirement services revenue benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of participant funds. Interest on funds held for client grew 37% in the third quarter to $18 million, primarily as a result of higher average interest rate turned a 1% increase in average investment balances and excellent portfolio management. Now provide some color on the impacts of tax reform on our third quarter. The largest impact as a reduction in the corporate statutory rate, which took us from 35% down to 21%. Paychex as Martin mentioned, there is a significant beneficiary of this change in the tax rate.  In addition, this overall change, we had several discrete items that reduced our effective tax rate to 11.7%. The first one is that we recorded a catch-up in our effective tax rate for the first six months of the year during the third quarter. This had a benefit of 36 million or an approximate 12% reduction on effective tax rate. The adjustment was necessary to conform our tax rate to the rate we expect for the client for our full year earnings. It\u2019s done in the third quarter, it got caught up.  We also had a one-time revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities that was a benefit of $20 million to the quarter, reducing our effective tax rate by approximately 7%. Since we were in a net liability position on our deferred taxes, a reduction in the prospective tax rate yields a benefit because it reduces the amount of taxes we would expect to pay in the future, so we had two adjustments, there, one catch up and one the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities, again it\u2019s all spelled out in the table should be pretty clear. As Martin previously mentioned we intend to utilize some of this benefit, the tax reform benefit to accelerate various investments in the business. These investments are in the following areas, technology for evolution of the customer experience, and continued digital transformation within that business, increasing spent in sales and marketing to drive revenue growth, investments to drive operational excellence and efficiency, and finally investment in our employees' part of which occurred this quarter. This accelerated investment will help drive future returns for shareholders.  Let\u2019s talk about investments and income. Our goal in our portfolio is to protect principal and to optimize liquidity on the short-term side, primary short-term investment vehicles were bank demand deposit accounts and variable rate demand notes; in our longer-term portfolio we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government agency securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.9% and currently has an average duration of 3.3 years.  Combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.6% for the third quarter which is up from 1.2% last year. We are realizing the benefit of a rising rate environment. Average balances for interest on funds for clients were approximately 1% for the third quarter, primarily driven by year-end bonus payments, wage inflation, partly offset by some client size mix. Let's talk about year-to-date, just cover that briefly, total revenue up 7%, of which about 2% was attributable to HROI payroll revenue up 1%, and HRS revenue up 13% over the nine months of the prior year. Operating income growth was 3% and adjusted operating income, which excludes some one-time charge following termination of certain licensing agreements reflected growth of 7%. Net income and diluted earnings per share grew 13% and 14%, respectively, on a GAAP basis to 705 million and 1.95 a share; adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted EPS were 16% and 17% respectively. Let me focus on our financial position next. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of 827 million as of February 28. 2018. Funds held for clients as of February 28th were 3.9 billion compared to 4.3 billion as of May 31, 2017. Funds held for clients as you know very widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged 4.6 billion for the quarter.  Total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized losses of 35 million as of February 28, 2018, compared with unrealized gains of 32 million as of May 2017. Our longer-term portfolio seen an increase in the unrealized losses due to recent increases in market rates of interest.  Total stockholders' equity was 2 billion as of February 26 2018, reflecting 539 million of dividends paid and 94 million dollars' worth of shares repurchased during the first nine months of fiscal 2018. A return on equity for the past 12 months, with a superb 45%. Our cash flows from operations were 989 million for the first nine months significant increase of 29% over the prior year period. This change was primarily a result of higher net income and timing impacts within working capital, largely related to income taxes and RPO payroll and related, unbilled receivables for payrolls, not yet processed as of the reporting date.  So now let's turn to guidance, we're updating it as you all saw, payroll revenue now anticipated to grow approximately 2% that includes contribution from the acquisition of Lessor, which we will see in the fourth quarter. We haven't mentioned it because to this point in terms of the results because it really had no impact in Q3. HRS revenue growth is expected to increase in the range of 13 to 14% for the full year incorporating HROI, interest on funds held for clients now expected to increase in the range of 20 to 25% that includes a very modest contribution from the Fed rate rise last week. Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 7%.  Operating income margin is anticipated to be approximately 38% that's down from our initial guidance, but the reason for that is that investment initiatives are now anticipated to impact margins for the full year by 150 to 175 basis points.  Our effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 28.5% 29%, investment income net is anticipated to be approximately 8 million, slightly lower than prior guidance due to the use of funds for the Lessor acquisition. Net income is expected to increase approximately 13% and adjusted net income non-GAAP is expected to increase approximately 15%. Diluted earnings per share is anticipate to increase in the range of 13 to 14% and adjusted diluted earnings per share non-GAAP is expected to increase in the range of 15 to 16. Now let's move to things that we typically and customarily do not provide but we need to because of the number of changes that are occurring in this quarter and going forward. Let me give you a start, let me start by giving you some color on the fourth quarter.  Our current expectations for the fourth quarter are, first, payroll revenue growth of approximately 3%. That includes contribution from Lessor, which will be a little bit less than or around 1% of payroll revenue. HRS revenue growth in the range of 15 to 16%. Total revenue growth of 8 to 9%. Operating income margins of 35.5% to 36%, effective tax rate of 30 to 31%. I should say that I'll talk about the contribution of Lessor for the full year fiscal '19 when I get there. As is our custom, we will provide guidance on fiscal 2019 on our fourth quarter call, since we are currently in the midst of our annual operating plan process, but to give you some direction based on the trends we\u2019re experienced I will provide the following comments. We anticipate that our payroll revenue growth for fiscal 2019 will be comparable to the rate we experience in the fourth quarter, which as I just mentioned is approximately 3% and that includes the contribution from Lessor and next year we anticipate that the contribution from Lessor will be less than 1% of total revenue.  We also anticipate that HRS will grow approximately 10% to 11%. This growth is comparable to the trend we experience this quarter, excluding the incremental impact of HROI. We have not made any assumptions of the stage on the impact of further fed rate increases, we expect they will come. But don\u2019t know when and what the time we want be, so we will update, when we get to the fourth quarter. With the full year of tax reform in fiscal 2019, we anticipate our effective income tax rate to be approximately 24% for fiscal 2019. Since we are taking the opportunity to use some of the tax reform benefit to accelerate investments in the business we anticipate that operating margins next year will be approximately 36%.  Finally, we anticipate that the acquisition of Lessor will be modestly diluted by about $0.02 in fiscal 2019. Let me just emphasize that these comments are preliminary and anticipate that some of you would ask this and it\u2019s important to update. So, you know the trajectory run, but there is subject to revision, when we issue guidance during the fourth quarter. Based on the trends we\u2019re absorbing in the business and could change based on actual fourth quarter results. I want to comment also that we\u2019re completing are now some of the impacts of the new revenue recognition standard and we\u2019ll update you in the fourth quarter. Please refer to our 10-Q for more information. We\u2019ll update you on all of these issues when we discuss financial guidance at the end of fourth quarter.  And now with all of that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Martin. Martin Mucci : Thank you, Efrain. Operator, we\u2019ll now open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question coming from the line of David Togut from Evercore. Your line is now open. David Togut : You called out 7% growth in new bookings for the quarter. So, two questions, number one how this compare versus your plan? And then second since you don\u2019t regularly give out this metric, does this mean, you\u2019ll start to slow this going forward? Martin Mucci : Not necessarily. But I thought I was trying to give some sense of the sales momentum coming out of the quarter. What the 7% was, there was the sales, the small business sales to new business, to new businesses. So, we had a nice growth in the sales, payroll sales to new small businesses that we\u2019re just starting up. And I think that tells a couple of things. One, that the number of new businesses continue start-up and two, that we\u2019re getting a bigger share of those new business start-ups than we were last third quarter. That was the difference. So, we\u2019re up 7% in sales to new businesses, on the small end over third quarter of last year. David Togut : And how does that compare versus your plans for the year? Martin Mucci : Well we don\u2019t talk about plan outside of the business David, but we were pleased with it, it was definitely better than we had last year, you could expect plan would have been very similar. So, it was a little stronger than we had anticipated from new business startups. David Togut : And then you mentioned growth in revenue per check, could you put some numbers around that for the February quarter? Efrain Rivera : We don\u2019t disclose necessarily the number that we are measuring that against David but I think what we are saying is we\u2019re getting more price out of customers, that\u2019s the point that we are making there. David Togut : And quick final question, 20% client count growth at the PEO pre-acquisition, can you just maybe flush that out a little bit, any specific reasons why the growth is that high, you expect that to be sustainable? Martin Mucci : Well we\u2019re very pleased with the performance of both the sales team and for our PEO organic, as well as HRY, but this was our organic PEO. And the retention teams. So, we had a very good retention. I think the way we've been pricing and the insurance changes, the benefit plans, that we have been able to offer and the very effective way that we service clients and sold to new clients, I think there\u2019s a growing demand for -- as we\u2019ve talked about on other calls, the PEO service, particularly with all the changes in healthcare and tax reform and all of these things, clients especially that midmarket are looking for more of a PEO than they ever have in the past, so we picked up more clients, saved more clients and we\u2019ve seen growth in the clients that we have in the worksite employees. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Jason Kupferberg : So, Efrain just a question on the fiscal \u201918 core payroll, I know you\u2019re obviously putting Lessor and therefore the Q4, so I just want to make sure we understand apples-to-apples because coming out of last quarter, I think we were talking about kind of the lower end of the 1% to 2% guidance range, so organically I guess is that still where we are or are you telling us that you feel a little bit better about where you fall in the 1% to 2% kind of organic putting Lessor on the side? Efrain Rivera : Yes, I guess what I am saying is that feel a little bit better today and in the mid-part of that range. Jason Kupferberg : And so now the key selling fusion is obviously passed, so just a couple of months left in the fiscal year, any view you would share in terms of where you see net client growth landing for the year, on an organic basis and as part of that just any general observations coming out of key selling season, when you talk about the new sale to newly formed businesses but any specific color on retention for example would be great? Martin Mucci : Yes, retention Jason we felt good about, we\u2019re really near historic highs and at least we\u2019re heading that way, we had a very good year end from the service and retention perspective and how we handle the clients and how we retained our clients, and even as we rolled off discounts and so forth, they have discounts that were a lot of times and that went well.  I would say on the sales side, I thought on the small end we did well as we said, we've got a bigger share of new sales to new businesses than we had last year up about 7% and in the midmarket it's just very competitive. So, I think however, when you look at it from the payroll side only it's very competitive now on both pricing and quality. On the PEO side as you have seen you know we've done very well. So, you're seeing a shift more than to that complete HR outsourcing and we're feeling good about that.  I would say overall in the sales side we feel like we have better momentum, we kind of started the first year slow, the first of the year slow, the first half and the back half we're coming out with better momentum on the sales side, kind of across the board and that includes insurance, retirement, everything is stronger in the second half, most everything is stronger in the second half.  On net client you know we only talk about it really after the year is over and so with all the things going on I'd continue to wait until we get done with the year to talk about it. Jason Kupferberg : Okay and then just lastly a clarification, so the fiscal '19 guidance, the preliminary outlook there was super helpful. You talked about approximately 36% operating margins inclusive of reinvestment, can you clarify how much reinvestment is baked into that 36%. Efrain Rivera : We'll talk about in the fourth quarter Jason, because then I'm going to get into a reconciliation exercise which we are not ready to do yet, so will talk more. But you can see that I'd say two things, one is that we indicated where we'd end the year so you can see where we will be versus the run rate where or the average for 2018, and you can also get a sense Jason from where we were on our initial guidance, what kind of, what kind of investments we're making. So that's the general direction I'd give. Operator : Thank you, our next question coming from the line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs, your line is now open. Jim Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe to follow-up on the prior question a little bit more, you know previously your last quarter, I think you talked about a bit of a negative mix shift in terms of client size to the smaller clients from the larger clients, or the midmarket clients, is that still, is that still in effect heading into fiscal '19 and if it is I guess that in cause implies that your client count, at least among the smaller clients could be up nicely and you're able to kind of hold the same pricing dynamics of 2% as you had. I just want to test those are indeed correct assumptions. Efrain Rivera : I would say this Jim that we're seeing compared to the quarter a year ago we're seeing some of that pressure easing, so we'll see as we -- you know the tricky part of calling the year in the third quarter is there's still a fourth quarter to go, so we'll see where we end but we think some of those pressures are starting to ease somewhat. Jim Schneider : Got it, and then just to kind of maybe you can clarify what you just said there a little bit, does that imply that the pricing pressure you have called out in the midmarket is abating slightly or is that more of a statement about the midmarket, sorry the down market selling momentum. Efrain Rivera : No, it's really a comment about the mix shift, we were experiencing a quarter ago or the same quarter a year ago. We\u2019re not experiencing the same level of mix shift, we were one year ago and so we would expect as we go through the year that to continue to normalize or to stabilize. Jim Schneider : And then just a follow-up for me. If I could, with respect to the investment portfolio, I think, you had called out last quarter, you may be considering some more wholesale changes given the impact of tax reform and the rates moving parts in terms of both the types of investments you\u2019re making, as well as the duration. Maybe just kind of comment on whether we can expect from those, some of those more wholesale changes to kind of play out and so what you are contemplating. Efrain Rivera : Yes. So, you know and everyone who has followed us know, we have tended to be pretty heavily weighted in municipal bonds with the advent of tax reform corporates look like a potential opportunity. And when we look at the after-tax returns on corporates, it looks like there may be some advantage as current rates to tilting a bit more towards corporates.  So, we\u2019re evaluating that, we\u2019re in the process of thinking about that. And you could see more corporate bonds in the portfolio, I recognize, it\u2019s very easy to say well on an after-tax basis, it really won't make that much of a difference it could have a modest after-tax impact. So, we\u2019re looking a little that and trying to factor in what we think by the time, we get to June, or fourth quarter, when we issue the guidance. What we think the right mix for the portfolio is based on our assumption of what the fed's going to do over the next 9 to 12 months. So that\u2019s where our thinking is right, nothing set in stone, that\u2019s why, I didn\u2019t call out that specific item when I talk a bit about \u201919. So that\u2019s where our thinking is currently. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Bryan Kean : So, I just want to ask about the operating margin. The fiscal year \u201919, Efrain you talked about 36%. Just curious, is there any one-time investments in fiscal year \u201919 that won\u2019t continue going forward? Just trying to get a sense of the real kind of continuous operating margin thereafter? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I think what Bryan, we\u2019ll update, when we\u2019re in fourth quarter, but some of that spending clearly is temporary over a couple year period. So, starting, we actually starting, we\u2019ll start some of it in \u201918 and it will expand into \u201919. But then you\u2019ll start to see some of that spending come down as we exit '20. So, some of the spending encourage in \u201919. Some of the spending at this point, we\u2019re thinking extends into \u201920 and then we see some of this spending roll off. So, we\u2019ll come back to you at the end of -- when we issue guidance at the end of the year. Bryan Kean : On the effective tax rate, I know with tax reform, the corporate rate went down to 21%. The fourth quarter, effective tax rate is higher, much higher than that 30 to 31. And then for the full year in \u201919 it doesn\u2019t quite get down to '21, it gets to '24, so just curious, some puts and takes on those tax rates? Efrain Rivera : Two quick things, first thing is on \u201919 is fed rate is 21, you got to bake in state taxes which are typically for us at least between three and four that\u2019s we don\u2019t get quite down to 21, so that\u2019s part.  And then with respect to 2018, you only have a partial year effective of tax reform. That's why you don't quite get down to the run rate in fiscal year \u201919, that\u2019s after you kind of filtered out all of the one timers that we\u2019ve got in there, the revaluation or devaluation, the revaluation of deferred taxes, when you kind of net it out, in very-very broad terms you\u2019re getting about five months of benefit in 2018, in 2019, you get 12 months of benefit and remember always it\u2019s not just 21%, it\u2019s also state tax, and there\u2019s other puts and takes, but that\u2019s basically what\u2019s going on. Bryan Kean : I thought the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter though was higher? Efrain Rivera : The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter is but the way taxes are booked is you are booking at the annual rate for taxes in the quarter, not the tax rate for that specific quarter, so when you do the catch up in Q3, you adjust to what you think the run rate will be excluding the discrete items and then you carry it through, that same rate based on whatever your estimate is for the full year into the fourth quarter. So, you\u2019re not doing a discrete tax rate for the fourth quarter. That's why that rate is where it\u2019s at. Bryan Kean : And then last one from me, I know you said 7% up in new sales in the small market, is there a metric there for new sales growth rate in that midmarket where there is a little bit more challenging with that group? Martin Mucci : No, we really don\u2019t break it out that much, I guess I would say, the point that I was making is on the midmarket side is payroll loan in those bundles continue to be very competitive and it\u2019s just a more difficult, it\u2019s about the same as it has been in a difficult competitive environment, we feel better on the PEO side which is in that midmarket and selling the complete PEO suite of services where that\u2019s continued to be very strong, and again on the small market, that\u2019s kind of a component of the small business sales, so what we\u2019re saying is new bid sales to new businesses is up 7% higher than it was last third quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Kartik Mehta : If you look at the payroll business and the payroll service revenue growth, do you think in essence it\u2019ll be a 1% to 2% growth over the next few years, the reason I say that we\u2019re in a very good economic environment, seems like you guys are executing well, or do you feel as though that business -- the core business can grow much better than that? Martin Mucci : Well I think certainly we\u2019re looking for more than that, I think it's been a couple of -- it\u2019s been a bit challenging on that low end from a -- sometimes from a price perspective, although when we build the bundles in we\u2019re getting more prices, Efrain mentioned earlier, and then I think we\u2019re hoping for a little bit stronger than that, and what\u2019s it\u2019s going to be in a go forward basis but that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019ve been for the last two years, but I do think it can be stronger than that, we just got a little bit more effective, and I think some of the investments we\u2019re making in the marketing side in particular for demand generation, you know the world is changed and while we've been making changes on lead generation to the small side and we've made changes in the selling approach where we've sold more of those very low end over the phone and through web leads, I think we're going to be more effective, even more effective on that next year. So, I think it's got some upside to it, I think we're continuing to revolve the way we get demand generation and as well as selling. Kartik Mehta : And then Efrain as you look at the interest on funds held for clients do you think based on wage growth and some of the other things that you talked about that we should start seeing growth in that, in the float portfolio. Efrain Rivera : Yeah, I haven't gone through the numbers but we had 1% growth Kartik this quarter, so I'd anticipate that we'll have at least modest growth in the portfolio next year in the absence of some change in the direction of the mix shift that we've seen over the last couple of years. Kartik Mehta : And then just one last question Efrain, just clarification when you talked about 2019 EBIT margins at 36% I'm assuming that excludes the forward portfolio revenue and impact from that, correct. Efrain Rivera : Well, so no, I said operating margin, want to just be careful, it\u2019s operating margins so that would include income from the float but I didn't give you any guidance as to what that float will be because at this point I don't have a good feel for where, where the fed rate rise is going to be. So that wasn't provided in that discussion. Kartik Mehta : Thank you, I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you, our next question coming from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets, your line is now open. Gary Bisbee : So, let me just [Multiple Speakers] by that last one, so the 36% is your GAAP operating margin outlook excluding any nonrecurring items that come up. Efrain Rivera : Yes, that's correct. Gary Bisbee : So that's down a couple hundred basis points, year over year and I guess part of that would be the acquisition because you said that would be dilutive as part of it, the investment, seems like you're not yet willing to talk about front and underlying trends for that, is that right? Efrain Rivera : That's correct, it's the investments plus the impact of acquisitions, that's correct Gary. Gary Bisbee : Okay, alright and so if I could just ask two bigger picture questions, can you give us a quick update on how you're thinking about the international strategy, you know you've been in Germany for a long time but it's never really grown to the point of being material now you're doing another acquisition that it sounds like bring some better technology, do you plan to really ramp investment at this in any point, should we think that it has the potential to become more material contributor to your overall growth in the next two years, or what's the strategy? Martin Mucci : Yeah, the strategy is that I think you know, while we've been in Germany and it\u2019s been a service model like more of a payroll specialist model type of thing, there hasn't been as much of a play on the technology side in Germany. We've grown okay there but it's not gotten, certainly as you mentioned significant from the way the company has grown from over $2 billion to over $3 billion in revenue. It's not going to get that significant, however we've been looking, we continue to look on the acquisition side for opportunities to grow in Europe, we think there was an opportunity to have a good day, particularly a low-end product that was payroll and HR and we think there was a nice opportunity there to grow because we didn't see as much competition on the a low end and they were in a place where we could acquire something so we had a couple of things we looked at and then Lessor we felt, it was very strong because it\u2019s already a platform in four different countries including Germany and so that will give us a technology, stronger kind of sell-served technology solution on the low-end and the mid-market solution in Germany from a technology standpoint. And there are reselling and Norway, Sweden and Denmark and very strong particularly in Denmark and have a platform that can grow in to other Western European country.  So, will it get significant compare to $3.5 billion in revenue. I\u2019m not sure, but it continues to offer opportunities for growth and profitable growth at that. And Lessor, the only thing about Lessor was, that they had a very strong development team and a very experience leadership team. So, we felt that the leadership team and development team is there in place and ready to build out that platform to grow not only in the existing four countries that they\u2019re in, but in many more in the future. Gary Bisbee : Is there an upgrade to drop some of the technology in development that you have done with the Flex offering into that market to accelerate what they\u2019re doing or improve their offering? Martin Mucci : Well, I think, I mean, I think it\u2019s certainly the expertise will be shared between the IT teams. They have a good IT leader, there was a lot, many years of experience and we worked very closely with the IT leadership team here that\u2019s working on Flex, our mobility platform and all of our integration in the cloud for HR and payroll. So, Lessor will certainly benefit, I believe from IT team here. But they\u2019ve got a very strong development team in the South, that was one of the thing that really was attractive to us, it\u2019s not just a service model for everyone\u2019s calling in and the payroll specialists is doing everything. We have that in Germany, this was adding a technology solution that has performed extremely well and is very much a leader in particularly Denmark and we think it can grow. Gary Bisbee : And then just a last one for me. Given the competitive stand to be a lot of chat or special among investors around the competitive outlook with software place. I wonder, if you could just give us a high-level update on share payroll and how that\u2019s gone since you\u2019ve acquired it, I know it was certainly growing robustly early on actually required it. But is that a channel to upgrade people to the more full-service model or is that an opportunity that people are agitating for a different offering from your core base and push them in that product or is it really being run separately right now and just another growth vehicle. Any color on where that? Martin Mucci : Sure. It\u2019s continue to perform very well from a growth perspective sales and retention. It\u2019s very much more of a do it yourself technology play, if anything, we\u2019ve seen the opportunities there of upgrading with you reinsure and you\u2019re continuing to grow and you\u2019re want a full breadth of products and services. You tend to go to Paychex and the Flex platform and we have a process in place that we\u2019ve had for many years with they can refer clients up based and not only based on whether they see it as an individual, but the data analytics as well. They will say these clients are ready to move and will be better place on Flex and we work clients through that. But it\u2019s been a very good low-end entry model for clients, who want to do it themselves, set themselves up and that\u2019s one of the reasons that we kind of keep that brand separate is part of Paychex, but it had that brand that competes very effectively, I think with some of these low-end, lower price competitors who want to do it yourself products. So, they continue to perform very well and certainly at or above our expectations. Efrain Rivera : And Gary what I\u2019d say to just to build on what Marty said. So sure informs us of what that, the part of the market that wants less expensive, do it yourself product is really looking for, but also Flex has significant self service capabilities itself, so what was your traditional full service outsourcing in the past is much more hybrid right now, and so if you want -- if you want more feature functionality you move to Flex, if you want a more basic system, you can be very well served by SurePayrolland I think that what's happening in the market, or what will continue to evolve in the market and this goes everywhere from, all the way from SurePayroll to Flex, frankly even to the PEO offering is that people are self-selecting on the kind of service they want. If they want very little DIY fast, if they want more, they\u2019ll go to Flex, if they want comprehensive outsourcing they\u2019ll go to the PEO, we see that continuing to evolve as we move into the future. Operator : Thank you. Next question coming from the line of David Grossman from Stifel Financial. Your line is now open. David Grossman : So, I think these questions come up in different forms, a couple of times on a call, just the dynamic with growth in the core payroll business but my recollection was that we had some midmarket retention issue in the prior year and perhaps some pricing kind of associated with that, and that perhaps we\u2019re anniversaring those losses now, or just helping put some upward lift into the payroll growth rate going forward, so I mean first am I getting that right, am I remembering that\u2019s right, and if so, how do we think about kind of what your expectations are for that kind of unit pricing dynamic going forward and core payroll is 1% to 2% really at this stage the maturity what we should be thinking for the business or should we be thinking differently now that you\u2019ve got an opportunity to invest in a different way? Martin Mucci : So, David great compound question there, so let me parse it into three pieces, so the first part of your question, yes that's correct we\u2019re anniversaring some of the effects that you did mention. I'd say it's less about losses and more about what the mix of sales was less a year ago, less midmarket, more small market, so I think we\u2019re anniversaring, starting to anniversary, some of that and also client retention plays into that picture. That\u2019s part A.  Part B, the pricing dynamic so we've always said it\u2019s one to three, you can\u2019t continue to price at that level, especially if you deliver value for the products that you provide the clients. If you provide excellent service, clients are very willing to give you -- consider those kind of price increases. I think what's changed is that going in price, when you sell now is more competitive, and that\u2019s a little bit more challenging but you still have an opportunity to price in the range that we have been trying you can\u2019t. And I didn\u2019t get the last part of the question. David Grossman : Well the last part of the question really was how to think about that pricing unit accretion going forward, and perhaps what's assumed in your preliminary fiscal guide, because it sounds like last year -- in the last 12 months at least we\u2019ve got probably 1%-unit growth and the balance of the growth came from pricing, how should we think about unit growth going forward? As that has probably been a challenge for the company and I was curious whether or not now that you\u2019ve got the tax rate benefits, reinvest at a higher rate, you know should we be hopeful at least that we can get some acceleration in that unit growth. Martin Mucci : I think that's a fair comment. Some of those investments are going to be geared to precisely that and I think you're right that that's where we're going to be putting some of our effort. Efrain Rivera : I think a couple of things, one is that I think very right as I mentioned earlier, some of the investments are pushing more toward accelerated marketing and demand generation. I think we were slower to this than we should have been as far as picking up more leads on the web, and then being able to close them more effectively, I think we've made some big changes this year into that, it's starting to pay off and we'll continue to accelerate that, there's just a different, a changing, I don't want say traffic like it's everything, but there's a changing model here, where as you would expect more people are searching, researching and deciding online and then making the call very quickly so it's going to have this balance, that we've been investing more in the virtual sales team, we got to have this balance of virtual sales, telephonic sales, who handle those leads and close the sales and the field and focusing the field on the larger clients even than some of the ones that come in on leads. Because on the leads they're ready to buy and do it over the phone or over a WebEx type of thing, they just want to see it, research it, and buy it. So, we're seeing that change and then on the midmarket, we definitely did see better retention this year than we did last year on the midmarket sales and through the end of the year, so that was a real positive for us and I think that's just you know more comprehensive products, better service and so forth. David Grossman : Thanks for the clarification on that, and just two quick follow ups, on was just the WSC growth. I just want to make sure that I heard that right, did you say 20% growth in WSCs on an organic basis, or was that client growth? Efrain Rivera : That was WSC growth not client, so that's correct. That's what we had for the PEO by the way that's what we're talking about. David Grossman : And that just seems like an extraordinarily high number to me based on history, I thought we were tracking kind of is that 10 to 12% range. So, am I remembering it right, because that seems like a big number to me, and if it is what changed? Efrain Rivera : I think as usual David your memory is good, and you are getting it right, it was 20% we had a really\u2026 Martin Mucci : We had strong earnings and retention. Efrain Rivera : We did actually very well. Good quarter. David Grossman : Was it a competitive dynamic, was it a market dynamic, I mean that just seems like close to 2X year growth rate where it had been trending and just curious was there some change in the business that would drive that kind of exceptional acceleration? Efrain Rivera : You know I'd say a couple of things, so we have made a big investment in sales execution on the PEO side, and it's, those things don't occur overnight and we're getting benefit from that, and I would say that's really kind of probably the number one reason why we're seeing that kind of benefit. Martin Mucci : I think also -- on the sales side as Efrain mentioned also retention, as I said we've been able to perform very well and therefore we've been able to have very good plans, insurance plans and pricing on those plans and I think that we definitely saw a nice improvement in retention as well. So, on both sides of the organic PEO, this is without HROI, we performed very well and we've been very focused on it as well. Efrain Rivera : I just want to, David, one other caveat to that is, we're just talking about PEOs not necessarily. So, at year-end, we update our entire worksite employee number, which includes our lower end product the ASO and the PEO. We still have more clients on the ASO, more worksite employees on the ASO. But we put a lot of focus on PEO, because we think there is opportunity there and its starting to pay benefits. David Grossman : Right. So, there is no increase in the risk profile business in terms of at risk or health insurance or anything like that? Efrain Rivera : Sure. Absolutely, there is no increase with profile and the risk profile. And of course, we monitor that very carefully. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of James Berkley from Barclays. Your line is now open. James Berkley : Just two questions here real quick. First, I noticed on the page 5 of the press release, you guys took out the $0.10 impact from the changing annual effective tax rate of 36 million there. But it looks like year-to-date, it was not taken out, it was left along so you got the 194 versus 184 if you just add up each quarter individually. Is that fair and then does that imply about $0.60 for 4Q for the full year guidance. How should we think about that? Efrain Rivera : We have to look at that Jim, I don\u2019t think that -- I think it will, it should be spelled out pretty clear in our investor presentation. James Berkley : And then quick follow-up just on the Lessor Group. Just commenting on some of the target markets, you\u2019re seeing beyond the one that you\u2019re currently exposed to there in Europe and if you could give any detail around the margin or the growth rate of the company? That will be great too. Thanks. Martin Mucci : Can you say that again, I couldn\u2019t catch that last part? Was that European on Lessor or\u2026 James Berkley : Yes. So, you\u2019re talking about some of the markets that you are currently in the ability to kind of realized revenue synergies hopefully in Germany overtime. But what are some of the other markets that, I think you could expand until beyond that ones that it\u2019s exposed to now? Martin Mucci : Sure. I think there is always some work being done our product that would get into Spain or France and Poland. So, I think the other markets, something that we haven't been able to do, because we didn\u2019t want to necessarily put the investment into the development of each platform. We\u2019re kind of at a stage now and Lessor is at a stage that we found, that has a solid platform and a way to update and build out those platforms for various countries at an effective way. They are profitable and we believe that durable service model, which is very much a do it yourself model is going to be a good way to go in Europe right now as we move forward. There is a number of and with the success they have seen in those four countries. We think we can easily expand others. Our focus right now will be, how we drive penetration in those four countries, but then after that expand to others probably more 18 to 24 months down the road. James Berkley : Great. Thanks a lot. Efrain Rivera : Jim one, I think, I understood your question, I apologize, I was not tracking. So, when you look at the table, the $0.10 really relates to Q3 and it\u2019s the catch-up that now gets Q3 to close to $0.30, I\u2019m sorry 30%, when you make the adjustment in that quarter. You\u2019re catching up those first two quarters, that\u2019s why Q3 is low and then you exit the year at around that rate. There is puts and takes there. So, if that\u2019s not clear, just give me a buzz back and we can talk about it further. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO. Your line is now open. Henry Chien : Hey good morning guys, it\u2019s Henry Chien calling in for Jeff. Just a high-level question. I know you mentioned some of the metrics kind of highlighting the tightness of the labor market and wage inflation, or earnings picking up, just curious in light of that kind of environment with the tighter labor market what\u2019s kind of changed for your sales or demand from your perspective? Martin Mucci : Well I think we\u2019re not having a strong -- the recovery was very long and slow from additional jobs and new business startups, new business startups have now kind of gotten back to where they were kind of pre-recession long time ago now, and seemed to be holding and then in the jobs, the job growth is back to kind of a normalized component, at least in our review for -- and this is clients under -- this is businesses under 50 employees is what we focused that on. We\u2019re back to kind of a normalized growth of businesses and employment growth, back to kind of 2004, which was our base year.  And then the wages should pick up some, so we've seen wage growth that held under 2% for -- pretty consistently until about a year ago. Now it\u2019s starting to tick up, we actually saw it very close to 3% which was nice and strong, and now it\u2019s kind of drifted back into that 2.7% which is a little strange, but I think it's going to end up closer to that 3% because of the shortage of employees, with specific skills and so forth.  Plus, you are also seeing at the very low end a lot of minimum wage increases are going into effect. So when you put that in depending on the time of the year you are going to see something probably closer to 3% and in those kind of front end jobs you are going to see something stronger even probably 4% to 5%, and I think, all of that kind of bodes well for checks, also, what really bodes well is that with that job growth and wage growth, more and more businesses small and midsized are going to need products that are full payroll and HR outsourcing. Henry Chien : And that kind of leads to my follow-up question for the investments that you\u2019re making just curious what\u2019s sort of driving the decision to ramp up investments and any color you can give on what these investments are, or is it focused on sales and execution in light of the more positive environment or any kind of color you can give that\u2019d be great? Martin Mucci : I think you always want to spend more to accelerate growth and so we wanted to take advantage of some of the tax reform benefit to do that, so what we\u2019re finding is technology spends so we, particularly in the client interface, so from mobility platforms and what we\u2019re building into our mobility platform it's been very popular with clients. The reporting platform, the analytics, all of the things that clients want and the HR administration piece of it, there's always things that we want to do faster than we already have to be ahead of competition and we decided that given this benefit to us because we are very profitable company this is a good time to reinvest and accelerate a few of these projects that are on our roadmap and so you'll see in enhancements to a client interface and both mobility and in the breadth of products as well, we\u2019re accelerating those. If you look at marketing spend the marketing spend will go up as well as the sale spend, because we think with marketing -- new marketing generation tools and a bigger spend and a more focused spend, that we can get more leads into Paychex and that we\u2019ll be able to close more sales with the focus of those leads. So we\u2019re putting more emphasis on our marketing leads, our marketing spend and demand generation, as well as you\u2019ll see the sales team grow, we\u2019re not kind of right at this point ready to say how much it'll grow, but there will be a combination of growth between the virtual or telephonic sales teams and the field sales teams, because we think the opportunity is there to sell more if we had more people out there, which is a good thing. Henry Chien : Got it, okay great, thanks so much for the color. Operator : Thank you, our last question coming from the line of Mark Marcon from Baird, your line is now open. Mark Marcon : Good morning, thanks for squeezing me in. Had a few questions, kind of clean ups but on the investments in as they relate to the operating margin going to 36% for 2019. Where would they fall in terms of between direct operating expenses versus SG&A, how should we think about that, number one. And number two as it relates to that specific item, you know it sounds like some of that's going to continue through 2020. But once we normalized how should we think about the pattern of margin expansion and pace of margin expansion going forward once we once we get through that investment phase that's number one. Number two and I'll be glad to repeat these number two, on the PEO side where you're getting the wins, are those primarily coming from clients that have existing PEO relationships or are you seeing a lot of white space out there where you're selling into clients that don't have a current PEO and how does that make you think about the PEO market and number three you didn't buyback any stock this quarter, wondering is that because of Lessor. How should we think about that? Martin Mucci : Let me start with the PEO one. Efrain can jump in on the stock one and the others. I think one on the PEO I think it's a combination Mark. I think we certainly have been able to win over with our service and our plans and our pricing in sales execution existing PEO clients in a number of markets. So, I think we've had very competitive offerings that have done well. I also think we're selling PEO, we also have seen experience with selling PEO to some new client that have not had PEO before and as I mentioned earlier I think it's continuing to evolve that more and more clients are looking for that HR support and the co-employment is getting more known not only because of us but because of competitors out there as well. That is becoming more known and more comfortable with clients who have not experienced that before, because of tax reform, because of you know all of the HR requirements, because of healthcare.  You know, things are changing it's probably the most confusing one of the most confusing times we've ever had from what federal government is doing in and of, the federal government, the state governments I've mentioned before, regulations are going up, minimum wage changes, family leave act changes, there's never been a time frankly when there's been probably more confusion as to what I have to do particularly if I'm a multistate business. So, I think PEO is both, PEO for us has definitely been both those who already have it and those who don't have it but are now finding it as a good alternative. Mark Marcon : Marty, is it silly to think, take all your comments together, sounds like a pretty obvious opportunity, no? Martin Mucci : Definitely, definitely and that's why as Efrain mentioned, I think I've mentioned, we put more sales teams towards this, this was behind acquisition of HROI, we felt it was a very good PEO that was doing some things different than we were and they were very effective, they were ahead of what we expected from them. So, and it's early, just from last August so I think this is definitely an opportunity and you're seeing us put more investment in the PEO and it from a sales and execution standpoint and product standpoint. Mark Marcon : The more you put in, the more encouraged you\u2019re getting? Martin Mucci : Yes. I would definitely say that right now. Efrain Rivera : Mark as to your question on the split between the investment. So, let me just bracket them. I can\u2019t give you direct answer yet, I\u2019ve got a wait till fourth quarter. But in part is, because there some of the categories might shift between our current\u2026 Mark Marcon : Sure. And part of it is just an allocation that\u2019s subjective. Efrain Rivera : Right. But so, let me just sort of generally say that that a reasonable way to think about it is, that about a third of the investments would be, on the operating expense side and two-thirds would be on SG&A. before I go further, just remember that in our business, ITs and G&A. So that\u2019s why two-thirds is going into SG&A, Marty mentioned sales and marketing demand driven spending that will be one focus and then lots of IT projects that were on board and that we\u2019re accelerating forward to try to get in over the next couple of years or so accelerate the opportunities we get from doing that. So more to come in Q4 and we can talk about it then. On the share buyback, we buyback for dilution if you look back at where we were in the quarter, we\u2019re not too far from or expected to be, we\u2019ll do more buying as we head into first quarter next year. Mark Marcon : And then just going back on the just the pace of margin expansion once we get past the early part of fiscal \u201920? Martin Mucci : Yes. So, I think when we get beyond that, I\u2019ll have to, we\u2019ll reserve discussion on how quickly we can expand margins. But we certainly be our expectation getting through this period that we continue to expand margin and part of the investment is intended to drive that as we come out of the period. How quickly, we\u2019ll have to see, how the projects go and how they payoff. But that\u2019s clearly in the forefront of our mind. Efrain Rivera : Yes. The idea of these investments and taking some of the benefit from tax reform spend is the drive more better and stronger top-line, sustainable top-line growth. And that we\u2019ll start to bring the margin back is opposed to just trying to look at more we\u2019re cutting costs. We\u2019ve always been good at keeping costs out, we\u2019re pretty targeted as to where these investments are going to be and hopefully how long they\u2019re going to last and then start to see margin improvement, because of the growth in the top-line back into the ranges that we have in the past. Mark Marcon : And then just thinking about the balance sheet and the strength of the free cash flow and the sustainability of it. You mentioned, you might change a little bit, what you\u2019re doing in terms of the investments on the slowdown. How are you thinking about just the balance sheet in general, I mean just given the recurring nature of the cash flows and the strength of the business, leverage levels, things of that nature? Martin Mucci : Yes, Mark. What I\u2019d say is as we look to tax reform another bucket that we targeted was at the margin being able to do more M&A. I think the fact that we did Lessor in Q3 is the first indicator of that. We will be active in looking at opportunities at this stage, non-transformational but we think we have obviously a lot of ability to do the right kinds of M&A and we think there\u2019s targets out there that are of interest to us. Operator : Thank you. At this time there\u2019re no questions over the phone. Speakers you may proceed. Martin Mucci : Thank you. At this point we\u2019ll close the call and if you\u2019re interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for about 30 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our third quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

If you have any objections, you may disconnect now. May I introduce your speaker for today, the President and Chief Executive Officer, Martin Mucci. Please go ahead. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Thank you for joining us for the discussion of our Paychex's fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2018. You can access our earnings release and our Investor Relations webpage and our 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about one month. On today's call, I will review the business highlights for the fourth quarter. Efrain will review our fourth quarter and full year financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal 2019. And then we will open it up for your questions. We were pleased with our strong finish to the fiscal 2018 and the progress we made on key initiatives. Our total revenue growth was 9% for the fourth quarter and 7% for the fiscal year including our acquisitions of HROI, and the Lessor Group. As of May 31, 2018 we served over 650,000 payroll clients. We acquired HROI, a national PEO in August of 2017, and acquired the Lessor Group, a payroll and HR service provider headquartered in Denmark at the end of February 2018. We are pleased with both of these acquisitions which have so far exceeded our expectations and are progressing well, and we believe these acquisition position us well for the long-term growth in both our PEO and international businesses. At the start of fiscal 2018 we implemented certain changes on our sales go-to-market strategy. Our results - we started off slowly in the first half of the year but gained momentum in the second half. We are particularly pleased with the sales performance in our comprehensive HR outsourcing services including our PEO business which performed well in both sales and client retention. And excluding Lessor, our payroll client base was comparable to last year. Client retention was greater than 81% of our beginning fiscal year payroll client base at the end of last year. We just completed the realignment of our service organization to allow greater flexibility and customization of our service - the service our clients receive and during that transition we experienced a slight reduction in retention. In fiscal '18 client lost trends improved as the year progressed and in particular we showed strong retention in our comprehensive HR outsourcing solutions for the year. Job growth among small businesses is moderated and the unemployment rate is the lowest we've seen in many years. These reflect the tightening labor markets. We are well positioned at Paychex to help business owners make positive changes to wages, benefits and their challenging employee recruiting environment that will aid them in competing for top talent. Within the small business sector, entrepreneurship is also near peak levels and since the recession which has helped to create jobs and drive the economy. Overall business owners have a positive outlook on small business economic environment and hiring. We're constantly evaluating strategic opportunities to bring value to our customers and help them grow their businesses. In this past month we launched several new innovative offerings that are being well received to start. First, we introduced Paychex Promise which was its first of a kind offering in the payroll and HR industry. Paychex Promise is a subscription-based service that delivers peace of mind to business owners through protection against payroll interruptions and solutions to address the routine challenges of running a successful business. The primary offering is payroll protection which extends the collection period of payroll funds from a businesses' bank account by seven days without interruption of service. This will allow business owners to pay their employees and remit taxes on time regardless of cash flow timing issues. This is particularly helpful for small businesses that many times have cash flow timing challenges. This service also provides access to other tools to help businesses build their credit files, stay on top of regulatory changes, and resolve fraudulent events. We are pleased with the positive reactions to this service received so far in the market with over 1,000 clients joining us so far. Second, we announced the partnership with Workplace by Facebook to introduce a social collaboration tool to the company's HCM suite. This platform allows for secure space for companies and their employees to connect, communicate and collaborate in the digital age fostering increased productivity and efficiency. The partnership with Workplace allows client employees to gain access to their Paychex flex information without logging into flex directly. We're bringing the information to them in their social collaboration space. We are committed to delivering best-in-class technology solutions for our clients and business partners and in April we added new features to our financial advisor counsel to enhance the user experience, to manage their book of business with Paychex and of course earlier this year we did announce Accountant HQ to help our accounting partners. We were honored to be named to the Forbes 2018 list of the world's 100 most innovative companies indicating that investors believe Paychex is among the firms most likely to continue to develop the next big innovation. I am very proud of our service organization for the receipt of a bronze medal for the Customer Service Department of the Year from the American Business Awards for the second consecutive year. The center is part of the ABA Stevie Awards which are widely considered to be the world's top honors for sales and customer service. Paychex clients are empowered to choose the way in which they like to be serviced, dedicated payroll specialist, dedicated relationship manager, 24x7 call-center, social media options, or a self-service approach. This flexible service these many options along with responsiveness, reliability and the knowledge of our service givers allows Paychex the backup our leading edge technology with world-class service. We were very excited to celebrate our 15 years of partnership with the AICPA CPA.com through the Paychex partner program. The partner program designates Paychex as the preferred provider of payroll, HR and retirement services and offer special benefits for the clients of the program members. Paychex and CPA.com partner to enhance the CPA profession's role as in a trusted advisor to their clients and we provide unique value to CPA's in the program through the account specific experience in the Paychex Accountant HQ and a dedicated account service model. Paychex is a significant beneficiary of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as we talked about last quarter. As we discussed, we have already initiated our plans to use a portion of these benefits to accelerate investments and the business in the areas of sales and marketing and product innovation. These investments continue into fiscal '19 and will provide additional product offerings and next-generation platforms that will position us well for longer-term growth. The substantial portion of the tax savings of course is going to our shareholders. In April we announced an increase in the quarterly dividend of $0.06 or 12% to $0.56 per share. This increase was a fiscal quarter earlier than our typical dividend increase and was one way to assure the savings directly with their shareholders. During fiscal '18 we also paid-out $740 million in dividends to our shareholders which represents approximately 80% of our net income. We also continue to repurchase Paychex common stock to offset dilution using about $143 million for that purpose in fiscal '18. In summary our fourth quarter closed out another successful year for Paychex. We are an essential partner to our clients helping them succeed and grow their businesses through recruiting, engaging and supporting their employees. Our innovative technology full suite of HCM product offerings and flexible service model is a powerful combination that positions us for sustainable growth within our market ecosystem. Our organic business combined with our new acquisitions have positioned us well for fiscal 2019 and beyond. I greatly appreciate the work of all of our employees and the management teams and their efforts everyday for our clients and their colleagues. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks Marty, and good morning to everyone. I would like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements referred to the customary statements in that regard and our related risk factors. In addition, I will periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share. These measurements include certain discrete tax items and one-time charges. Please refer to the press release and investor slide presentation for a discussion of these measures and our reconciliation for the quarter and full year fiscal 2018 to their related GAAP measures. We posted on our Investor Relations site our normal quarterly investor presentation and in addition we\u2019re providing a supplemental presentation that outlines the impact to our financial statements of the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 revenue from contracts with customers. This is effective for us at the beginning of fiscal 2019. The changes are modest and you'll see that but they have an effect on the quarterly period and so you will need to look at that to understand what's going on. This presentation also reflects the impact of tax reform and other non-GAAP measures. My discussion on the fourth quarter and full year results on this call will be under current revenue recognition standards. When I discuss our forward-looking guidance for fiscal year '19, I will be providing guidance incorporating the impact of ASC 606. Again it's relatively modest but it does impact the quarters and there's a one tax item that you'll just need to look at when you look at that presentation. I'll be hosting a separate call at 11 o'clock to walk through the impact of ASC 606 and other items for those who are interested in participating. I\u2019ll start by providing some of the key highlights for this quarter and then provide greater detail in certain areas. I will touch briefly on full year results and wrap with the review of the fiscal '19 outlook. Revenue growth as Marty mentioned was 9% for the quarter and grew to $871 million and this was aided by HROI and Lessor and as Marty said they performed well. Expenses increased 11% for the fourth quarter. The acquisitions of HROI and Lessor together contributed approximately 7% of total expense growth for the fourth quarter. Higher PEO direct insurance pass through cost for a factoring expense growth, as well as higher headcount due to accelerated investment in our sales and product teams. The effective income tax rate was 28.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 35% for the respective prior year quarter. The significant decline year-over-year in the effective tax rate is due to tax reform. This effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was lower than we anticipated due to discrete tax benefits recognized in the fourth quarter related to employee stock-based comp and an adjustment in the fourth quarter to the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities. So you can look at that, it\u2019s in the press release and its detailed. Net income increased 17% to $229 million for the fourth quarter. Our adjusted net income increased 13% to $219 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 17% to $0.63 for the fourth quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13% to $0.61. We call out some of those items simply because some of them are very difficult to predict. I\u2019ll provide some additional color in selected areas. Payroll service revenue increased 3% in the fourth quarter to $452 million. The increase resulted from the Lessor acquisition which contributed approximately 1% to growth and an increase in revenue per check which improved as a result of price increases net of discounts. HRS revenue increased 17% to $401 million for the fourth quarter of which the acquisition of HROI contributed almost 8%. The remaining growth was driven by strong growth in client based across most major HCM services including our comprehensive HR outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance, and insurance services. Strong demand within our Paychex HR services which is reflected in continued double-digit growth in the number of client worksite employee service. PEO in particular reflected strong growth. As of May 31, 2018, PEO ending worksite employees and this excludes HROI were at 19% higher than in May 31, 2017 and were higher than our number at the end of February 28, 2018. I got a number of questions on that following third quarter call. We had a very, very strong year in PEO and expect that momentum to continue. Insurance services benefited from continued growth in the number of health and benefit applicants and higher average premiums within our workers comp insurance offering. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the value of participant funds. Let\u2019s talk about interest on funds held for clients. They increased 27% for the fourth quarter to $18 million primarily as a result of higher average interest rate earned. And turning to our investment portfolio, our goal is to protect principle and not optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, primary short-term investment vehicles are bank demand deposit accounts and variable rate demand notes. In the longer-term portfolio we invest primarily in high credit quality municipals bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government agency securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.9%, average duration is now 3.1 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.7% for the fourth quarter up from 1.3% last year and we're beginning to realize the benefit of increasing interest rates you just saw that the Fed recently raised interest rates again. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients were down modestly for the fourth quarter primarily driven by impacts of tax reform and client employee withholdings and the impact of average client size mix partly offset by wage inflation. I\u2019ll provide some - a few points on the results for the full year fiscal 2018 just - so we keep the year-to-date in context. Revenue growth was 7%, payroll revenue up 2% and HRS revenue was up 14% compared to fiscal 2017. HRI contributed less than 6% to the growth and HRS revenue for the year. The impact of Lessor on payroll revenue growth for the full year was negligible. Operating income growth was 4% and adjusted operating income which excludes the one-time charge following termination of certain licensing agreements reflected growth of 6%. Net income and diluted earnings per share grew 14% to 15% respectively on a GAAP basis to $934 million and $2.58 per share. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS were up 15% and 16% respectively to $920 million and $2.55 per share. This figure is comparable to what you'll see for 2018 when we restate for ASC 606 but I\u2019ll talk a bit more about it the quarter shift a bit and you need to pay attention to that. Now financial position, it remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of 720 million as of May 31, 2018. Funds held for clients were $4.7 billion compared to $4.3 billion as of May 31, 2017. Funds held for clients very widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $4 billion for the fiscal year. Our total available-for-sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized losses of $38 million as of the end of the year compared with net unrealized gains of $32 million as of the end of 2017 fiscal. Our longer-term portfolio seen an increase in unrealized losses due to recent increases in market rates of interest. Total stockholders' equity was $2 billion as of May 31, 2018 reflecting $740 million in dividends paid and 143 million of shares repurchased during fiscal 2018, a return on equity for the past 12 months was a stunning 46%. Our cash flows from operations were $1.3 billion for the fiscal year, a significant increase of 33% over the prior year. This change was primarily a result of higher net income and timing impacts within working capital largely related to income taxes and our PEO payroll and related unbilled receivables for payrolls not yet processed as of the reporting date. The prior year reflected larger outflows impacted by higher accounts receivable balances related to growth in our payroll funding business for temporary staffing agencies. Fiscal 2019, I\u2019ll remind you that our outlook is based on our current view of economic conditions continuing with no significant changes. Payroll revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of 2% to 3% incorporating a full year of Lessor. Growth in payroll revenue for the first quarter will be below the full-year range. It will be closer to approximately 1% and the remaining quarters will be at or above the high-end of the range, [beginning] is impacted by the composition of processing days within quarters particularly the first quarter and normalizes as we go through the year but we have some impact because of that composition in the year. HRS revenue growth is anticipated to increase in the range of 10% to 11% for the full-year. The HROI acquisition impacts gating of growth for fiscal 2019 with the growth for the first half being above the high-end of the full-year range, while the second half is slightly below the low-end of the range and if you remember we acquired HROI at the end of first quarter. So we\u2019ve got a little bit of incremental revenue from HROI in the first quarter. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to increase in the range of 15% to 20%. The guidance contemplates two additional rate increases in calendar year 2018 but no further increase and let me just clarify that that means that we - at this point anticipate that will have two more raises in the year in all likelihood in the fall and at the end of the year based on what the Fed has said and we're incorporating that guidance nothing further than that. Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 6% to 7%. Operating income margin is anticipated to be approximately 37%. We anticipate that operating margins will be impacted by accelerated investment initiatives, as well as some impact from anticipated growth in PEO pass through insurance costs. Effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%, investment income net is anticipated to be approximately $50 million. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of 11% to 12%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to increase approximately 11%. We anticipate that the growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first, second and fourth quarters will be a bit higher than the annual anticipated growth rate and growth for the third quarter will be approximately 5% as Q3 of fiscal 2018 is impacted by the change - was impacted I should say by the change in the corporate statutory rate. In order to understand this guidance you need to refer to the ASC 606 presentation that either is posted or will be posted shortly to the website. There is some shifting in quarters. We do a very comprehensive reconciliation from as reported GAAP to what we're calling our adjusted number. As I previously mentioned, this guidance is presented reflecting the adoption of ASC 606 which is effective for us in fiscal 2019. Again there is schedule that\u2019s been posted to the website or will be posted shortly. We finalized our evaluation with new standard and the most significant impact of Paychex will be the deferral of cost to obtain and cost to fulfill our contracts over the average life of clients. Currently sales commissions and bonuses, as well as salaries related to client onboarding activities are primarily expense when incurred. These costs will now be deferred and recognized over the average life of a client. The impact of this add slightly more than $0.02 to adjusted diluted EPS for 2018 and we anticipate a similar result for fiscal 2019. So the impact one year to next is relatively small, doesn\u2019t shift margin significantly but it does have impacts on the quarters. There are minor changes to our revenue which will be immaterial on an annual basis as I said but will impact beginning of the fiscal quarters. The changes from the new standard are all timing related and have no impact on cash flows of the company. We\u2019ll implement a new standard using the full retrospective method which will result in restatement of prior year's results and allow for more meaningful comparisons. By restating fiscal 2018 under new guidance, the result is overall growth rates for revenue. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share that are comparable to those anticipated prior to implementing the new standards. So the growth rates will be pretty consistent. As I previously mentioned, we've included a presentation on the IR website to provide greater transparency on the impact of the new standard. It summarizes the impacts of the new standard and recast financial statements for fiscal 2017 and 2018, as well as quarterly impacts for fiscal 2018 including the impact of tax reform and other non-GAAP adjustments. You\u2019ll need to refer that to their presentation to get next year right, specially the quarters. ASC 606 also requires us to make additional disclosures in the footnotes to our financial statements concerning our revenue streams. As I had mentioned previously, our breakdown of revenue between payroll and HRS is becoming less meaningful as we are selling more product bundles and payroll becomes an allocation out of those bundles. This trend resulted from our evolution to an integrated HCM provider. We believe that under new guidance there is more meaningful way to disclose the drivers of our revenues. Therefore as we move into fiscal 2019 and begin to provide new disclosures around revenue, we\u2019ll begin to align revenue guidance in the same manner starting in Q1. This will provide more disclosure not less, so - and you'll still see payroll and HRS. In the future, our revenue will be desegregated into two categories, one will consist of revenues associated with our integrated suite of HCM products. Second category which will break out will PEO and insurance revenues. We\u2019ll continue as I said to provide supplemental information on payroll and HRS revenue during the transition to align models that won\u2019t be any change will be talking about all of those details. So we\u2019re not going to change models in the short run. Between now and the end of our first quarter, we\u2019ll also provide on our Investor Relations website as scheduled with historical revenue detailed under the new revenue disclosures so that you can update models accordingly. I'll be holding a separate conference call at 11 for approximately one half hour. For those who wish to participate, go through ASC 606 and really talk about what 2018 look like under that standard and again there is a shift in quarters and there is one tax item to discuss but otherwise it's pretty similar certainly on the overall year basis. We\u2019ll take you through the presentation, it's on the website on the impacts at that point of ASC 606 and other items. And now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Marty. Martin Mucci : Great. Thanks Efrain. Operator, we\u2019ll now open up the call to any questions . Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Rayna Kumar : This is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. Thanks for taking my question. On your third quarter earnings call, you provided preliminary payroll revenue for guidance of 3% and now it's been revised to 2% to 3%. What's changed in the business since then? Efrain Rivera : Very little, I think when we looked at the composition of days I just mentioned that, we saw that there was going to be an impact to revenue from one less day, it's in the range of about 25 to 30 basis points. When I looked at that and looked at where the range was, I just thought it was better to be a little bit more conservative than we had been when we were in Q3. By the way Rayna, I also said it was preliminary, I also provided other guidance on margins that changed. So, we did some more refinement, this is where we ended up. Rayna Kumar : Could you call out fourth quarter bookings growth and also discuss your expectations for FY '19 bookings? Martin Mucci : I'll take that. I think we don't give bookings growth in detail, but I would tell you that, kind of what we saw in fiscal '18 was, we had go-to-market strategy at the beginning of fiscal '18 that shifted the number of - particularly the micro sales into an in-house virtual team or telephonic sales team, and we kind of miss call that one a little bit as far as how long it would take to gear that up and some of the leads and so forth. So we started off kind of the first half of the year lower than we had expected but really gained some great momentum. And so we're feeling very good that through selling season in January and third quarter and then into fourth quarter, we actually ended up in the fourth quarter the best quarter of the year for us from a performance year-over-year in selling, and it gives us great momentum when we see that carrying into June right now. So, we really started on the low end of what we had expected, below what we expected, and then have come back with great momentum as the inside teams in particular have gotten used to handling the leads, gain tenure, and the productivity is up substantially from the first quarter of 2018. Rayna Kumar : And just one final question from me. For your 2019 service revenue guide, how much of a benefit are you incorporating for acquisitions from HROI and Lessor? Efrain Rivera : There's a modest impact to payroll service revenue, about 1%, and Lessor is pretty minor, certainly less than 1%. Operator : And our next question is coming from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Jason Kupferberg : I just wanted to clarify one of the things I think I heard in Marty's prepared remarks. I'm just trying to get a kind of organic client growth at year end and I think I heard kind of flattish year-over-year x Lessor, is that right? And I guess if so, I think that would be kind of two straight years where we're pretty flat on that metric. Do we expect organic growth there in fiscal '19? Martin Mucci : Yes, we do. And you're right, it's been pretty comparable - without Lessor it would be pretty comparable to last year. Again, I think while we saw some improvement in retention which we saw dropped last year, the previous year, '17, we saw an improvement in retention kind of across the Board as we settled on to the new service kind of model and so forth. And in sales we started out on the first half of the year as I said, low, and had to kind of dig ourselves out of that in through selling season and then into fourth quarter gained a lot of momentum. But we ended up about comparable on the client base before - without Lessor. And, so yes, you're right; and we definitely expect gain this year. I think we've got great momentum going into June and the first quarter coming out of fourth quarter again our best sales quarter of the year which it isn't always, but this has been our best fourth quarter, and we really ramped up the inside sales team as kind of back to meeting the productivity that we had expected at the beginning of the year. Jason Kupferberg : And I just wanted to ask a follow-up on the organic outlook for next year, just getting into the segment level. We were trying to parse that out a little bit, we were kind of landing may be around 1.5%ish for core payroll and 8% to 9% on the HRS side. Are those ranges about right? I know you talked about it earlier in the context of total services revenue, but I wanted to break it apart so people have the models on it. Efrain Rivera : We're between 2% and 3%, and you picked the midpoint and you're going to get about 1.5% organic, and then I would say it's about a point maybe a little bit less, little more, it depends on how you look at it on the HROI contributions, so take that out and I think you're closer to 9% to 10%. Jason Kupferberg : And just my last question, in the quarter itself, looked like the operating margins actually came in like 50 bps above the high end of what you had guided to. So, was that just timing of investments and some of those getting pushed to the right or were there some other factors that surprised you to the upside? Efrain Rivera : I think it was primarily timing of investments, Jason. So, you make an estimate of where you think expenses will come in, it was a little bit lighter than what we thought. Martin Mucci : I think one point on that is, Efrain, as we talked about before at some of the conferences in the last quarter, I think we estimated, we were pretty conservative on the margins from the investments that we said we would make from tax reform. And so we kind of went a little bit on the lower end and we have brought that back a bit. So, you saw approximately 37% and then you've also seen the guidance that Efrain has given on that going forward. So feel like, as we've looked at it, and tightened up the investments that we've already started to make from tax reform and accelerate those investments, that's where we're going to be which I think some interpret us to be a little lower than that, we don't see that happening. Operator : And our next question is coming from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Jim Schneider : Efrain, on the margin guidance, seems like the 37% number you're guiding to now, little bit better than the 36% you talked about preliminarily on the last conference call. So, can you maybe just give us a sense of, are you finding some kind of extra core savings in the business elsewhere to offset some of the investments or the investments a little bit less or how should we think about the outlook for margins now and I may guess more importantly as you look forward from here do you think you can kind of return to attain some margin expansion? Efrain Rivera : Yes, so let me take the second. So, the answer to second is that\u2019s our anticipation that starting next year, meaning 2019. We begin with a cadence of margin expansion and how much to be decided as we go through the year. I would say Jim, all of the projects that we contemplated in Q3 are still the ones that we're working on, and I think the differences we refined a bit what our estimates were for the spend on those projects, and it came in a bit better than our initial estimate suggested. So, I think that's what it is. It does mark a significant departure from what we were contemplating doing, just little bit more pencil sharpening. Jim Schneider : And then I guess maybe, Marty, you could maybe take this one. Just kind of curious about the overall kind of employment picture you're seeing in the SMB and down market space, clearly from a macro perspective, I think as we've talked about several times before, those job ads have kind of been disappointing through the cycle in that segment of the market. So, I'm wondering if you see anything in the market that gives you little bit more hope that SMB drive growth just on overall economic basis is going to be better and why? Martin Mucci : Jim, I think it's going to be steady, I think that the optimism that I see comes from - if you look at the optimism indexes like NFIB and so forth, they're very strong. I mean they continue a historical highs of people in small businesses saying, hey, I am looking to hire and my issue is, I just can't find the right people for the positions. And so we certainly continue to see that whether it's low unemployment rate, and the wages aren't going up quite as fast as you'd expect either, still hanging around 2.6% to 2.7% wage increase. But there is a lot of optimism there, people are looking to hire and there is job growth, it's just moderated and we're still getting job growth and we're still getting a lot of optimism. So, we're pretty optimistic and what we'll continue to see, it isn't going to be huge growth because we've come back from the recession slowly and that job growth is moderated, but there is still job growth. Operator : And our next question is coming from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Your line is now open. Ashwin Shirvaikar : I guess my question was just going back to the idea of longer-term operating margin expansion. Could you size the level of investment you're making this year and future margin expansion, is it as simple as that incremental opportunistic investment phases out or are there other factors that you can point to with regards to maybe pricing or other factors that you can point too that help margin expansion? Efrain Rivera : Yes, Ashwin, I'd say that what we said was and discussed back at the beginning of the year, we said that we'd invest between 33% and 50% of the benefit accruing from tax reform, that's what's contemplated in our numbers, and over time that will phase down. There will be some probably incremental IT spending that will remain from those projects, but if we execute appropriately that will be offset by savings in other areas of the business and also better revenue growth. So, I don't have a specific cadence that I'll give you because we need to walk through the year, look at the payoff on those projects. But we know exactly where we would take costs out if we don't think that the projects are generating the returns that we expect. And we know how to leverage, that's not difficult for us. This is a year where we decided it was more appropriate given the ability we had to invest more heavily and see if it produce the kinds of returns that we anticipate it will. I would say early on we feel comfortable that we're getting those returns, but we'll walk through the year and then see how the projects progress. Martin Mucci : Yes, we're following it very closely and as we've said, we really came out better stronger on the operating margin than we originally thought this year, and think that - and as Efrain mentioned, we do know how to leverage. So, we're watching closely to say, are we on track coming out of '19, for '20 what else do we need to do. We're kind of watching that and we are pleased that all of the investments that we're making are on track, and we believe that that, as Efrain said, will bring both revenue growth and expense reductions as well. They're across the board in both service and in product acceleration as well. So, we're pleased with the investments we made, we think frankly we came out stronger this year than we originally had expected when we first looked at tax reform. Once we tightened up all the numbers and what we were investing in, we feel good they're the right things and we'll get back to margin expansion exactly the timing is more difficult because of the investments and getting everything done. But we certainly feel that, as we have said, that we'll be back on the margin expansion right. Ashwin Shirvaikar : So, safe to assume based on that statement that, that is you're seeing early signs of sales productivity increases, retention, improvements, things like that. That would be matrix that we can look forward to as you make these investments, right? Efrain Rivera : Yes, but I wouldn't say that the improvements in client retention and sales productivity and sales performance that we just mentioned are not necessarily, they're not driven by those investments because those investments just started. But we certainly feel positive about the investments we're making; we'd give you a better view of that six months from now as we get a little further into the investments. But, we feel like at this point they're certainly on track and then we just started the incremental and the additional accelerated investments in the last quarter. Ashwin Shirvaikar : Absolutely, and can I just ask the strong growth in PEO, what would you attribute that to, is there some share gain in there that you're thinking about or just higher demand for comprehensive outsourcing, can you color that? Martin Mucci : I think, one very good sales execution, our integration with HROI and the team there, with our excellent team I think can really get it a great point, at the same time there is just a huge demand for more HR support. When you think about, while you think that Federal regulations I've mentioned before coming down, there is a tremendous amount of state regulations that are going up, there is all the issues with immigration, there is the entire issue of harassment, I mean everything is driving more HR concerns and risks, particularly for small businesses that don't have the expertise, small to midsize businesses and that's fitting very well into the PEO business when you tie that into our insurance experience as well. So, I think it's very strong demand in that marketplace and a very good execution from our sales and service teams. Operator : And our next question is coming from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Kartik Mehta : I just wanted to understand little bit about FY '19, I think Marty, you said that you would anticipate client growth coming back in FY '19 but organic growth and the payroll side is going to be I think around 1.5% let's say. So, I'm wondering are there some changes happening or do you think it'd be less price? Just to better understand client growth versus organic growth expectations for FY '19 Martin Mucci : Yes, probably a little bit less on the price. I think as you see it particularly on the small end, it continues to be very competitive, I mean we're feeling very good about the product offerings that we have in introducing, consistently innovating with do-it-yourself handbooks and paperless onboarding and our Paychex promise. But I think we're being a little more conservative on the fact that, okay, if we take a little less price, let's drive the client growth plus, and we're probably being conservative for how much we can do on the retention as well. We saw some improvement this year, things really quieted down on the service models and so we're getting more positive affirmation about 7/24 service and the dedicated not only payroll specialist but managers for the midsized. So, I think it's just a bit of that, and we've seen a mix change. So, as Efrain, has mentioned many times in the call over the last couple of years, we've seen a little bit of a mix of size of clients and so when you put all that together I think that's our overall guidance. Kartik Mehta : Efrain, just your thoughts on use of cash. Obviously, balance sheet just is flush with cash, you should generate a ton of cash again in FY '19. Is the thought that you want to wait for the right opportunity, maybe the acquisitions you're looking at, the prices change, or is it that there just aren't acquisitions that would fit kind of what you're trying to accomplish? Efrain Rivera : No, absolutely not. That\u2019s in just your question Kartik. So, I mean I had point to Lessor. So, Lessor, we were in discussions for multiple years on that asset and eventually pulled the trigger and bought it. Advance partners we were in discussions for multiple years on that asset and then bought it. The fact that we didn't pull the trigger and I'd say probably due to some extent even HROI we could say that. The fact that we don't pull the trigger in a given year, doesn't mean we're not in relatively advanced stages on discussions on assets that we think makes sense within our portfolio. So, I can say that we have acquisition targets that would use that cash, plus, very quickly if we thought that it makes sense to do it. So, I would say the pipeline is very flush with opportunities and I would anticipate over the next year that we'll have an opportunity to do other acquisitions if we think that the due diligence makes sense. And, by the way implicit in that statement is the fact that they already need some level of strategic fit based on our screening criteria. So, no, it's just really for us, timing has to be right, the numbers have to be right and sometimes we are very deliberate in our approach to doing it, but I think there's a pretty robust pipeline of opportunities out there. Operator : And our next question is coming from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Bryan Keane : Just want to ask about competition. How do you think competition has impacted you guys' financials? I know I think last quarter you talked a little bit about the midmarket being a little more competitive and then now little bit on the small end on pricing, but I'm just trying to figure out in the big picture given the years of experience you guys have, how do you feel that the competition is having an impact? Martin Mucci : Bryan, I would say it's been about -- it's about the same, I think as I mentioned the small probably putting a little more pressure on price on the small end, but not significantly too much different than what we've seen. And then on the midmarket I'd say it's about the same, there's no really new players there, and I would say that some of the innovations that we've made and some of the changes that we're doing right now in our sales model that we've started in the fourth quarter that will roll into the first quarter here, and the midmarket I think are helping us position well. So, we're pretty nimble about changing how we're going at it and I think we've found some things that we could be doing a little bit better in the midmarket, but I don't think -- I think product wise we have the most thorough and complete integrated product out there. It's not just payroll and HR that is integrated on a single employee record, but it's got, we're connected single way to 401(k) to HR, we have the largest HR generalist team out there, nearly 500 of them, all of everything positions us well for more competition, and I don't think most competitors have anything that's as complete as that. So, I think it's about the same and we should be doing better. Bryan Keane : And then you talked a little bit about future operating margin expansion. What about on the revenue side? What does the future long-term revenue growth look like? Does it look pretty similar to this fiscal year guidance? Efrain Rivera : I would say we'd like to see payroll service revenue higher than it is currently. So, we're working very hard to make that happen. On the HRS side, certainly double digits is where we expect to be and while I recognize that there's a lot of emphasis on payroll rightly so and it's competitive. PEO is doing very, very well, and we're very, very bullish, on how that business is doing and we see a long trajectory of growth on that business. I would say, and you can do the math, we had almost 20% work side employee growth, organic; that's excluding HROI, and I would say that probably ranks pretty high in terms of where we stand in the industry. We think we've got some momentum going there. So, we feel pretty good about double-digit and I think that we're working hard to get the payroll. We'll talk more about HCM, integrated HCM rather than just payroll, because I think that as Marty said that integrated suite is what we sell, not just payroll which frequently is just an allocation from that bundle. So \u2013 but we can do better and that's our expectation. Martin Mucci : Yes. I think that mid to high single-digits is what you know we've been talking about for at least eight years and I think if you look at the overall CAGR all together, it's over seven and we're trying to make sure if that solidly over that number over time. And we have lot of opportunity to do that. As Efrain said it's becoming much more of an HR play which is what we had expected and planned that our business would go. And that's why as he talks about the future of how that to report, it really is so much more about but not just payroll by itself but always payroll on HR or payroll HR 41K et cetera. So we're trying to you know, six to seven is the guidance. Now we're trying to we should get that little bit higher longer term to be in that mid to high single digits. Operator : And the next question is coming from Rick Eskelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Rick Eskelsen : The first one, and I'm sorry if I missed it, but I was wondering if you talk a little more about the composition of the float income outlook and sort of what you're expecting with balance especially with what I did this quarter? Efrain Rivera : So Fed just raised rates a little while ago and we've got two rates baked in the remainder of the calendar year. One in the fall and one at the end of the year that's what the guidance contemplates. We looked at the probability of rates and when it got pretty higher for the second raise. We concluded that in our guidance. So that's what we're expecting at this point. Nothing beyond that, although there is a chance obviously that rates could continue to rise after the end of this calendar year. Rick Eskelsen : And for the balance growth, I mean, I know, it seems like tax performance with Holdings impacted this quarter. Does that continue throughout most of next year? Efrain Rivera : You know, I'd say if anything it'll be flat to modestly up, that's where I think we're going to be. Rick Eskelsen : And then just you mentioned several times about how pleased you have been with the acquisitions especially with HROI and what seem like going on the PEO business. So wondering if you could just sort of talk a little bit more about what explicitly you've seen from HROI? Whether this has changed your appetite particularly in PEO for acquisitions and then just more broadly on the PEO market? Thank you. Martin Mucci : Yes. Sure. I think what we've seen is really a great fit from a culture standpoint and the synergies that we could get from our underwriting team with them. Also they have connections that we didn't have with. From a carrier standpoint when you put us together the synergies from the insurance carriers is very important and we see future opportunities with that as well. You have to have great plans obviously to grow in cities where we haven't been historically. And we're pretty bullish on the PEO marketing. Again, we were kind of one of the first in this business when you go back from an ASO perspective where there was not co-employment. And we were the - I believe only one out there that when you take all those ASO and PEO products we're servicing well over a million worksite employees. And as Efrain said we've seen a very solid double-digit growth again this year. Those needs are just becoming more and more difficult and small to midsize businesses are really struggling with state-by-state regulations with the harassment policies that they need to have in place to protect them. There's a lot of risk for them and when they hear risk they're ready to outsource. And when you going with a great insurance product is well they can add value to their employees which helps for the retention and engagement, it really is a great overall picture for us in the future. So, I think the market is very strong. Acquisition-wise we're constantly looking at that space. I think we know it very well. And as Efrain said we're always looking and ready to buy if the time is right and the value is right. Rick Eskelsen : Just one follow-up, just confirming on the dividend that the change in the timing. Is that just a one-year thing and as we look forward to next year should go back to sort of normal timing? Efrain Rivera : That's kind of a Board decision, Rick. So we accelerated one quarter, brought it forward. Martin, I don't have a clear answer on that one, but I think you probably could anticipate, we'll go back to the kind of the normal cadence. The board will ultimately decide that one. Operator : And the next question is coming from David Grossman of Stifel Financial. Your line is now open. David Grossman : I'm wondering if I can just follow-up on a couple questions that have been asked already. And one relates to the investments that you're making. I know that both of you have referenced some of things that you are doing. I was hoping if you give a little more detail behind some of the major initiatives and maybe help us understand those that you expect to favorably impact your revenue growth, and then those that you expect to favorably affect your longer-term leverage in the model? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think - David, its Marty. I can give a couple. I think if this is what you're looking for from the accelerated investments. One is the HR space and what you find is how you drive more flexibility for clients in our combined payroll and HR model. So whether that's from user interface flexibility, whether it's allowing them to do a lot more things that they want to do and then build the product kind of out the way they want it. So from a user interface they want things a certain way. You can have all the product functionality behind it but you can isolate by designing some of the software more from a UX and UI perspective and we're spending a lot of time on that. There is additional feature functionality, won't want to get too detail into that from a competitive standpoint. But I think you know we have a very full-featured HR and payroll solution that also integrates with insurance and 401(k), but we're finding that the clients always want more flexibility from that standpoint. They also want more self-service. So, you'll see - and this comes - this helps on both a service operations cost perspective and a sales perspective. More and more clients want their employees to do more themselves and the employees want to do more themselves. As you know a lot of the generation these days don't want to talk to anyone, but they certainly want to be able to chat. They want to be able to going in question, hey, can I change my address. Can I change this? Can I change my deductions? Can I look at this information? So we already have 25 different things that client's employees can do themselves, but we're trying to expand that list, which also takes pressure off of the operations and service teams to not answer the same old stuff, but to be more available for more detailed questions and more responsive to those. So, that is in general that's where these investment, some of these technology investments are really going. One, it increases the efficiency and service performance to the clients and their employees. And the other also just response and from a product standpoint to something that I think we're going to be able to sell much more of. And everything we design we've gone the mobile-first. Everything we design is mobile-first meaning that what you see your ability to do everything on your phone and we've made some significant investment in an agile approach to development in developing everything from mobile app which by the way is rated very close to a five out of five these days and we're feeling very good about that. So it's the whole way we've looked at the technology and accelerating the needs of accelerated and we felt this was a good opportunity to accelerate the development. Efrain Rivera : So, couple of others is built on that David. So the other two areas are in sales and marketing and operation. Sales is pretty simple. We're adding more salespeople particularly in small business and mid-market. We're also adding more salespeople in the PEO space more than we would. We typically would add 2% to 3% in a given year. We're accelerating the amount of sales add, salespeople adds there. And we are also significantly increasing our digital marketing spend there to drive a better result. And as Marty said, part of what we saw in Q4 was really good returns on that investment. And that we hadn't really started to healthy up the spending yet and we're optimistic about what that produces. So that's the sales and marketing bucket. You can titrate that up and down depending on what the results you get. And then on operations side there is a work that we're doing from an efficiency of the footprint perspective. That is part of the spent in next year, and also looking at ability to operate \u2013 I'm sorry to automate some of the - some of those functions in the backend and so we've got numerous projects that we think will produce both topline growth, Marty mentioned, the platform opportunities that help both sales and back office and then on the operations side that's more of an efficiency play. So, all three of those are we're working on. David Grossman : And thanks for the color on all those items. Let me ask one different question which it relates back to the PEO. WSC growth I think you said was about 19% organically. And I know HRS includes many different segments, but the category organically I think was growing around 8% to 9%, So, is that PEO organically will be growing 19% and if not if it's growing more in line with the overall category kind of 8% to 9%. Can help us understand why the unit growth is far exceeding the revenue growth? Efrain Rivera : So two pieces of that, so make sure that disaggregate is a little bit. So we say PEO, PEO is not HRS and PEO itself is not total worksite employees. As Marty mentioned PEO is a subset of our worksite employees. I think we'll post when we post the K that what our worksite employees served are. It's lower than 19% because ASO is in that number. So it'll be solid double digits but it won't be 19%. When we call our PEO we're calling out specifically a portion of HRS revenue, not all of HRS revenue. And so if I isolate just the PEO portion of the business excluding HROI because HROI obviously contributes but we exclude that. We're getting teens growth in PEO at this point. And you're getting worksite employee growth of about 19%. So you need to disaggregate some of the pieces of the business. So HRS growing at 17%, obviously you have to pull the pieces apart organically more in Q4 like 9%, but within that you got a PEO piece of the business that's growing pretty rapidly and we think that continues. So hopefully that makes -- that clarifies a bit. David Grossman : So just to clarify that; is it was the PEO worksite employee growth was in the teens? Or it was 19%? Efrain Rivera : 19%, and then revenue growth within the teens. So PEO revenue growth was between 10 \u2013 around 15%. David Grossman : And is there a dynamic that kind of, is that mix, is that pricing, what? Can you help us understand why those are different? Efrain Rivera : I think David it's really simple. It depends on the size of the clients you're signing up. So, smaller PEO worksite employees are smaller PEO client, you get more per client larger clients. We've signed a number of larger clients. You get less per worksite employee. That's really the dynamic. It's interesting when you step back and look at the business, think about PEO for second. The backbone of the PEO platform is flex within Paychex. That solution works really well in the PEO context. And we're doing very well there selling pretty large clients. And when we look at the market what we say is, there seems to be a growing number of mid-market clients who want to comprehensive outsource solution and that trends going to continue into the future. Now, as you go up market you get a little bit less per worksite employee than you do when you go on lower market. Operator : And our next question is coming from Jeff Silber of BMO. Your line is now open. Henry Chien : It's Henry Chien calling for Jeff. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just I was curious to just learn a little more about what you did to improve retention. And just hoping if you could provide a bit more color or just talk a little more about how - what's change in your sales strategy that you kind of alluded to at least for the upcoming sale season? Thanks. Efrain Rivera : Yes. I can't service what happen is that I mentioned last year in fiscal 2017, we went through quite a kind of a movement of client. So we're increasing the number of online clients and we changed our service model on how to handle call-in clients versus multi-product clients and the kind of normal payroll clients who are call-out clients. So we were moving different service teams around and therefore moving the clients around. And that caused some disruption that cost us probably a percent on the retention in 2017 and from an all-time kind of high. So then, as that settled out 2017 and we've kind of completed most of that. Then we started to see the retention calm down. The tenure of our senior pay -- of our payroll specialist, then our service givers across the board build up. Our tools got better when we got used to handling the different teams and everything started to come together. So really retention is improved and better in almost every category we have from payroll to 401(k), to insurance you name it we had a very good year in retention. And we think that will continue as things continue to calm down and we get better tenure in those teams. So we had a nice improvement this year. In promoter scores which we don't give out, but we saw an improvement there as well kind of across the board and the satisfactions that our clients have. From a sales perspective what we did was -- at the beginning of the year we had to go to market that as I said pulled some of the micro client. More and more clients as you know are searching online, reviewing our products and platforms, testing the product, comparing the product, and a lot of the sale is 60% complete particularly on the small end before they even get to a sales rep. So we were handling more of that inside and we were we build out a telesales team inside, expanded and we expanded quickly beginning of the year. The tenure wasn't there. The leads weren't quite where we thought they were. And as we refined our lead process during the first half of the year and built tenure and sales team that built a very good momentum in the second half of the year and now positions us very well going into June and this fiscal year, so that was the major change in sales. We have number of other things but those were the major change. Henry Chien : And any thoughts on in terms of your, I guess client target mix and any thoughts on moving beyond that kind of small micro sized businesses and is that sort of factor in the sales strategy? Efrain Rivera : Well, I mean, listen, our strategy is still really one to a 1000 and some above that, but that's our sweet spot and we have really - mostly the two sales teams that sell kind of up to 50 and then 50 to a 1000 or so, we would not be changing that strategy. But you're seeing like on the SurePayroll side they're growing very strong, the micro were refining how we handle kind of each market and maybe even changing the segments a little bit about what is a micro and what is a little bit larger and what's the over 50 kind of thing. So, but we're not changing the overall strategy. We're still very successful and with over 650,000 clients we're not looking to initially change what we're doing or change the market we're going after because we think we're very well-positioned to capture more of it. Operator : And your next question is coming from Mark Marcon of R.W. Baird. Your line is now open. Mark Marcon : Wondering if you can give us a little more color in terms of how you think the PEO space is going to evolve over the next three to five years particularly small versus large. Where you think the penetration is now and where do you think it's going to go, because there has been a lot of emphasis on that. What the acquisition opportunities are like? And just how you're thinking about the space generally? And then I want to come back and just ask one margin question with regards to guidance and just making sure we understand it on an apples-for-apples basis? Martin Mucci : I think on the PEO space, obviously we're very bullish on and we been in it a long time. And we also like the ASO or PEO and I think what we've learned to do is kind of transition between \u2013 we're one of the few that can transition between what the client wants. What we have found is probably an increased acceptance of PEO over the last year or so. So as you have very good insurance plans in our markets that we're in there is much more acceptance of the co-employment and the PEO kind of structure in those states, and from an insurance carrier perspective. I think ACA pushed a lot of that you know in what stays and what goes of ACA almost doesn't matter at this point, but when it started, it got a lot more clients and prospects looking at insurance and whether to bundle that in and that feeling has stayed. With insurances, the other thing that I would say is helping the PEO and insurance side is the very low unemployment rate, the tough labor market makes it that more and more small businesses, small to midsize businesses want and need to have insurance to recruit and engage their employees. You're seeing that while the wage increases have not gone up as much as we would think in a tight labor market benefits have and that includes health insurance. So I think the PEO market is continue - is really we think could continue to grow for many years. And it's really - don't think of it so much as the co-employment has the ability to provide total HR support including insurance needs from a very tight relationship and service model. So, we feel very good about it. That's why we're continuing to grow. From an acquisition standpoint, we know the opportunities that are out there. We got to look at them very carefully. We think we've done that. And if the right opportunity comes up we'll be ready - I think we'll be very ready to go that way. Mark Marcon : Where do you think that penetration is Marty in terms of just thinking about it more holistically in terms of both on the small and medium size business range in terms of like what percentage of the - what you view is being the addressable market has been - has actually gone to a more holistic HR outsourcing including the insurance component? Martin Mucci : I think it's pretty small. And I think it's continuing - the acceptance as I mentioned is continuing to grow. So I think the opportunity is growing and the level that\u2019s been penetrated is pretty small. For years a lot of it was selling, PEO to PEO, so if somebody already had a PEO you could sell them from a competitor or something on that. What we've started to see I'd say in the last year and half, again I think ACA really pushed some of this forward was more and more client saying, hey I have to have insurance. It's also a recruitment and engagement tool for employees. And so I think that that's going to continue to grow. In the acceptance of it as that grows and other clients here that you have a PEO, okay I'm not as concerned about what co-employment means. And by the way the ASO side of our business is doing very well, is well. So we have both those opportunities. If you're not exactly - remember with our Paychex's insurance agency which is the 21st largest in the country, hey, if you don't want to go, if you're not a good risk for the PEO from an underwriting standpoint, we could transfer you over to the Paychex insurance agency and look for an opportunity for you there and still serve you with an HR generalist which is really the greatest benefit of the whole thing is having HR person who's there to support you. And we've expanded that service model. For example, if you look at the Workplace by Facebook, one of the great benefits is not just that in Facebook, in Workplace you can gain information on your check stubs, and your 401(k) balance, but you can ask questions to the HRG while you're in Workplace by Facebook. So we're trying to expand that service model of the HR generalist as well. Mark Marcon : And then related question would just be, there's more pass-through. So I'm just trying to understand when we take a look at like the - in the presentation that you posted we're looking on the operating margin for FY '18 of 38.2, the guidance is towards 37. When we think about just the year-over-year transition, how much of it is due to investments versus how much of it is due to mix, just because you've got more pass-through expenses coming through? Efrain Rivera : The mix - I'm sorry, the mix, Mark is modest at this point. If PEO starts to accelerate significantly beyond where it is, it's going to start to affect more of a drag. But you're going to get better revenue growth. For next year it's more driven by the investments, there's a little bit of impact based on mix. Mark Marcon : And then just the cadence was asked about earlier, but I mean should it go back to kind of the normal sort of leverage that we would typically end up seeing or is the mix going to impact that\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Well, it depends on the growth rates for PEO, Mark. So part of what we're talking about giving additional disclosures, we'll give you some insight into that. We think we still can leverage at least at current growth rates for the PEO if that would just significantly increase from where it is now then obviously that's going to impact margins but you're going to get better growth. So it's a little bit of six of one and half a dozen of another. Mark Marcon : Can I sneak one more in the Paychex's Promise? Are you taking much risk on in there? Efrain Rivera : Well, we don't think so, because we're - the client has to go through a review process. And so while we think that - and it\u2019s a very quick process, but we are reviewing what that risk is. But we feel that it's the kind of insurance for the client particularly then the small side that have cash flow issues that worry about that two days or five days or seven days that they might have an issue, that we think this is something that given our size and financial strength that we can do, but we're doing it very carefully. Martin Mucci : We've run it through a lot of credit algorithms, Mark, so we keep up pretty close eye on it. Operator : And your next question is coming from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tien- tsin Huang : Just wanted to ask on the - given on the success and demand for comprehensive outsourcing and PEOs, you've talked about a lot. Is that stealing incrementally from traditional payroll or maybe even do-it-yourself. Just to try and understand how you might think about the secular theme there? Martin Mucci : Well I think - I don't think so much from do-it-yourself, I think from midsize payroll it definitely I think could be taking some share from there because that's where its expanding for the most part. If you have 20 - 15 to 20 employees and up, that attractive to you, and so it certainly could be taking from payroll only, but again we're here to offer whatever the client needs in a full sweet basis, if they want full PEO that's fine. And that is certainly growing faster than the midsize payroll only or payroll plus just HR. Tien- tsin Huang : So from a resourcing standpoint including inorganic investments then, I mean, would your risk appetite then go up maybe on the PEO side or maybe just to be little bit more aggressive on the distribution, just trying to understand how you are balancing that, the risk versus the growth? Efrain Rivera : You mean from an acquisition kind of standpoint or\u2026? Tien- tsin Huang : From an acquisition standpoint or even organically, if you want to expand what you've done in Florida? Martin Mucci : I mean, we've really already expanded. I mean, we sell pretty much nationwide, obviously the largest concentration is in those states where it's most popular Florida, Texas, Georgia, but HROI is assisted in that well as we have gone even more national. And when you look at acquisitions and you look at investment you do try to get some sort of scale in certain areas so that you can have better insurance carrier relationships and plans as well. Efrain Rivera : Yes. So Tien-tsin you asked two questions related to risk. One, Marty answered with respect to both kind of the appetite for broader business development and the appetite for PEO. The answer is yes. The appetite with respect to underwriting though, we're really tied on that and my appetite for risk is pretty low. In that sense, I think you can underwrite good business. We have very, very stringent controls on that and a lot of reviews on the state of both the [MPP] and the workers comp portions of the portfolio. So yes, it\u2019s a little bit more balance kind of answer to the question. Martin Mucci : Yes, definitely. On the underwriting we've always been extremely tight on that and feel like we're at very good place and continue to do that. And again with that balance of risk, we always have the insurance agency and the ASO product to say, if you're not a good fit there and we don't want underwrite this, we do have an insurance agency with multiple other plans that can usually get you the insurance that you need. Operator : And the last question is from James Fossett of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. James Fossett : I just want to ask, you mentioned that employment or pace of new employment has been slowing as the market tightens. I'm wondering what are the things that Paychex is doing or it's adjusting to try to help its customers better attract employees, you've referenced that a couple of times, but I'm wondering if you can give some specific examples. And then how well do you think those kinds of assistances can carry into when the market maybe isn't so - the employment market isn't so tight? Martin Mucci : Well, I think, yes, it's even more important now that it is tight, right? So, what we've been able to do is, we have over 500 HR generalist. So, if you buy our ASO or PEO product and you have an HR person, lot of these small to midsize businesses do not have a full-time HR person. They don't know how to recruit necessarily, and what we can do is help them with recruiting, we can help them on how to build the job description, how to recruit out, how to on-board and retain and engage employees. That's where a lot of the benefit of that HR person comes from who has multiple clients by the way and can use that data and that experience to help small and midsize businesses. The biggest issue for businesses today right now is finding and hiring, recruiting and hiring the right people for their jobs, and that's where we actually, the HR person that we have can help them a great deal. Also from a product standpoint when you think about it, being able to have an easy way to take prospect information ,so I want to go work for your small business, if you're with Paychex's, you can go online, do that without - paperlessly, that transcends over into the business, they can review those resumes that are all online, all paperless. And if you get hired, it's a paperless experience to bring you on. And, then of course that transcends into a mobile app which you can show the new employees to say, hey, we're modern, we're with Paychex's, you have a mobile app, you can get your pay, your pay stubs, change your 401(k) et cetera is all here. So, I think frankly it's been very appealing to businesses that are struggling to hire to use someone like us and our products and our services. James Fossett : And so, I guess it's real more of an emphasis on what Paychex's can already deliver rather than you introducing any new capabilities. Does it make sense for you to look at adding additional or are there things that you can add to help in that recruitment employment process? Martin Mucci : Well, sure, I think it's always - there's always more things that we can do, what's the best way to recruit, how is that being done, things like video interviewing, right. So, we can partner up with someone who can help a small business, who can never afford to do kind of video interviews, which is very popular, becoming more and more popular now, right. So, I don't want to necessarily commend that, if I want to recruit, you do a short video, you send that with your resume which is all paperless. We continue to look to evolve those HR support products to give you the best ability to recruit and hire and retain the very best employees. So, we're constantly looking at ways to do that and do it in a also a digital way, much more through chat bots and artificial intelligence, and also give you data analytics, right. So, when you think about as a midsize client that has data analytics on what your turnover is, where your turnover is, how it compares to other businesses, those kind of things are good tools that can help businesses that wouldn't normally have that available to them. Operator : And speakers, we show no questions in queue at this time. Martin Mucci : All right, I'm going to talk about your follow up call. Efrain Rivera : That's okay, just close and then\u2026 Martin Mucci : At this point we'll close the call. If you're interested in replaying this webcast of this conference call, it'd be archived for approximately 30 days. And I do thank you for your continued participation in our fourth quarter press release call and for your interest in investment in Paychex. Efrain Rivera : For those of you who want to talk about ASC 606, we should have posted the presentation to the website, hop on the call in about five minutes or so, and we'll walk through that in about half an hour. So, it will be a primer on all things, ASC 606. I look forward to having the conversation. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Thank you, everyone. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I will turn the conference over to your host Martin Mucci. Please go ahead. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Sorry for our slight delay there. Just a little bit of issues on conferencing, but we will get started now. Thank you for joining us for our discussion for the Paychex first quarter fiscal 2019 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. And this morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2018. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet, will be archived and available on our website for about 1 month. On today\u2019s call, I will review the business highlights for the first quarter. Efrain will review our first quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal 2019. Then we will open it up for your questions. We have had a good start for fiscal 2019 and our financial results reflect growth across our major product lines. Our total revenue growth was a solid 9% for the first quarter. Beginning this quarter, we are changing from our traditional disclosures, as Efrain talked about last quarter, of the service revenue categories of payroll and human resource services and are now reporting service revenues as management solutions revenues or PEO and insurance services revenues. This new revenue disaggregation provides a better representation of how our business has evolved to the selling of more bundled products and Efrain will provide more information about this in his commentary. You may recall last fiscal year we implemented certain go-to-market strategies for sales, which began to gain momentum in the back half of the year. That momentum has continued for the first quarter, especially to HR outsourcing services both in our PEO as well as our traditional ASO/HCM service bundle. We have also continued to add to our sales force and are fully staffed as we head into our upcoming peak selling season. With regards to the client retention in the first quarter, we are very pleased with the continued increase in this metric for retention as well as our strong client satisfaction performance. August 18 was the anniversary of our acquisition of HR Outsourcing Holdings, Inc., or HROI, a national PEO. HROI continues to perform well and has integrated very well into the existing PEO sales and service organization of Paychex. We also acquired Lessor Group, a payroll and HR services provider headquartered in Denmark at the end of February 2018. Lessor is performing well and we are enthusiastic about the growth opportunities that these acquisitions provide us. At the HR Tech Conference in September, we premiered our Paychex brand refresh, which focuses on the power of simplicity. This renews our commitment to our customers to make their lives easier by alleviating the complexity of payroll, HR, benefits, and insurance. Paychex has over four decades of experience working with businesses to solve their complex challenges. And everything we do is focused on making it simpler for our clients to run their businesses through a combination of our leading technology, our breadth of product offerings and our personalized service options. At HR Tech, we also introduced Paychex Learning Management, a web-based learning management system that provides employers with a simple and affordable learning tool. Paychex Learning Management features access to hundreds of preloaded learning modules, allows clients to create their own new materials, and upload existing training material specific to their industry or workforce. It is also integrated with our performance management solution, which recently underwent a user experience update. In our current environment of record low unemployment and award for talent, employers need every advantage they can to get for recruiting and retaining employees and our comprehensive suite of HR products can help employers recruit with attractive benefit package and our new LMS offering helps with the retention of talent by providing ongoing engagement and professional development. We also showcased additional new enhancements and features within our HR product suite. We now offer tablet-enabled facial recognition for time and attendance and the new Paychex Flex Assistant, a chatbot for commonly asked HR related questions. These are examples of our ongoing commitment to continually introduce advancements in technology that evolves and enhances our clients\u2019 experience and makes it more valuable to them across all of our services. We are pleased with our progress in retirement services for the eighth consecutive year. Paychex was named by PLANSPONSOR Magazine as the leader in total number of defined contribution plans as we now serve well over 80,000 plans. Paychex Retirement Services meets the needs of businesses of all sizes by delivering next level efficiency with full Paychex HCM integration, fee transparency, plan accessibility across devices, flexibility in investment options and fiduciary solutions and personalized participant support. We also ranked number 20 as the 20th largest business insurance agency in 2018 in their top list of 100 brokers in the U.S. This is up 1 spot from last year. This is our eighth time on this list as well and is a testament to our best-in-class insurance agents who continue to deliver customized solutions to meet the evolving needs of business owners and their employees. Value-rich insurance coverage plays a key role in both hiring and keeping key talent. I would also like to note that for the sixth consecutive year, we were recognized by Selling Power Magazine as one of its 50 best companies to sell for, in fact ranking number 3. We have been making significant investments in our sales force, including new technology support tools and more sophisticated demand generation to improve the quantity and quality of the sales leads to support our sales force and their success. We continue to also provide value to our shareholders. Our quarterly dividend is currently at $0.56 per share, with a last increase of 12% this past April. In summary, our state of art technology full suite of integrated HCM product offerings and personalized service is a powerful combination that positions us for sustainable growth in our markets. Our employees make this combination successful with their hard work and commitment to our clients each and every day. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the first quarter. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Marty and good morning. I would like to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings release that includes a discussion of forward-looking statements and related risk factors. In addition, I will periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These measurements include certain discrete tax items and one-time charges. Please refer to the press release and investor slide presentation for a discussion of these measures. The investor slide presentation should be up and it\u2019s got a lot of supplemental information on it. As mentioned previously, effective for this fiscal year, we have adopted a new revenue recognition guidance in ASC Topic 606. We have adopted under the full retrospective method. So prior year results have been restated to conform with this guidance. After our previous earnings call in June, you\u2019ll recall that I held a supplemental call to introduce the impacts of this new guidance on our financial results. On our IR page, we have published an updated presentation from that call and that gives quarterly information on the financial impacts of ASC 606 and other non-GAAP adjustments for the past 2 years. Overall, the changes from adoption of the accounting standard are not significant, but they do have a modest effect on the quarterly periods. This presentation also reflects the impact of tax reform and non-GAAP measures. In connection with the adoption of the new guidance, the categorization of our service revenues is evolving. In prior years, we disaggregated service revenue into two buckets, payroll service revenue and human resource services revenue. As our business has evolved to selling more bundled products, this disaggregation has become less meaningful. ASC 606 requires disaggregation of revenues to reflect how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are impacted by economic factors. Given how we manage our business and the risk inherent in various services, we have decided that a more meaningful presentation is the categories of management solutions revenue and PEO and insurances revenue. Management solutions revenue includes payroll and HR and employee benefits products that are better reflective of offerings in our product bundles. So, this presentation includes our previous category of payroll services together with retirement services and HR administration solutions, including our comprehensive ASO service bundle. This presentation represents our integrated HCM services. PEO and insurance services revenues have similar operational economic characteristics. Both involve the provision of insurance benefits to clients. PEO revenues also reflect a gross up for certain of our insurance offerings to PEO clients. During this transition period, I want to emphasize this will provide information on service revenues under both our previous and new classification. So, you will have that information. You will have the ability to adjust your models as you go forward. And there is information on our Investor Relations site. It provides both as reported disaggregation of revenue, payroll and HRS and the revised disaggregation of revenue management solutions and PEO and insurance services for the past few years. Now with that preface out of the way, I will provide some of the key highlights for the quarter and then provide greater detail in areas. And as usual, I will touch briefly on the results and wrap up with the review of fiscal \u201819 outlook. Total revenue and services grew 9% for the first quarter to $863 million and $846 million respectively. The growth was aided by the acquisitions of HROI and Lessor, more to come on those. Expenses increased 14% for the first quarter. The acquisitions of HROI and Lessor together contributed approximately 6% to the total expense growth for the first quarter. Accelerated investment in sales, marketing and product development as part of tax reform investments and PEO costs were major factors in expense growth. Operating income increased 1% to $320 million. Operating margins were 37.1% for the first quarter. Margins were impacted by acquisition expenses, increased investment initiatives, higher growth and PEO costs and the composition of payroll processing days. Our effective income tax rate was 24.5% for the first quarter compared to 34.1% for the respective prior year quarter. The significant decline year-over-year in the effective tax rate is of course due to tax reform legislation. We anticipate that the effective tax rate will be approximately 24% for the remainder of the year. Net income increased 16% to $244 million for the first quarter and adjusted net income increased 18% to $242 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 16% to $0.67 for the first quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 18% to $0.67. I will provide some additional color now in selected areas and start with a discussion of service revenues and we will discuss results under our previous categories and our new service revenue categories. Under our previously reported categories of service revenue, payroll services revenue growth was 1% for the first quarter in line with our expectations. Organic growth related to pricing for the first quarter was offset by the impact of client size mix and the composition of payroll processing days within the quarter. If you recall in June, I indicted that payroll revenue growth for Q1 would be below the low end of the range of our guidance. HRS revenues grew 18%, approximately 12% excluding the HROI acquisition. This growth is due to the growth in clients across our HR products, in particular Paychex HR Services, ASO and PEO, and retirement services. Now, let\u2019s talk about management solutions revenue. This includes as I discussed previously payroll service revenue together with other HCM products included in many of our product bundles. Management solutions revenue increased 3% to $688 million for the first quarter. This increase was driven by growth in client bases across our HCM services, including payroll, ASO, retirement services, and time and attendance solutions. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in the asset value participants\u2019 funds. The acquisition of Lessor contributed less than 1% to this growth. The growth was partially offset by the impact of unfavorable composition of payroll processing days in the first quarter compared to the prior year quarter, same thing that I mentioned on payroll. PEO and insurance services revenue increased 39% to $158 million for the first quarter. We acquired HROI near the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The incremental impact of HROI accounts for approximately one half of this growth. The remaining growth was primarily driven by continued strong demand for our combined PEO services as we continue to experience strong growth in the number of client worksite employees. In addition, our insurance services revenue benefited from growth in the number of applicants. Interest on funds held for clients grew 25% for the first quarter to $17 million primarily as a result of higher average interest rates earned. And just to pause there for a second, we have assumed that there would be Fed rate increases in this fiscal \u2013 there will likely be more, but we only included two in our plan. The first occurred this or last month I should say and we anticipate there will be one more at least that\u2019s what\u2019s contemplated in our plans. As we get to midyear, we will talk a little bit more about what our expectation is based on where the Fed is at that point. Turning to our investment portfolio, our goal as always is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. And the short-term side, primary short-term investment vehicles were bank demand deposit accounts and variable rate demand notes. In our longer term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipals bonds, corporate bonds, and U.S. government agency securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.9%. Average duration is 3.1 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.8% for the first quarter, up from 1.4% last year. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients were down modestly for the first quarter, primarily driven by the impacts of tax reform and client employee withholdings partially offset by wage inflation. I will now walk through our thoughts on our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $788 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients were $3.8 billion compared to $4.7 billion as of May 31, 2018. Funds held for clients vary widely as you know on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.7 billion for the first quarter. Our total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized losses of $36 million as of August 31, 2018 compared with $38 million as of May 31, 2018. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $2.4 billion as of August 31, 2018 reflecting $201 million in dividends paid and $33 million of shares repurchased during the first quarter. Our return on equity for the past 12 months has been a stellar 45%. Please note that our return on equity calculation was adjusted to reflect the impacts of the adoption of ASC 606. At fiscal 2018 year end, we reported 46% return on equity, which would be actually 44% on a restated basis, because of those changes made by ASC 606. Cash flows from operations were $274 million for the first quarter. It was a decline versus the prior year quarter. The change was primarily a result of timing impacts within working capital largely related to income taxes and our PEO payroll and related unbilled receivables for payrolls not yet processed as of the reporting date offset by higher net income. Fiscal 2019 guidance. Now, I will turn to guidance for the upcoming fiscal year ending May 31, 2019. I will remind you that our outlook is based upon our current view of economic conditions continuing with no significant changes. Our guidance for fiscal 2019 is unchanged from what was provided in June, which was given reflecting adoption of ASC 606. Under our previous revenue categories, there is no change to payroll revenue guidance in the range of 2% to 3% and HRS revenue guidance in the range of 10% to 11%. Payroll services revenue was below the low end of the range in the first quarter as anticipated due to the composition of payroll processing days. Growth in payroll revenue will be at or above the high end of the range for Q2 and Q3 and Q4 is anticipated to be within the range. HRS revenue growth for the first quarter was significantly higher than the range due to the timing of the HROI acquisition. Growth for Q2 and Q3 is anticipated to be within the range. For Q4, growth is anticipated to be below the low end of the range due to a more challenging compare caused by the strong growth in the PEO in the latter part of fiscal 2018. We will also provide you with revenue guidance under our new categories as we transition to this approach in the future. Management solutions revenue is anticipated to grow by approximately 4% for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018. Our Q1 results were obviously lower than this due, as I mentioned before, to the composition of payroll processing days. We anticipate that Q2 and Q3 will be above 4% and we anticipate that Q4 will be in line with the full year guidance. PEO and insurance services revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of 18% to 20%. Growth in the first quarter was obviously significantly higher due to the timing of the HROI acquisition. We anticipate that growth for Q2 and Q3 will be in the range of 15% to 17% and for Q4 in the range of 11% to 13% due to the factors that I mentioned before, i.e., a challenging comparison with strong PEO growth in the latter part of fiscal 2018. All other guidance remains unchanged. Finally, just as a reminder, we have provided on our IR website a presentation entitled service revenue disaggregation, which reflects historical revenues as originally reported and as they would be under the new categories. We have also published an updated presentation entitled impacts of ASC 606 and other items that reflects the impacts of adoption of 606 and other non-GAAP adjustments for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018. And with that, I will turn it now back to Marty. Martin Mucci : Alright. Thank you, Efrain. Operator, we will now open up the call to questions please. Operator : Okay. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. One moment. Please go ahead, Mr. Keane. Bryan Keane : Hi, guys. Can you hear me now? Martin Mucci : Yes, we can, Bryan. Bryan Keane : Yes, solid results. Just want to ask about the margins, they came in a little bit better than expected and wondering if they had to do with some timing of investments, because I think the full year operating margins were reiterated? Martin Mucci : Yes, Bryan, I would say that investments in Q1 were a little bit lower \u2013 they were planned that way, so this wasn\u2019t different, investments were a little bit lower in first quarter than they will be in subsequent quarters. That was one. And then revenue was a little bit better than we had originally anticipated in the quarter, so the combination of those two drove margins a bit better than we anticipated. Bryan Keane : Okay. And then just in particular on ASO and PEO strength, it looks like that those trends continue, in particular, just curious if there are any callouts? And then Efrain, when we get towards the end of the year, I know it gets a little more challenging on comps. So does that mean that 11% to 13% is a more normalized range for the PEO business and insurance business as we go forward past this fiscal year? Efrain Rivera : Bryan, I knew when I put out that number in those ranges just so everybody could be centered I would get that question. I don\u2019t know the answer to that at this point. I think I will talk to that as we get closer to Q2 and Q3. We had an exceptionally strong back half of the year. So I will have to see we have some momentum in PEO and we have a degree of conservatism in the way we look at the information. So, I will hold out on commenting whether that\u2019s the run-rate going into next year. Your first question was any callouts on PEO I will just let Marty. Martin Mucci : Yes, I think just \u2013 Bryan just that we continue as we said \u2013 as Efrain just said we had a strong back half of last year that continued right into the first quarter. We are finding a lot of success with the PEO and ASO both from an HR outsourcing perspective and the integration with HROI has gone very well and frankly has complemented us and our teams and the leadership I think very well. So, we have really picked up, continue to have some great momentum in the first quarter. So right now, the callouts are that there is a great need for the PEO and the ASO products and we are capturing the sales for that need. So, we are very pleased with the work that those guys have been doing. Bryan Keane : Okay, helpful. Thanks for taking the questions. Martin Mucci : Sure. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Please go ahead. David Grossman : Thank you. Good morning. Martin Mucci : Hi, David. David Grossman : Thanks for taking my question. I am wondering if you could go back to the PEO for a minute and I don\u2019t know if you can break just focus on the PEO excluding the other insurance business, but can you help us understand the components of the growth that you are anticipating for this year broken down, how much of that is unit growth versus pass-through versus maybe pricing and other items that maybe impacting the growth rate year-over-year? Efrain Rivera : David, here is what I\u2019d say, the \u2013 what we are experiencing is strong growth in worksite employees that continued in the first quarter. So, it\u2019s not primarily pricing-driven, it\u2019s really much more driven by volume of clients. So we\u2019re not \u2013 and we\u2019re not anticipating any significant stat up \u2013 step-up, I\u2019m sorry, in the rate of attach on healthcare. So it\u2019s not that getting a little bit more contribution from pass-throughs, it\u2019s really more volume-driven. And I got a lot of calls or we got a lot of questions about whether our worksite employee growth was real or how real it was and how sustainable more than that not how real, and we had strengthened the back half of the year and that that\u2019s continuing as we start the year. Martin Mucci : Yes. I think you can really see it in the \u2013 because when you think about it, the worksite employee growth is double digits as well, so it\u2019s continued to be very strong, not only the sales of \u2013 from new sales, but also the existing basis is continuing to grow. So, we\u2019re getting a little uptick on the economy from those slightly larger businesses, I guess I\u2019d say mid-market size PEO client. Efrain Rivera : And David one of the thing that I\u2019d like to add because this is probably not what was true five or six years ago. We get a lot of PEO clients outside of the base. So, when you see the growth, a lot of that\u2019s coming from outside the Paychex PEO bay \u2013 sorry, Paychex payroll base. So, we\u2019re winning both inside the base and outside the base. David Grossman : And just to confirm since you \u2013 the way you just disclosure is set up, the actual of this WSE growth that you\u2019re quoting now is actually an organic number, right, because you had HROI at the end of last \u2013 from fiscal first quarter last year as well, correct? Efrain Rivera : WSE growth or revenue growth? Martin Mucci : Worksite employee growth. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Martin Mucci : Yes. David Grossman : WSE growth. Efrain Rivera : Yes, I\u2019m sorry. Martin Mucci : The organic is double-digits. Efrain Rivera : Yes, yes, correct. David Grossman : Right, got it. Okay, great. And then just to \u2013 you gave us some good guidance on the growth and the cadence as the year goes by. Do processing days normalize at all as the year goes on or is that just this year or one quarter-ish with no real impact through the balance of the year? Efrain Rivera : Well, we never recover that one heavy processing day and the impact on payroll services revenue is about $5 million from that one day. So we never recover it and then you have kind of the normal ups and downs you might have in a given quarter, which is why the other quarters looks so different from Q1. David Grossman : Alright. So just 1Q is the $5 million and nothing else through the balance of the year? Efrain Rivera : Yes, just to be clear since I get this question. We\u2019re not saying there is one less day, it\u2019s really just the composition of a heavier processing day in Q1 that we lost and then the rest of the year is normal, which will mean you got some a little bit more in one quarter, a little bit less in other quarters and \u2013 but it will look like a normal year. David Grossman : Got it. And then just one last quick question on the competitive dynamic. You know one of kind of non-traditional competitor came out with a kind of revised payroll solution during the quarter, I think it\u2019s been out there, so it\u2019s really not terribly new. But, I guess the reason I bring it up is that in the past point-of-sale usually goes in the small business before payroll and I\u2019m just curious whether how you\u2019re thinking about that if in fact the point-of-sale competitor comes in with a stronger solution and how that may impact you given that typically is the \u2013 the cash register if you will goes in before the payroll system? Martin Mucci : Yes, David, this is Marty. You\u2019re absolutely right. I mean that that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been and of course other competitors have been out there with those solutions for a while. This one is not a new one, a lot was made about it, and \u2013 but it\u2019s a mobile version of something they\u2019ve had for a number of years. It doesn\u2019t support all the states, it\u2019s not as complex obviously as close to our offering, you have to do payroll many days ahead. So, I don\u2019t at least in this instance I don\u2019t see it as any big change from a competitive standpoint. And you\u2019re right that in kind of that point-of-sale typically because we\u2019re selling \u2013 we are also selling through a partner those solutions, payment solutions. We find that, that is something that they take upfront and then payroll comes along a little bit later. So, we have experienced that ourselves. So, we can be selling it. We actually unseat more payment solutions, because they already have them before they ever talk about payroll with us. So, we don\u2019t see that as a big change at this point. Again, a number of competitors have been out there and this one really wasn\u2019t that big of a change or anything close to the competitiveness that we have. It\u2019s a mobile payroll solution. It doesn\u2019t, I don\u2019t believe, even have employee access, which is what many companies are looking for now on a mobile basis. Efrain Rivera : And if I just more concretely beyond what \u2013 adding building on what Marty said, look, I mean, we have a really competitive offering in the micro-enterprise space and we will be talking as we go through the year about some really significant enhancements of that product that we think will put us certainly at the forefront of what\u2019s happening on the low end of the DIY SaaS part of the market. We are doing really well in that part of the business. It was really, really surprising to us, what the reaction that occurred as a result of that, because we don\u2019t see any of that in our numbers. As a matter of fact, in the past 6 months, we have been building momentum in that part of the market. So, everyone is entitled to make their own opinion as to what a press release makes. Unfortunately, from the standpoint of the facts, we are not seeing any impact. And so, I just want to make that very clear. David Grossman : Thanks for that. But I guess the follow-on related to that is does this change at all your appetite to be in the merchant acquiring business or has that really not changed? Efrain Rivera : No. I mean, we are selling and our sales have done very well. We have an inside team that sells through a couple of partners now and has continued to do well. But as far as getting into a full-fledged \u2013 doing the processing itself of the payments, I don\u2019t think so, there is not a great interest there. As you know, the company dynamics are very different. The financials are very different. And I don\u2019t think it makes a huge difference from the payroll side on the front-end. Frankly, we have had better experience with having the payroll and then unseating an existing competitor in the payment space, because those rates constantly are changing and we can give them a little bit better product. And frankly, sometimes it offsets the cost of payroll or other products. So, we are in it, but I think we are in it at the right level right now. David Grossman : Alright. Got it, great. Thanks very much. Martin Mucci : Thanks, David. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair. Please go ahead. Tim McHugh : Thanks. I guess two questions on the PEO business. I guess one is just somewhat of a follow-up. I guess, the WSE growth had double-digits versus the 19% I guess organic growth. It seems double-digits doesn\u2019t sound quite as high as 19%, so what\u2019s the kind of revenue per WSE, maybe talk about that in terms of that I guess driving incremental growth? I mean, I will top there first. Efrain Rivera : Yes. So we don\u2019t disclose the revenue per WSE number, Tim. We will talk to that as we go through the year. It doesn\u2019t sound impressive, because when we said organic was 19%, remember that the base now, including HROI, increases the number of WSEs. It\u2019s still pretty strong. So, I wouldn\u2019t take that as an implication that growth is somehow decelerating, because now when we talk about organic, we are talking about the inclusion of HROI in the base, which adds more WSEs. And so we are talking about a more apples-to-apples comparison. And then as we walk through the year, we will talk more about revenue per worksite employee. Tim McHugh : Is the implication of that last comment that I guess HROI wouldn\u2019t be growing as fast as your organic? Is that what you are saying now that it\u2019s rolled in\u2026 Efrain Rivera : No, the implication of that is that now you have got a larger base on which to calculate growth. So, the 19% was on the Paychex business itself. That was the organic comparison. And now we roll in the HROI base to our clients and so the growth rate obviously is a little bit lower, because you have a bigger base on which you are calculating the growth. Martin Mucci : Yes. And we didn\u2019t really mean to imply that double-digits means at the low end of double-digits. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Tim McHugh : Okay. And then, I guess a broader question just you are breaking PEO and insurance out into separate segment. I get it\u2019s somewhat driven by the revenue disclosures, but also even just this call, a lot of discussion of this business and you have talked about a lot of momentum in it. So, yet it\u2019s still a smaller piece relative to your business. I know it\u2019s been clearly an area of expansion. I guess should we read anything into I guess how important this is going to be strategically to Paychex in terms of your focus and where the investment dollars are going over the next 3 years given all those factors? Martin Mucci : Well, I think you certainly could read into it that we think that\u2019s an important part of our business going forward. The HR Outsourcing has been very important and the PEO has picked up momentum really the last 2 or 3 years in particular even from the client standpoint from accepting what a PEO is and understanding. The competition that\u2019s out there I think has also helped drive that, understanding that what a PEO is and how that can assist them. The changes in insurance have driven that. So, yes, I think you will see us continue to make investment in that business and we do think \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t break it out as a segment with insurance unless we thought it was certainly a significantly growing piece of the business. And it has different dynamics obviously to the financials that we like to call out as well. Tim McHugh : Okay, thank you. Maybe actually one more on that, the dynamics part, sorry to raise the question, just the margins on that side of the business, can you comment at all? Is it different versus the other segment as we think about the growth of that side of it? Efrain Rivera : Hey, Tim. So, we will talk more as this is the first quarter reporting on it. But obviously, because PEO is bundled with insurance or not bundled with insurance, but presented with insurance and PEO has pass-through costs, it\u2019s lower than the overall company margin and management solutions is higher. We will have to go through the year and kind of see where rates normalize, but it\u2019s fair to say it is lower than overall company margins. Tim McHugh : Okay, thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of James Fossett with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Fossett : Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow-up on the question related to kind of the crossover and you have made it clear that you feel like merchant acquiring, etcetera, is a different business. But I am wondering if there is opportunity or how you think about like the selling motion to continue to make sure that Paychex has the best opportunity to win the business where you do want it, especially as the way people are setting up new businesses, etcetera, seems to be changing? Martin Mucci : I hope I got the question. You mean specific to the payment business, payment with payroll? James Fossett : Yes, just as people are starting to think about it as they setup new business, especially smaller businesses that maybe looking for a one stop shop. And I can understand what you are talking about in terms of where merchant acquiring maybe doesn\u2019t fit within Paychex, but I think perhaps what people are expressing some concern about is like what that selling motion looks like or needs to look like, so you can get the best opportunity to win new business? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think \u2013 one, I think we are very much at the front-end. I would just say our experience has been that, with the payment solutions that we do a payment solution through two partners. We are I think very effective at it. That sales team has grown. It\u2019s all an inside team. So, we get referrals from the field and we have of course one of the largest field base selling teams out there in payroll and HR. And so when we run into brand new clients, we can certainly refer them back to that team to sell payment now and then build a relationship to payroll. But we also more times than not have payroll first and then unseat the payment solution. On the other hand, I would tell you that a lot of the work that we are doing now on the front-end is to be able to get at those clients where they come to us on the web. So, you are seeing a lot more web-based coming in through the web and then selling them whatever they need at that point, whether that\u2019s payment, payroll or a combination of that with HR. So, I think we are well positioned very much to get those businesses at the very much the front-end of when they are searching. And more of our dollars frankly have shifted to marketing and to web development and demand generation than any time in our history, because of that, because of the way the whole sales approach is. And Efrain mentioned, SurePayroll, a component of ours out of Chicago, obviously is also we are working on some things that we will be releasing and talking about the next quarter or two that I think will help that even more. Efrain Rivera : The other thing, as you know we have been involved with merchant services over the past 5 years and I think we have got a pretty good understanding of the dynamics of how that sale occurs and how it occurs with payroll. So, I think between SurePayroll and what we do on the merchant side, we are in a position to see if that starts to tilt or to tip and take the appropriate action. Right now though I just want to emphasize that we are not seeing that and a lot of the dynamics that we saw 5 years ago still remain and what happens in the future where we will monitor and see what\u2019s going on. James Fossett : Great. That\u2019s really reassuring. And I guess on your kind of online customer acquisition and referral efforts and what you are putting in there, any even qualitative color you can share with us about the effectiveness of that versus traditional sales force and maybe how that has been changing and what kind of further improvements you maybe able to make at least on what those metrics look like? Thanks. Efrain Rivera : Yes, sure. I think it\u2019s been a very significant change over particularly over the last year. We have moved more leads to a virtual team inside for the smallest of clients. Those were starting up 1 to 4. We use more of the virtual teams or telephonic sales, because that\u2019s the way the client in those small areas in particular, their leads come in, they want to be addressed very quickly. We have really become much more sophisticated in our lead generation in the way we are scoring leads and then communicating with prospects, who aren\u2019t ready to buy yet. Those used to all be kind of in the bucket with all the leads being the same that is not the way it\u2019s done anymore. We know when someone just comes in. We know where they start and stop looking at our product. They know if we have been compared to somewhere else. We know if they looked at pricing or not. And we can respond telephonically much faster with much better data targeted right at that client and we are setup to demo and sell over the phone or through chat very quickly. So the dynamics have changed quite dramatically, particularly for the inbound web search and low end client. And I think we have really \u2013 last year we kind of started this towards the beginning of the year actually in the fourth quarter of the year before and we really have picked up momentum in the last 6 months and I think we have really fine tuned the store, it\u2019s working very well. James Fossett : That\u2019s great color. Thanks guys. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jim Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe Marty, if you could talk through, I think you have touched on some of them, but maybe talk through the remaining product and service initiatives you have got underway for the fiscal year? And maybe share what goals you might have in terms of retention rates exiting this fiscal year, if you could give us any color to that? That will be great. Martin Mucci : I will start with the latter. Certainly, our goal is always to be at the best we have ever been. I think we are approaching that from a client retention level. First quarter doesn\u2019t make the year, but we certainly have seen continuous improvement in our net promoter scores and our satisfaction surveys, which have been translated into even better retention and we went through a pretty big service kind of realignment 2 years ago that really settled out through last year and we really feel like all of that is behind us now and has worked very effectively and how we are servicing clients in different ways with different teams. We have also added a lot of technology for the retention. So, we have put in a whole new unified communications system across all of our branches and locations. We collect a lot more data. I know lot more about the clients, what they are looking at, what their history has been before I ever talk to them when they are calling in. And of course, we have continued to use a lot of data analytic models to anticipate if a client is possibly going to leave us or not and then do proactive calling to them. So, our goal is certainly to have the best retention ever in our history and we hit that peak about 2 years ago, 2.5 years and we are slightly below that and aiming for more. From a product standpoint, Jim, we are very proud that HR Tech, just a few weeks ago we released as I mentioned the learning management, Paychex Learning Management that type training into development. So now we have kind of a fully bundled development. So we are helping, you can think about it all the way from acquiring new employees for our clients, we can do all of that paperless in a paperless fashion right from the recruiting to the on-boarding of the client so nothing, there is no paper necessary. Once they are in the system, now we\u2019ve been much more full-featured as far as training them, developing them, giving turnover data analytics of what\u2019s going on in the environment. I think the data and the enhancements have never come faster. And then adding more self-service, so where the other thing we\u2019re seeing is a lot of clients wanting self-service, so meaning that if they have questions or their employees have questions or their employees want to make changes that we allow them to do that in the app whether mobile or on the desktop. They can make changes, they can ask questions, we\u2019ll be introducing a chatbot that we showed at HR Tech that will basically service up 50 or 60 answers the questions, all you have to do is where is my W-2 or where do I find this or how do I do that and that will pop up and you will see that continue to evolve throughout the year. Jim Schneider : That\u2019s helpful. And maybe a corollary question to that is, are you seeing those initiatives now starting to translate to higher bookings at this point, and I know you don\u2019t give the precise bookings figures, but is there a way to quantify how much higher bookings were this quarter than say a year ago quarter? Martin Mucci : Now without giving it to you, but a good try anyway. But \u2013 we\u2019re \u2013 I would just say we had some momentum going into the last half of last year, we feel like that has continued. So, hey selling season is the peak and we\u2019re fully staffed up on our sales team. We did that very quickly. Well we added some additional sales. We have added more to virtual, to telephonic as well, both field and telephonic. And I think we\u2019re well positioned for a peak selling season, product wise and sales wise. And they have a lot \u2013 by the way I didn\u2019t even mention the sales team has a lot more tools as well. So when you think about the use of sales force and how sophisticated sales force has now become for them, it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s amazing the tools that are at their disposal and the ability to train and get them to use it is coming much better too because they\u2019re seeing that when they give us data on a prospect that maybe didn\u2019t close this time, they\u2019re getting a lot more information back the next time they got out and talk to CPAs, current clients et cetera. So, it\u2019s starting to translate. We didn\u2019t quite call it the year yet but because we got to get through that peak selling season, but we\u2019re feeling really good about where we are now. Jim Schneider : Well, I had this right. Thanks very much though. Martin Mucci : Okay, alright. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Tien-tsin. Tien- tsin Huang : Good morning. Thanks for the slides. It\u2019s all very helpful. Just a couple of quick clarification questions and I have a strategic question. Just within the PEO side, I heard you mention it\u2019s more new rather than existing, but I\u2019m curious, are you taking pre-existing PEO clients and converting to your own or these first time PEO clients? Just trying to understand the end-market dynamics? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I don\u2019t have a good split between previous \u2013 obviously the \u2013 that the \u2013 you get a lot outside the PEO who have \u2013 who know PEO. So, we\u2019re doing well there and the split as to new to PEO, I don\u2019t know, my suspicion is it\u2019s more people who know about the PEO model to start with. Tien- tsin Huang : Okay. Efrain Rivera : But I do want to say just reiterate Tien-tsin what you said which is as we looked at the data we always had a certain amount of PEO clients outside the base, but that trend has certainly been accelerating. Tien- tsin Huang : Got it. Now it seems that way. Within \u2013 then within core payroll I know the segmenting is changing, but just as we go into 2Q, 3Q, you mentioned it will be at the high-end or above the range. Is that just a function of the processing days or are there any other drivers pricing, units, retention that you might see? Efrain Rivera : Yes. It is a function of the days, but our assumption is that through the year we build in terms of sales units and sales volume as we progress through the next three quarters. And as Marty said we\u2019re off to a decent start this year. Tien- tsin Huang : Okay, got it. So, backlog conversion, okay, great. And then last one just for you Marty just if you don\u2019t mind, just a high-level question on freelancers and that whole market. I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s an area of focus for you to potentially go after that freelance market? Martin Mucci : Maybe I\u2019m not sure. Efrain Rivera : 1099 gig. Martin Mucci : Oh, I\u2019m sorry, like the gig economy. Tien- tsin Huang : The gig economy, sorry. Martin Mucci : That\u2019s alright. Tien- tsin Huang : It\u2019s a trendier word to use. Martin Mucci : It\u2019s I think we are well prepared for that. We have been building out a number of the products I am looking at it from a strategy standpoint of how do we look at from an insurance, retirement, savings and payroll, but even more so from the benefit side, how do you look at ways to let that follow the employee as opposed to being so client focused, the employer focused. And I think we will have some things to talk about in future quarters as we are rolling that out. We are not seeing a big impact from that right now. I think it was a little bit overstated last year, but we are certainly preparing for that. And I think already with the mobile app and the way we are building out the data by employee, you are going to see much more of a shift toward the employee and how they can carry information with them. And we will be prepared to react to that as it continues to grow. Tien- tsin Huang : Very good. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Great. Alright. Efrain Rivera : Thanks. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO. Please go ahead. Mr. Silber, maybe of your mute button on. We will move on to the next question. It comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks. Good morning, guys. How are you? Martin Mucci : Good morning, Jason. Jason Kupferberg : Good. So, I just had a question to follow-up on Core Payroll. Thanks for continuing to give the disclosure there. I just wanted to try and break down the pieces, because it seems like there is a few moving parts. So, I guess it seems like the tailwind from Lessor was more or less offset by the one less processing day. So if that\u2019s right, you have got about this 1% underlying revenue growth. And it does sound like pricing is still a tailwind. I know it had been running around 2%. So, I was just trying to figure out the implications for organic client count, because qualitatively it doesn\u2019t sound based on what you are saying that, that metric would be down year-over-year, but what are the other pieces here? Is this a average client size issue or is organic client comp down? Efrain Rivera : No, no, no. No, it isn\u2019t. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Efrain Rivera : And I don\u2019t typically give quarterly, but I can say no. No, it\u2019s really client size and that abates as we go through the year. We anticipate that it will abate in addition to all of the other factors changing as we go through the year. We have another day. We assume better unit and volume growth, all of those and mix abates a bit. So, it\u2019s those factors. Jason Kupferberg : Are you running at about 16 on the average client size now? Efrain Rivera : We are between I think 15 and 16 is where we ended up the client base last year. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, okay. Can you just talk a little bit about what the differences maybe in the pricing trends between renewals of existing clients versus pricing for new clients that you are bidding on? And just I guess at a high level, are you still running at around a 2% pricing uplift? Martin Mucci : Yes. You want to take that? Efrain Rivera : No, go ahead. Martin Mucci : I think yes, that would be \u2013 our anticipation is still 2 to 3, we have always said kind of 2 to 4, but tend to recognize a little on the lower end of that. I think on new clients what you are seeing is some discounting there upfront, but we are able to get to roll that off very effectively and pretty quickly through using a lot of data analytics. We started this a number of years ago, but instead of leaving it to kind of individual branches to decide how to roll off discounts, we do it on a much more automated basis and it\u2019s done with data analytics. So we know based on the history of the client whether we can roll off more of a discount or less of a discount and that has been very effective for us at bringing the price, the discount back off. So, you are still seeing pretty much the same level of competition upfront, which drives a little bit more of the discounting or the same level of discounting, but we are able to roll that off. And I think between the service levels, the additional products we offer, all of that allows you to bring \u2013 getting drive more revenue per client kind of after you have the client. And once you have the client, the price increase seems to stick pretty well. So, the more of that discounting is more upfront to get the client in a competitive environment, but not as much once you are going forward. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Thanks for the commentary, guys. Martin Mucci : Sure. Efrain Rivera : You are welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rick Eskelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Rick Eskelsen : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Martin Mucci : Sure. Rick Eskelsen : Just one for me. I am just wondering if you can talk about the Talent Acquisition, you did mention Marty in your script about how you are fully stepped up on the sales headcount increases you were looking for, but just in general across your organization how has it been finding talent and maybe if you could spend a little time on finding sales talent as you upped your investments? Thanks. Martin Mucci : Yes. Interesting question, I think it\u2019s still been pretty good as far as finding. I know there is shortages that are difficult to find based on the work that we do in the overall market as well as Paychex itself. It\u2019s more in the IT side and we have actually have been very successful there too. That\u2019s where when you get into certain disciplines of IT, security and so forth, that\u2019s been difficult. Sales has not been too difficult. I think one there \u2013 we are attracting good solid sales folks who are \u2013 who typically we still look for that some sales experience already and they are seeing the level of products and success that we are having. They are seeing growth opportunities that when they come into the company they could start and frankly in virtual telephonic they can grow to the field payroll, they can advance the mid-market, they can grow into HRS. In fact we just came back from our sales conference two weeks ago and just tremendous enthusiasm and a lot of good employee referrals. So we are really not having an issue of getting fully stepped. In fact we got fully stepped faster than we expected in the first quarter because of the success in the recruiting and the retention is improving across virtually every sales organization. So the retention is getting back in line where we were historically as well. I think that\u2019s all about them feeling like they have got the right tools, sales force, the enhancements we have made to that, the lead generation that they are getting, the leads and that they can be successful. All of that equates well to acquiring and retaining the talent. Rick Eskelsen : Thank you. Martin Mucci : Thanks. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO. Please go ahead. Jeff Silber : Can you hear me? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Good Jeff, we were worried about you. Jeff Silber : Thank you so much. This is going to be really quick. I know you are not directly impacted by all the noise regarding tariff wars etcetera. Are you seeing though any hesitation from your clients that might be impacted that could indirectly impact you? Martin Mucci : Not at this point. We are not seeing much. There are specific small and mid-size businesses that are impacted whether they are supplying the automobile industry and so forth, but we have not seen much of an impact on our client base at all. And when you think about also when we saw the storm impacting awful lot of businesses in South Carolina and North Carolina we didn\u2019t \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen too much of an impact there yet either. So, so far retention is in very good shape as I mentioned earlier and we are not seeing an impact either from regulation and tariff changes or the hurricane. Jeff Silber : Okay, great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Martin Mucci : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Samad Samana : Hi. Thanks for taking my question this morning. A couple of follow-ups to some of the answers, you mentioned a lot of new tools for the sales organization, I was wondering maybe dig deeper into what those are and how much you are factoring in productivity increases from these tools into the forecast for this year and then I have one follow-up? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think when you think about like sales force, we have had sales force for some time but we have really added a team that has really worked with the sales team to say what to encourage them to find it to be much more useful. And so we have gotten a lot more into the analytics of sales force and we have also profiled the clients and the leads that they are getting much better. So let me start with the leads, when the leads come in, in the past as I mentioned they were in kind of one big bucket. So all the leads that came in that had interest kind of went out to the sales force and they may have been of different quality. We started with a new leader in marketing and with a lot of experience in demand generation started making these much more sophisticated. We are scoring the leads now. At the front end we have a team that has been talking to leads for some time taking them through the web, etcetera and now scoring them and if they don\u2019t score high enough they were put kind of back into system to get \u2013 to really get worked and continue to provide information and details to prospective clients before we send a sales person out to them.  And so we are seeing that the quality of the leads to the sales team is much better. But as the sales team continues to use sales force and gives us more data on their prospects that goes back into data analytics that is then helps us profile the clients, also profile the CPAs and give you more data on the CPAs and what\u2019s the last time that they referred us, who referred us, how they referred us, what they referred us, all of giving the sales rep much more data to go out and approach either a prospective client or current client for referral, a CPA or other lead referral source. And you\u2019re also evolving into giving them a lot more data on their mobile phone as to where their next appointments are, how they make the best use of their time and how they can then get data off of social media on those prospects, so then when I walk into a prospect I know a lot about them already from our internal resources and combining that with external resources. So the level of sophistication and the tools that we give them has increased dramatically just even in the last six to 12 months. And we are starting to see some benefits from that one I think better retention of the sales force and certainly we\u2019re looking for an improved productivity as well and it\u2019s a little early in the year to talk about that, but so far as we have said number of times we think we\u2019re off to a good start. Samad Samana : That\u2019s very helpful. And then maybe if I could just ask a follow-up with that in mind and then some of the commentary about non-traditional competitors and customer acquisition, I am curious if you\u2019ve seen a change in your customer acquisition cost as you move more to virtual and/or your non-traditional competitors try to spend aggressively and building their merchant base? I am just curious what you\u2019ve seen in your customer acquisition cost trends? Martin Mucci : Yes. I would say first of all not in the merchant base, I mean I think again it seems like they\u2019ve got an awful lot of play and we just haven\u2019t seen that there and I think it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s not really much of an impact at least at this time. What we have seen is that the shift of dollars have definitely gone toward marketing. So, where you would necessarily shift \u2013 put dollars more into sales, we continue to put dollars into sales, but I have to say some of it has shifted earlier in the process. So redesigning our web, redesigning the whole lead-flow that I just talked about, data analytics and the work in building those support systems, more money goes into and investment goes into the marketing side. And overall that probably does raise the cost of acquiring a client to some degree certainly, but you\u2019re also getting more productive on the sales side or that\u2019s your hope. So, you are getting more revenue and more success and higher close rate as a result of that, but you\u2019re definitely doing more upfront in the spend as much more upfront to get that. This is the way they\u2019re searching. Most clients\u2019 prospects today are 60% of the way through the sales process before we even get contacted, that\u2019s very different than in our past and we think we\u2019re very much ready for that. Samad Samana : That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks again for taking my questions. Martin Mucci : Sure. Efrain Rivera : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Berkley with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. James Berkley : Thanks guys. Appreciate the time. On the service revenue disaggregation slide, I think you put out earlier this week, the last week rather, I was just wondering if you could speak to the drop off in growth for the restated HR Management Solutions revenue from fiscal \u201817 and \u201818 end, goes from what 6.1 to 2.9? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I just make that really quick. So, what happens there is that because we bundle into that revenue the impacts from modules related to Affordable Care Act, you didn\u2019t see that growth in that number, so that number started to tail off just \u2013 we penetrated the base and that part of the module which a couple of years earlier started at basically zero didn\u2019t grow very much, so that dropped off in growth. And then the second thing was the impact to payroll services revenue growing more slowly as seen in that number. You will see if you look at the numbers that we\u2019re projecting in terms of growth for the remainder of the year that we bounced back off that number that we had last year and we start to see better growth in the back half of this year, but those are the reasons, growth and payroll growth in that one category was muted. James Berkley : Okay, thanks. And just a quick follow-up, I know last quarter you guys talked about organic growth guidance being like 1.5% for payroll and then 9% to 10% for HRS. Are you able to provide those numbers for the new segmentation? Efrain Rivera : We repeated it. It should be on the website. So, we breakout management solutions and PEO and insurance and then we just reaffirmed the guidance that we provided for the full year, so\u2026 James Berkley : On an organic basis? Efrain Rivera : On an organic basis. Yes, I think what we said, James, was that Lessor would be about 1% of payroll growth. James Berkley : Okay. Alright, thank you very much. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Kartik Mehta : Hey, good morning, Efrain and Marty. Martin Mucci : Good morning. Kartik Mehta : I wanted to go back to I think, Efrain, you were talking about client growth. And I am just wondering if you can talk about maybe is there a difference in the client growth you are seeing between your traditional payroll and SurePayroll? And so in essence, are you seeing client growth in both and is one greater than the other? Martin Mucci : We don\u2019t breakout the client base between them anymore, Kartik. But I think both are growing. You certainly see, as Efrain said, on the low end of both companies you are seeing a stronger growth. We really feel like that has picked up a lot of momentum, particularly on the low end. And I think that\u2019s a lot of the things that we have been talking about, the demand generation, the virtual sales team, the faster response to leads, doing it with chat and selling over the phone much more. So, I think both of them are doing well. Certainly, Sure has continued to see good growth as well, really pleased with the team there. Kartik Mehta : And just lastly, on the PEO side, any thoughts on maybe price competition, it seems like that business is really growing well. So I am assuming it\u2019s attracting all of the competitors into that space. So, any worries on that becoming a little bit more price competitive as we go through this fiscal year? Martin Mucci : Always some concern with that. But I think right now, what you see in those kind of clients that are taking a PEO solution is they are much more interested in the service that they are getting and the support for the insurance in particular. And they are looking at those costs and do you have the right insurance plans and do you have the right service with the HR generalist and we have 500 of those out there that are supporting PEO and ASO. Do they have the right experience? It\u2019s really much more of a value play. So frankly I worry less about that price competition than I would small business payroll, which is much more competitive. And so the more that we grow toward the PEO side from a price standpoint, I think that the value is much stronger to say, hey, we hear plenty of clients that say to us this was having a strong HR person and this insurance plan was very valuable to my business and they probably pay more. Kartik Mehta : Thanks, Marty. I appreciate it. Martin Mucci : Okay, Kartik. Operator : And the last question that we have in queue comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Neill with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Martin Mucci : Hi, Matt. Matt O\u2019Neill: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. It\u2019s actually already been answered. So I thank you for the time. Martin Mucci : Yes. Okay, thank you. Operator : And we have no further question in queue at this time. Martin Mucci : Alright. Thank you. And at this point, we will close the call. If you\u2019re interested in replaying the webcast for this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 30 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our first quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. We very much appreciate it and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point. Now, I will turn the meeting over to your host, Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2018. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on the website for approximately 1 month. On today\u2019s call, I will review the business highlights for the second quarter and Efrain will review our second quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal 2019. And then we will open it up for your questions. Financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 reflect good progress against our objectives in growth across our major product lines. Our total revenue growth was 7% for the second quarter, management solutions revenue grew a solid 5%, and PEO and insurance services revenues grew a strong 15% compared to the prior year quarter. Sales momentum has been positive. We have added to our sales force and are fully staffed for our peak selling season and we have implemented a number of tools and strategies that are aiding in that momentum. With respect to client retention, we continue to be pleased with current trends and our strong client satisfaction performance. On November 26, 2018, we announced an agreement to acquire Oasis Outsourcing Group Holdings, L.P. for $1.2 billion. Oasis is the largest privately held PEO in the U.S. and an industry leader in providing HR outsourcing services. This acquisition is anticipated to close in this quarter. Oasis is a good fit with our PEO growth strategy adding to our scale, expanding relationships with new insurance partners, creating up-sell opportunities into the existing Oasis customer base and augmenting our leadership talent with the addition of an Oasis experienced leadership team. This acquisition will significantly advance our leadership position in HR outsourcing and when close Paychex and Oasis combined will serve more than 1.4 million worksite employees through our various HR outsourcing services. We expect to finance this acquisition with $800 million of new debt along with cash on hand. Our Paychex IHS Markit Small Business Employment Watch shows the light labor market continues to create a challenging hire environment for many of our clients. The workplace has been evolving partly due to this tight labor market and as a result of technology advances. In August, we were named one of the world\u2019s most innovative companies by Forbes, and in this vein, we continue to focus on enhancing our products and technology to increase efficiencies for our clients. Recent enhancements to features and functionality in Paychex Flex will simplify the complexity of finding and retaining talent, optimize HR and overall business performance and remove obstacles that stand in the way of our client\u2019s productivity. We have enhanced our HR dashboard, creating the functionality that will make it the destination for clients looking to manage and develop their workforce. This dashboard includes advanced analytics, seamless access to Paychex learning and a state-of-the-art performance management process. New workflows and approval functionality in Paychex Flex ensure proper checks and balances occur with employee self-service activities, which have also increased. The use of self service will drive greater efficiency for our clients. During this summer, we introduced live reports with turnover and headcount data allowing clients to view consolidated data to quickly identify trends and gain meaningful insights into their business and we are now adding the ability for clients to compare turnover rates \u2013 employee turnover rates with similar companies through our benchmarking live report. These significant technology product enhancements in the last quarter support our clients in recruiting, on-boarding, training and developing their employees in a market, where it is increasingly difficult to find and retain employees, particularly for the small and midsized companies. In addition to our technology, our team of over 500 HR specialists around the country serve our clients growing HR needs as states have increasingly made it more difficult and challenging to run and grow their businesses without this expertise. We also continue to evolve our Paychex Flex APIs to give clients the ability to add new worker using our API. This allows us to continue to develop new partnership opportunities with third-parties that our clients engage. I would like to congratulate our Paychex Insurance Agency, which has been named in the Business Insurance Magazine\u2019s list of best places to work in insurance for the fourth consecutive year. This ranking improved one spot to number 12 this year, I am very proud of the Paychex culture that fosters engagement and growth among our employees. I will conclude by saying that our state-of-the-art technology, our full suite of integrated HCM product offerings and personalized service is a powerful combination that positions us for sustainable growth in our markets. Our employees make this combination successful with their hard work and commitment to our clients each and everyday. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the second quarter. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Marty. Good morning. I would like to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call contains forward-looking statements that refer to future events and such involve risks. Please refer to our earnings release that includes a discussion of these statements and related risk factors. In addition, I will periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures such as adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These measures exclude certain discrete tax items and one-time charges. Please refer to our press release and investor slide presentation for a discussion of these measures and a reconciliation in the second quarter to their related GAAP measures. I will start by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter and then follow up with some greater detail in certain areas. I will touch briefly on results and wrap with a review of our fiscal 2019 outlook. Total revenue and total service revenue both grew 7% for this second quarter to $859 million and $841 million respectively. The acquisition of Lessor Group accounted for less than 1% of the growth in service revenue. Expenses were up 10% for the second quarter to $552 million, Lessor accounted for approximately 2% of this growth. The remaining growth related to accelerated investment in sales and marketing, product development as part of our tax reform investments, together with growth in PEO direct and insurance costs. In addition, we incurred some one-time expenses relating to the Oasis acquisition. Operating income increased 1% to $307 million. Operating margin was about 36% for the second quarter. Margins were impacted by accelerated spending and growth in the PEO. Our effective income tax was 23.8% for the second quarter compared to 34.8% for the respective prior year quarter. The significant decline year-over-year on the effective tax is due to tax reform legislation. We anticipate that effective tax rate will be approximately 24% for the remainder of the year. Net income increased 19% to $236 million for the second quarter and adjusted net income increased 20%. Diluted earnings per share increased 18% to $0.65 for the second quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20%. I will now provide some additional color in selected areas. Management solutions revenue, which includes our payroll service revenue, together with our HCM products included in many of our product bundles increased 5% to $685 million for the second quarter. This increase was driven by growth in client bases across our HCM services, including payroll, ASO, retirement services and time and attendance solution. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in the asset value of participant funds. PEO and insurance services revenue increased 15% to $155 million for the second quarter. In August, we anniversaried the acquisition of HROI, growth was primarily driven by continued strong demand for combined PEO services, which along with WSE growth in our existing client base resulted in double-digit growth in client worksite employees served. Our insurance services revenue benefited from growth in the number of health and benefits applicants. Interest on funds held for clients, it increased 31% for the second quarter to $18 million, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates earned. Investments and income, our goal as you know is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. On the short-term side, primary short-term investment vehicles were bank demand deposit accounts and variable rate demand notes. In our longer term portfolio, we invest primarily in high credit quality municipal bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. government agency securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 2% and average duration of 3.1 years. Combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.9% for the second quarter, up from 1.5% last year. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients were relatively flat for the second quarter primarily driven by the impacts of wage inflation offset by lower client employee withholdings resulting from tax reform. Year-to-date let me briefly summarize the 6-month period. Management solutions revenue increased 4% approximately 1% was contributed by Lessor. PEO and insurance services revenue increased 26%, 17% on an organic basis. Interest on funds held for clients increased 28% driven by interest rate increases. Total revenue up 8%, operating margins were 36.4%, tempered somewhat by accelerated investments in the business and growth in PEO direct and insurance costs, net income increased 70% and adjusted net income increased 19%, diluted earnings per share increased 18%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 19%. I will now walk you through highlights on our financial position. It remains strong with cash and total corporate investments of $769 million as of November 30, 2018. Funds held for clients as of November 30 were $3.7 billion compared to $4.7 billion as of May 31, 2018. Funds held for clients as you know vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.7 billion for the second quarter and 6 months. Our total available-for-sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized losses of $45 million as of November 30, 2018 compared with $38 million as of May 31, 2018. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $2.4 billion as of November 30, 2018 reflecting $403 million in dividends paid and $33 million worth of shares repurchased during the first half of fiscal 2019. Our return on equity for the past 12 months is a very respectable 45%. Cash flows from operations were $497 million for the 6 months, a decrease of 4% from the same period last year. The decrease was driven by working capital fluctuations related to timing around collections and related tax payments for our combined PEO business and a decrease in accrued liability balances in connection with the termination of certain licensing agreements. Other impacts on non-cash adjustments were offset within working capital fluctuations. Fiscal 2019 guidance. I remind you that our outlook is based on current view of economic conditions continuing at no significant changes that will give guidance excluding any anticipated impacts from the Oasis acquisition and then follow with the anticipated impact of Oasis on our results. We have tightened some of the guidance we have previously provided. The revised guidance is as follows. Interest on funds held for clients is anticipated to grow 20% to 25%. We assume no interest rate rises after this anticipated December raise. We will see if that occurs today. Investment income net is anticipated to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million. Net income and diluted earnings per share anticipated to grow approximately 4% and adjusted diluted earnings per share anticipated to increase now in the range of 11% to 12%. Other aspects of our guidance remain unchanged from what we have previously provided. The guidance is reiterated as following. Management solutions revenue is anticipated to grow by approximately 4% for fiscal 2019. PEO and insurance services revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of 18% to 20%. Total revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of 6% to 7%. Operating income as a percent of total revenues is anticipated to be approximately 37%. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2019 is expected to be approximately 24%. And adjusted net income for non-GAAP expected to increase again in the range of 11% to 12%. I will now provide you with a little additional color on the second half of the year. We anticipate that management solutions revenue growth in the second half of fiscal 2019 will be approximately 4% with Q3 at or above this rate and Q4 below this rate due primarily to the anniversary of the Lessor acquisition. For PEO and insurance services, revenue growth in the first half was significantly higher due the timing of the HROI acquisition. We anticipate growth for Q3 to be in the range of 15% to 17% and for Q4 to be in the range of 10% to 13% due to the challenging compared with strong PEO growth in the later part of fiscal 2018. Assuming the completion of Oasis, the Oasis acquisition which we expect to occur in the future, we anticipate that Oasis will have an incremental impact on revenue in the range of $155 million to $175 million for the balance of the year. We expect that approximately 45% of this incremental revenue will occur in Q3 and the remainder will occur in Q4. Excluding one-time costs related to the acquisition, we anticipate that Oasis will have minimal impact on our diluted earnings per share for the year. With one-time acquisition costs, we anticipate that the acquisition will be approximately $0.03 dilutive for fiscal 2019 primarily due as I said to the acquisition costs. And now with those comments, I will now hand it back to Marty. Martin Mucci : Great. Thanks Efrain. Operator, we will now open the call to questions please. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Hi, Kevin. Kevin McVeigh : Hey, how are you? Martin Mucci : Good. Kevin McVeigh : Just real quick. Really good results. Obviously, there has been a lot of unevenness in the market. Any change at the margin in terms of the client discussions, I mean it seems like the payroll really scaled up nice, so really nothing in the fundamentals. But anything you would call out just given obviously some of the noise that\u2019s been occurring since you last reported? Martin Mucci : No. I think what we are finding is that we are getting \u2013 we are seeing momentum on the sales side and we are seeing retention numbers that are very positive and heading back toward our all time best on the client retention. So we are feeling good about the momentum in the first half of the year. Of course, we are heading into selling season, we are in selling season, which is really an important time for us and we are feeling good at this point. We are seeing business kind of environment pretty good and certainly in need of HR outsourcing in particular, because of all the things that are going on with state regulations in particular. And I think that\u2019s really helping what you are seeing is kind of that double-digit growth on worksite employees, particularly in the PEO business. So we are seeing a good need for the HR services and all of our products. Kevin McVeigh : And just Marty, following up on that client retention at an all-time high, what\u2019s been driving that? And are you seeing any kind of trends in the smaller businesses as opposed to larger, just really nice job there and should we expect that to continue? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think as I said we are heading kind of \u2013 we are getting closer to that all time high in retention we had. I think that we are still seeing the same kind of number of businesses going out of business. I think we are seeing an improvement in those that left for service or price. I would say the competitive environment is about the same. There is always some pressure there, but we seem to be doing very well from a retention standpoint and from a selling standpoint. We have got some momentum there. So I don\u2019t think we are seeing a lot different in competition and I think we are really holding our own and showing some momentum on the sales side. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Berkley from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. James Berkley : Good morning and thanks guys and congrats. How are you doing? Martin Mucci : Good. James Berkley : Just a quick question on Oasis, could you just talk about what you expect the accretion to look like there on a cash basis just given that you tend to accelerate D&A for tax purposes. I would think it looks even more attractive on the cash side, but just wanted to hear your thoughts? Martin Mucci : Yes. James, I\u2019ll hold that a little bit. We do expect it on a cash basis for it to be accretive. Their margins are at or above our margins on PEO. So that will be a positive going forward. We will talk more once we have closed the acquisition in Q3, but we think it\u2019s going to be a nice add from a cash basis. James Berkley : Okay, thanks. And then obviously that was the largest private PEO provider in the U.S. and if you could just comment on what other M&A opportunities you see and your thoughts on timing, your comfort level with leverage and just how you think about your broader PEO strategy going forward? That would be really helpful. Martin Mucci : Sure. I think from an acquisition, we are always looking at a number of opportunities. I think certainly there is a number of other PEO opportunities there and we are looking \u2013 and Oasis was pretty active. As a private company, they were pretty active on the acquisition side, particularly on the smaller ones and being able to integrate those in. So we think that gaining scale in the PEO business is very good. Obviously that was part of this move is it gains us more scale with the insurance carriers. It picks up new markets. And we have been able to do some thing \u2013 we will be able to do some things, I think with Oasis clients that if they don\u2019t fit in the underwriting, we can get them to our insurance agency which is the 20th largest insurance agency in the country right now. So we feel there is a lot of opportunity on the PEO side. In other areas, there are some acquisitions as well. I think we have been closed on a few, not too worried about, I mean we are always watching for the leverage, but from a debt perspective, but this was \u2013 I think we will be very successful in getting a good debt placement here. And I think that given our balance sheet and cash flows that we will have other opportunity to do more if we need to do it. We are always watching for that shareholder return and be sure that we are using cash obviously in the best way for our shareholders. And I think we have got a long track record of that, but acquisitions are certainly always on the table and we are looking at a number of things. James Berkley : Thanks a lot. Appreciate the time. Martin Mucci : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Jason Kupferberg : Hey, thanks, guys. Good morning. Happy holidays. How are you? Martin Mucci : Thanks. Jason Kupferberg : Good, good. So I just wanted to circle back, if we think about last quarter, you guys had given some kind of quarterly layout on payroll, what you were thinking about the respective growth rates? And I think for Q2 and 3Q, the expectation was to be at, at least 3%, if I am not mistaken, because that\u2019s the high end of the full year 2% to 3% guide. And I think you came in at 2.8% in Q2. Are you still thinking Q3 will be at least 3% or any changes around the edges in the thought process there? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Jason, I don\u2019t see any reason why that wouldn\u2019t be the case. So, we feel pretty comfortable about where things are. And just to add a little bit of color about why we feel comfortable, Marty mentioned, I think sales process has \u2013 we have seen some momentum there. Retention has been good and then pricing has been stable. So I think all of those three say we should be certainly in that range. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. And just want to go little deeper on some of the macro dynamics, but I know you guys do fairly regular surveying of the small business base. So, just in terms of confidence and sentiment and sort of forward-looking indicators like it sounds like everything was fine in this latest quarter, but as you head into the new calendar year, are you detecting any changes at all just in terms of hiring intentions or prospects for new business creation? Martin Mucci : Jason, I think the interesting thing is the one thing we keep hearing is it\u2019s just tough to get employees. And so for small to midsized businesses, it\u2019s tough for them to recruit and retain employees. And one of the positives for us, because of that is they are looking for more benefits. They are looking to offer insurance. They are looking to be able to have better benefit enrollment kind of opportunities, better technology, self-service type of technology for their employees. And so generally, I think you still look at like the NFIB optimism, the business indexes are all near \u2013 still near historic highs and consumer optimism is high \u2013 consumer confidence. And so everything is high, but there is this concern about can I get the employees and we have heard where some small to midsized businesses have \u2013 and some of our surveys have actually said, hey, I have turned down some business, because I just can\u2019t get enough employees to do it. But there is still \u2013 the good news is there is optimism that there is work to do. It\u2019s just with a low unemployment rate, can I attract enough employees to get the work done. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. And just last from me, in terms of reinvestments, I just wanted to catch up on that topic at least for [ESR] [ph] model your margins came in better than expected. I know you are not changing the full year forecast. So quarterly cadence of reinvestments, just commentary there for the back half and then just your latest thinking on whether or not you think these reinvestments could cause a little bit of uptick in underlying revenue growth as we start to think ahead to next fiscal year directionally? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I would say this, so we did have a little bit lighter spending than we had guided in the quarter. It won\u2019t affect the back half of the year. Our perspective is if it wasn\u2019t spent, it wasn\u2019t spent. But I think the other part of the margin story was that revenue came in a little bit better than our plans had anticipated and so that dropped down to the bottom line. So we see strength, we will see what happens in the back half of the year, but it was a combination of both. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is now open. Ramsey El-Assal: Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the Fed in the path of rate hikes. I know you only have a single additional raise contemplated in your guidance, but would a slower pace of increase by the Fed cause you to change any internal plans about business investment or timing of investments or headcount additions or is there any other business impact or is your internal plans very much aligned with your sort of external guidance? Efrain Rivera : It\u2019s pretty much aligned with the external guidance, Ramsey. It really wouldn\u2019t change. I think when we came into the year, our thought process was we look at the same data you all look at. And we looked at the probability of raises, they were talking about 3 and 4 in calendar \u201819, we weren\u2019t buying it at the moment. And I think now that\u2019s become a little bit more uncertain, but it doesn\u2019t \u2013 it further raises are more uncertain. But it doesn\u2019t affect what we do. And I would say it\u2019s interesting that the macro backdrop has been uncertain and volatile. A lot \u2013 if you look at the vectors in our business, they are pointing up, not down, they are not pointing neutral, they are pointing up. And so when we look at the wealth of data that we have everything from business bankruptcies to the clients who go out of business to sales to new clients, it looks positive to us. So, now we are in a situation where things can change rapidly, but nothing that we are seeing says there are clouds on the horizon certainly in the back half of our fiscal year. Ramsey El-Assal: Yes, that\u2019s great to hear. And it doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t tuck ourselves into a recession. It would do the same. On another topic, I wanted to ask you about sort of the sales process and strategy in PEO. I mean you just rolled up Oasis. There is a handful of larger players out there like yourselves, there is a bunch of smaller folks out there as well. From the standpoint of a prospective customer, how do you close that sale, is there a big price discovery process? Is it expectation of service levels? What is it that gets them to go into your camp rather than to one of your competitors? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think it\u2019s always \u2013 it\u2019s not as much price I think it\u2019s going to be really the value of the technology and the service. And what we have been in this \u2013 Paychex has been in this for 20 years the outsource \u2013 HR outsourcing through both PEO and ASO and we have 500 HR specialists around the country that are dedicated to helping small and midsized business clients with their needs. So, you have good technology that they can use to enroll benefits and help their employees enroll in benefit, good insurance options for them particularly on the PEO side, the larger you get the more options you\u2019re going to have from carriers and those are really important benefits right now as I said earlier on, because of the competitiveness of attracting and retaining employees and then it\u2019s going to be that service piece, so from a client\u2019s perspective, it is getting more challenging every day whether it\u2019s marijuana use and whether it\u2019s legal or not, whether to do drug testing, how to handle drug testing, immigration, minimum wage, paid family leave, you need an HR support as a small to mid-sized business New York just came out with the need for a non-harassment training, that has to be done by the pretty much of the middle of next year for a company of any size basically I mean, these are a lot of needs and that\u2019s how you sell the HR outsourcing ASO or PEO. And PEO is becoming much more comfortable and things that well, it\u2019s not just limited to Florida and Texas it\u2019s a real need, and in this competitive environment for employees, that\u2019s how you sell that is your service and your technology. Ramsey El-Assal: A related and a final question for me, a brief one you basically also called out this Flex API and increased kind of capability to plug into potential partners QuickBooks integration, you talked about Facebook integration with social component in the last call are you going to lean deeper into sort of a partnership strategy to enhance the client bundle of a value proposition? Or is this just is this a trend? Or is this more just sort of a string of kind of one-offs? Martin Mucci : Yes, it\u2019s a great question I think we\u2019ve always had kind of the value of Paychex has been, I can offer you that full suite of products on our Flex system, everything fully integrated, real-time, mobile first design, single employee record kind of thing and we still offer that, however, you do find particularly in the mid market is more clients who say, hey look, I\u2019m used to having this record keeper for my retirement services or I\u2019m used to this time and attendance solution and I\u2019m just not ready to get off of all of that yet and switch to you so what we have found over time is particularly in that mid-market, we\u2019re opening up more and more APIs to say, hey look, you can stay with who you have if you wanted and of course, partnerships are always powerful from if you pick the right ones, to grow your base and do what you do best and things like QuickBooks were good fit particularly for the small and some of the lower end of the mid-sized for us so it\u2019s just a way of broadening out, whatever clients want, they can get from us, however, the real value I think we bring still is that on Flex, you can have the full suite of products, you can have retirement, nobody else provides the suite of products that we provide with a single employee record in the technology and service. Ramsey El-Assal: Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Keene from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Brian Keene : Hi guys. Good morning. I want to ask about Oasis, just what\u2019s the organic revenue growth profile of the company? And then what do you expect going forward? Is there any synergies between the two companies that could push it higher? Efrain Rivera : Yes, Brian, it\u2019s a upper single digit grower they also did some inorganic, we think that\u2019ll be part of the mix, which can drive that organic growth higher there are certainly synergies between the Oasis business and our existing PEO business as we add two of them, that will be working on aggressively the thing that we\u2019re in the process of looking at also is, look there\u2019s as you\u2019ve seen our results over the last certainly, three to four quarters, PEO is growing pretty rapidly and what we want to do is fuel growth not necessarily cut costs out of the business it\u2019s not one of those acquisitions, and one of the issues that we\u2019re looking very closely at is, do we add more sales people to get even greater coverage than we currently have so we\u2019re looking we\u2019re trying to balance the cost savings with additional investments to fuel even faster growth for Oasis. Martin Mucci : Yes, I think, Brian that when you this is a kind of perfect timing from a market standpoint the need for HR and the acceptance of PEO in particular, now you\u2019ve got two teams as I said we\u2019ve been doing this for 20 years, we\u2019ve got a very experienced team they\u2019ve got a very experienced team they\u2019ve been doing acquisitions of smaller PEOs they\u2019ve got insurance carrier relationships that we haven\u2019t had they\u2019ve got other markets where they\u2019ve got more scale that we haven\u2019t had it\u2019s a good combination at a good time in the market to really grow and obviously through the double digit worksite employee growth, we\u2019ve already been doing pretty consistently we expect this has really got a lot of more, as Efrain said, more revenues and top line synergies this isn\u2019t so much about cost cutting as it is about growing the business been a perfect time in the market. Brian Keene : Okay that\u2019s helpful. And then just curious to get an update, Marty, I know you talked about increasing the sales force, just trying to see if you can quantify that going into the selling season here? Martin Mucci : I think we\u2019ve been fully staffed, pretty much for this year so we\u2019re up, I think 3% to 4% maybe closer to 5%, if you put all sales teams in there and we\u2019re feeling very good about that we have been able to fill those spots particularly in mid-market and in the PEO and ASO services, and they\u2019ve got some nice momentum as we go into this as we\u2019re in this peak selling season. Brian Keene : Okay great. I will leave it there. Happy holidays guys. Martin Mucci : Thanks same to you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. Lisa Ellis : Hi thanks. Good morning guys. So a question on Oasis and HROI I mean, as you guys know we\u2019d love these businesses but I know historically concerned factor you guys have raised about doing acquisitions in the space has been around getting comfortable with the insurance risk in the underlying book so can you just talk about how with a company like Oasis you manage that and get comfortable with that? And I guess building on the experience with HROI? Martin Mucci : Yes, sure. I think obviously the due diligence, we\u2019re very careful on that and how we look at the company, they have not taken risk, and we felt based on some not only our own but some third-party analysis, that they were in very good shape from a book of business and so we are careful about who we pick, but we\u2019re very pleased with how Oasis look to us in the way they\u2019ve been doing business and what their book of business look like. Efrain Rivera : Yes, and the other thing, Lisa, that I want to add to that is, they while they do attach healthcare like all PEOs do, all of their business is based on guaranteed contracts so compared to other acquisitions that we have looked at, they\u2019re not taking risk on the healthcare side so that made it attractive to us especially given how they had built the business and how they were growing. Lisa Ellis : Got it. Okay, thank you. And then a question just to follow up related to the macroeconomic environment can you just describe on how if and when we ever do see a slowdown in the U.S., that impacts Paychex\u2019s business and sort of a second order basis meaning, of course, and slowdown in employment is not good, but I mean do you does that end up driving additional demand for things like PEO and ASO when you\u2019re in a downturn I\u2019m just curious kind of what the second order impacts are in your business? Martin Mucci : Yes, obviously as you said, the first order is fewer businesses more going out of business that kind of thing but in second order, you\u2019re right I think particularly in the environment we\u2019re in now versus even 10 years ago, there\u2019s a much bigger need now when there\u2019s a downturn, how do I attract and retain employees? Do I have the right technology, so can my employees use mobile apps? Can I be so when can I be more productive and use my employees to be more productive to help me be more productive? They\u2019re going to look for ways to cut costs, and using our technology and a lot of the self-service is going to help them to be more productive on the other side, they\u2019re going to have to attract and retain more employees or if they may have to lay off or do something like that, they\u2019re going to want to know how to do those things and do them right so that they don\u2019t face legal consequences I think more than 10 years ago and that\u2019s going to be an HR need for PEO, for ASO, time and attendance, you name it, I think those things will improve so second order, while there\u2019s certainly a first order hit of businesses out of business, loss of jobs and so forth, that second order is okay, it\u2019s more complex now, I need more help in other services. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thank you. Thanks guys. Happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tien- tsin Huang : Hi good morning. Happy holidays upfront here. You guys went through a lot already I just curious just maybe bigger picture question on Oasis why now do a deal of this size? I know this has been around for sometime, just curious why you felt like now was the right time to do such a large deal? Martin Mucci : Well, I think I do think that timing is by view we\u2019ve certainly known them for a long time and been an had an eye on the PEO, we felt that our own PEO was particular with HROI now with our PEO, we\u2019re really at a very mature level of leadership and sales performance and underwriting so we felt really good about where we were now than Oasis where it is right now, and the need in the market again as I\u2019ve said a couple of times that HROI need is really picked up and PEO is not just a Florida, Texas kind of thing, it is really taking off now with the need for HR support and the acceptance of PEO of the PEO business has really taken off so I think we gained more experience, we felt more comfortable with how strong our existing team was, the integration of HROI and how well that\u2019s gone and now it was time to take on the largest private PEO and make ourselves the second largest PEO, and frankly, the second largest HR outsourcer by worksite employees. Tien- tsin Huang : Got it. That makes sense. I am just curious then with Paychex now going after growth here, especially on the PEO side, and then also investing as you\u2019ve talked about in the past will we be able to break out or appreciate or evaluate the impact of margins from Oasis as well as the impact of margins from your investments, and then the subsequent benefits you might be getting from those investments? Just trying to understand, how if there\u2019s a way that we\u2019ll be able to evaluate the return on investments that you\u2019re making away from Oasis? Does that makes sense? Efrain, I know we\u2019ve talked about this. Efrain Rivera : Yes, so short answer Tien-tsin is yes, we\u2019ll give more information as we go through the year through the year so that people can make those judgments on what\u2019s going on so and you\u2019re right there are there are value enhancing investments that we\u2019re doing in the management solutions side, that over time we would expect improved margins there and there\u2019s acquisitions that we are doing on the PEO and insurance side that will help to fuel revenue growth and over time also improve margins there so we\u2019ll give more color as we go through. Tien- tsin Huang : Great. Thank you both. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Operator : Thank you, our next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair. Your line is now open. Tim McHugh : Thanks. Just a follow-up on that, I know you said Oasis margins are similar to your PEO margins I guess can you give us color on what that would be I guess as we roll this in? Efrain Rivera : Tim, I\u2019ll leave for now the discussions of specific margins I think we called out where we\u2019re going to be for the balance of the year, but from a PEO perspective, I just leave it right now, that Oasis is pretty comparable to where we are from a margin standpoint on PEO and actually in some cases a little bit better, because they don\u2019t take any risk on health insurance we\u2019ll update more once we close the deal and then can provide more definitive information going forward. Tim McHugh : Okay given the way they structure their contract, is there as much passthrough revenue? Efrain Rivera : No so I mean that\u2019s a good point, and that\u2019s one reason why we\u2019ll talk more once the deal is closed so because and as you know, Tim, because you know the space pretty well everyone accounts for PEO revenue differently, in our case, if it\u2019s a guaranteed contract, we don\u2019t run that through revenue, we were running through revenue the healthcare costs that we\u2019re taking risk on because Oasis doesn\u2019t do any healthcare, any take any risk on healthcare, that revenue does not run through their revenues they obviously have work comp revenue that they take risk on that runs through their revenues, but so there\u2019s differences in terms of a little bit of difference between their revenues and ours because of that, where we have guaranteed contracts we don\u2019t run it through the P&L either so margins actually that\u2019s why I say margins on an apples-to-apples basis are at or above our PEO margins. Tim McHugh : Okay. And then going back to I think the comment earlier was the sales force can depend how you want to count and up 3% to 5% do you mind how does that compare to last year and the year before, I guess, how much more resources are you going into the selling season with versus what we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years? Martin Mucci : Yes, Tim, we typically be up around 2% to 3% and I think this is 3% to 5% is more like you\u2019re adding the other work other sales forces in as well, so pretty much have grown across the board as we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ve moved some into what we call virtual for the \u2013 on the payroll, particularly, the small in payroll side we have moved inside in tele-sales, but we\u2019ve also added a number of sales people on the PEO, ASO side, the mid-market side is pretty strong as well, and because we took a little bit of a dip last year, but we\u2019re feeling good about the fact that we\u2019ve got good momentum in the first half of the year, and we\u2019re fully staffed as we\u2019re in this peak selling season. Tim McHugh : Okay great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman from Stifel Financial. Your line is now open. David Grossman : Thank you. Good morning. There is obviously a lot of discussion about the PEO and you\u2019ve changed your revenue segmentation, and I guess what I\u2019m curious about is if you could give us some insight into the changing business mix in new sales how much of these new sales are standalone payroll versus the bundle products compared to where we were maybe two or three years ago? Martin Mucci : Yes, I would say it\u2019s different bundles I would say it\u2019s more of a bundled product these days and kind of taking that full, looking for a full product on a very low end, you\u2019re still seeing, hey, I\u2019m looking for basic payroll to help me get started in the business and that one to four or even one to two employees size but above that five employees size, you\u2019re definitely seeing a larger interest and need for time and attendance solutions, HR support etcetera. we don\u2019t necessary breakout percentages, but it\u2019s definitely trended up, and that\u2019s one of the reasons to expand on the HR and the PEO side is that where 5 years ago, David, you\u2019d see, you needed 25 or 30 employees to really say hey I\u2019m interested in PEO or in HR outsourcing, now that is honestly 10 to 15 employees, sometimes need that support, because of the legal issues today, the requirements of the States, the minimum wage changes if you\u2019re multi-state employer, it is really tough even if you\u2019re small, and these rules don\u2019t apply to hey, you have to be 25 and above it\u2019s typically like this harassment \u2013 non-harassment training that\u2019s needed in New York, it\u2019s like one employee and above, you have to do this training by the middle of next year so they\u2019re seeing a lot more need so you\u2019re getting much more of the approach, the go-to-market approach and sales is much more about the full package, and the HR, you\u2019re leading much more with HR or a time and attendance solution etcetera. and the payroll is kind of yes it includes payroll, but the need is for much more of a fully comprehensive solution. Efrain Rivera : And it\u2019s just shifted to bundles. David Grossman : Right. I was just kind of thinking pricing aside, unit sale, how is that trended over the past couple of years in terms of what kind of revenue you\u2019re getting per unit sale versus what you\u2019re getting a couple of years ago? Efrain Rivera : I think you\u2019re talking about revenue per client, or. David Grossman : Right revenue per client on the unit sale. Efrain Rivera : Yes, revenue per client has been growing you look over I afraid I\u2019ve said, last three years, you\u2019re up in the 5% 6% range. David Grossman : Okay. And then just a follow up, I think Marty, actually both of you had mentioned this that the scale of Oasis relative to Paychex in certain geographies may help you can you give us sense of what percentage of your payroll installed base is in those geographies? Martin Mucci : Yes, I would say that\u2019s an interesting question I don\u2019t have the number of the top of my head. I can tell you that our PEO is certainly covered, probably where the majority of our payroll population is but we definitely have scale of payroll clients and other products in those areas, where they are and we don\u2019t have PEO so we think about it more as, there is in these markets that we\u2019re expanding and probably 10 different new markets, where they have some scale and we have not built it up, it\u2019s because we haven\u2019t built up the PEO in those in those areas and we haven\u2019t had the relationship with the carrier, the insurance carrier, who are the strongest in those markets and now we\u2019ll have scale with that carrier in those markets, and we certainly have enough clients existing to be able to sell PEO into and remember, we sell PEO directly as well so we sell to brand new clients, and as we just talked about that\u2019s a growing need, is they\u2019re interested in PEO right up front they are interested in HR outsourcing right up front, they\u2019re not it\u2019s not just the payroll base that we\u2019re selling to so while we have clients there I\u2019d say the majority of our client base payroll client base, we have covered with PEO, but these new markets, we certainly have thousands of clients that we can sell into, but again, we sell the PEO directly to brand new prospects. Efrain Rivera : And our PEO, David, as we\u2019ve talked before, it\u2019s predominately a California and Texas and Florida gain, and this gives us strength outside of that so I don\u2019t have a exact percentage for what California, Texas and Florida represent there, but this gives us access to a lot of markets that or at least strength a lot of markets we really weren\u2019t strong in before. David Grossman : Right and then just one last question, I would say there\u2019s been a lot of kind of headlines about the ACA the last week so the ACA was obviously a big catalyst for this industry a couple years ago, and obviously, we\u2019ve kind of anniversary and we\u2019ve kind of seen the reverse impact of that so any thoughts on directionally what the possibilities maybe for the PEO based on the outcome, what\u2019s going on right now? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think I see, it\u2019s been very interesting, I think even there\u2019s so much confusion in the marketplace among everybody, of course, as to whether it\u2019s in or out we have actually there\u2019s still been plenty of notices that have gone out to clients and non-clients of ours that have said, hey, you have a penalty, and you have to respond to this and so even though, it feels like it\u2019s people aren\u2019t sure whether it\u2019s on or off, clients are still getting penalties from previous years, saying that, they owe significant sums of money we have been very successful in helping not only our clients, we\u2019ve also offered a service, where if you weren\u2019t a client of ours, but you have a penalty notice and you want to come and talk to us, we\u2019ve been able to help a number of clients and have abated a significant millions and millions of dollars of potential penalties for them so it still is a very much a talking point to new clients and a retention point to existing clients that they need to report, they need to keep the information to report, and that they may get letters from the government saying, you owe something and you\u2019re going to need support on how to get out of it. Efrain Rivera : But the other part I build on from what Marty said, the tailwind we see for PEO, really has something to do with I think it got turbocharged by Affordable Care Act but really much more \u2013 it\u2019s much more now that integrated HR and benefit play and we saw strength, we saw strength starting two years or so ago, and that strength has continued and some of it has to do with ACA related issues, but a lot of it is really more HR than technology related. Martin Mucci : And the point I made you made earlier that in the on in such a low unemployment rate, these small and mid-sized companies are really looking to someone to help them have better insurance benefits, offer insurance benefits, help them enroll their employees in these benefits, because they\u2019re having to compete with really large companies and what their benefit plans are. David Grossman : Thanks for that and happy holidays. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Samad Samana : Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I was wondering on Oasis, so are all of their customers\u2019 PEO, the 270,000 WSEs, and I know that Paychex historically has included both ASO and PEO clients in their WSE cap could you give us maybe an apples-to-apples number of what the PEO WSE cap looks like following the Oasis acquisition? Efrain Rivera : Well, we don\u2019t breakout separately we\u2019ll do that as we close the acquisition when we give you the $1.4 million WSEs, there is a significant amount of those that obviously are ASO employees when they when you\u2019re using the 270 figure, they have some ASO employees included in that, they are between 200 and 300 closer to the midpoint on PEO clients, so some of their clients on the numbers that are floating around really are ASO, so we would count them as ASO clients. Samad Samana : Great thanks for that clarification and that\u2019s why I asked. And then I know that Oasis, I think they were using a third-party software vendor called Prism HR I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re factoring in the opportunity to migrate those customers over to Paychex Flex or if that\u2019s something that\u2019s further down the road and maybe help us understand if there\u2019s a revenue or margin opportunity and the magnitude of that? Martin Mucci : I think yes, certainly will be looking at that and looking at how what Prism, the flexibility in the offering of Prism, which we think has been very solid for their clients and certainly Flex is for ours so we\u2019ll be looking at the two platforms and it will be further down the road, that is not a necessarily a big savings or anything a synergy that we\u2019re counting on there, because this is more of what provides the best client service and technology for their clients for our clients, and we\u2019ll be looking at that, but that\u2019s not a big part of the synergy is to try to save and that we want to make sure it\u2019s a great experience for the clients no matter what platform they are on. Samad Samana : Great. And maybe just one last one retention was mentioned a couple of times on the call and improving, and I\u2019m curious if you could just remind us what the peak retention rate was before? And do you think with PEO now and the mix and that being more strategically valuable for customers, holding all else equal, do we think that retention can kind of eclipse the prior highs going forward, maybe just some color on that would be helpful? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think the all-time best was around 82% and as I said we\u2019re approaching that best. I think you make a good point that certainly as you take more products that\u2019s always been part of our model, as you take more products and particularly HR, that drives better retention. But you still have to keep in mind that 80% of our clients are under 20 and many of those still take payroll only and so that will make it more difficult to get that retention much above that kind of all time high we\u2019re always looking to do that there is certainly the possibility is there if they take more products and that their client and that their employees are more tied into things like our mobile app and the technology but I think it\u2019s a little bit tough given the dynamics still at the base. Samad Samana : Great thanks very much for my questions and next quarter guys. Happy holidays. Operator : Thank you, our next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. James Faucette : Hi good morning Efrain and Marty. I just had most of my questions have been answered but I was looking for a little bit of color on a couple of things that you\u2019ve talked about in addition to strong attention, you\u2019ve also mentioned new bookings in payroll anything to call out by market or are you seeing any differences in behavior among mid-market or micro-enterprise, among your customer base within whether it\u2019d be retention and new bookings at all? Martin Mucci : Well, it\u2019s always hard to say before we get through kind of this next this current quarter this third quarter, because the selling season is such an important part of it but we are feeling momentum kind of across the board, whether it\u2019s on the small end of payroll, the mid-market, we\u2019re feeling momentum pretty consistently certainly as well as we\u2019ve talked a lot about the PEO and ASO, time and attendance, retirement, really seeing pretty consistent momentum across the board. James Faucette : Great. And then second question is just as it relates to your partnerships and wondering if it\u2019s if we\u2019re far enough along to see a trend of middle market clients that were exposed to you through partnership transition to complete solutions or how and if they\u2019re mixing and matching with partners? And I guess just trying to get a sense of how you\u2019re managing that potential channel conflict besides looking at incremental opportunities? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think definitely, the sale is about what\u2019s best for the client and what where do they see the most value we certainly try to make sure that we demonstrate to them that, the vast majority of our clients are still taking a full service, full Flex offering, because of the great benefit of a single employee record, a unified user interface that whether you have retirement you\u2019re on one platform no matter how much you grow for payroll and HR, and that it\u2019s fully integrated so when you\u2019re taking Flex, when you just think of what we just offered in the last quarter, the learning management system, the Flex learning management is giving you training, we are building that into some of the bundles, some low \u2013 free training and then you can build and design your own training to tie that into performance management, that ties to your payroll, that ties to your workflow for HR. So I would say the vast majority are still sold as the full bundle, but you do find in the mid-market, there are clients that say, hey, I am just not ready to make a full switch, if I am already up with a retirement provider or a time and attendance solution and okay, if that\u2019s the way you want to do it, we will go with an API and we think that\u2019s efficient. But in the future that also gives us an opportunity to go back to them and say, hey, this would be even better if you bought more services on the Flex platform. James Faucette : Great. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO. Your line is now open. Henry Chien : Hey, guys. It\u2019s Henry Chien calling for Jeff. Thank you for squeezing me in. So lot of stuff was covered. I just wanted to ask sort of big picture question on the Oasis acquisition. So, as we think about the PEO business, I know you touched on it a little bit. What are the kind of synergies that you get from combining sort of two PEO businesses, I know you mentioned there are the carrier relationships, but how does that translate into growth in your business as that let you offer better insurance rate or better products, just sort of what are the benefits of combining two PEO businesses? Martin Mucci : Yes, sure. And it\u2019s very much about again that top line as we have talked about that really the revenue synergy, the growth synergy. So when you talk about like a carrier relationship, we have had very good carrier relationships, but not with all carriers, because of the markets that they are in and we are in. And now when you go into new markets and you have a strong carrier relationship and now you \u2013 let\u2019s say, you double the size or you increase the size tremendously. Now, when you go to those carriers, they are much more interested in giving you more attention to say, hey, let\u2019s give you the best benefit packages, let\u2019s give you some more support as far as the integration with the carrier, you are dealing with the carrier customer support from the carrier, you are just a larger customer and they are going to give you a lot more support therefore you can offer necessarily more benefit options, packages to clients to be able to give to their employees and a better benefit enrollment experience. And so just think of it from that sales perspective. And then just when you think about all of the various markets and then \u2013 so there is that \u2013 that are just additional markets, where they are in that we are not as Efrain said. We have been in primarily Florida, California, Texas and Georgia and they are in different markets. And now we have some clients there, but we weren\u2019t scaled enough necessarily to deal with those carriers. Now we are going to be scaled between the two of us to be larger in those markets that opens up a great possibility. And also you are dealing with a PEO that didn\u2019t have an insurance agency with it. We have an insurance agency that top \u2013 the 20th largest insurance agency. And when you don\u2019t fit the underwriting profile for PEO, they couldn\u2019t go anywhere else for that. We now take these clients and say, hey, if we can underwrite you as a PEO client, I have an insurance agency product that I can offer you for insurance. So now, you have just opened up a whole new opportunity for them and their PEO clients can now buy retirement services from us, they can buy time and attendance solutions from us and a lot of things that were much larger at that they didn\u2019t necessarily offer to a large variety of their customers. Henry Chien : Got it, okay. No, that\u2019s really helpful. And maybe just final question, what\u2019s your sense of the \u2013 I mean, it sounds like that the PEO and sort of these combined HR services are really starting to inflect in your view. I mean, what sort of innings or stage you think of adoption you think PEO is in right now? Martin Mucci : It\u2019s pretty \u2013 I think it\u2019s pretty early, because I don\u2019t see the \u2013 I don\u2019t see the requirements from states or federal government frankly getting that much easier, particularly the states. And I think that more and more clients \u2013 and then as the economy has gotten more, it\u2019s gotten tougher from an unemployment. So, unemployment has gotten lower, harder to find workers, you have gotten a lot of companies, who for the first time have said, okay I really have to offer benefits now. I have to really be sure that I have benefits that I make it easy for my employees to get them or I am not going to track the employees. And by the way, I also have to offer more technology and make it easier for employees to do self-service, to talk, to do things on their mobile phone, to enroll in their benefits, change their benefits and so forth. So I think actually, it\u2019s pretty early innings from adoption of a PEO or frankly any HR outsourcing. Remember that, we are very large in both markets, so PEO is great, ASO is great also and we have over 500 HR people. We are one of the largest obviously and the second largest we will be in this space and that gives us a lot of clout to get in front of clients with technology and service. Henry Chien : Okay, great. I really appreciate that. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we don\u2019t have any more questions on queue. You may proceed. Martin Mucci : Alright. At this point, we will close the call. If you are interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 30 days. I thank you for taking the time to participate in our second quarter press release conference call and for your interest and investment in Paychex. We hope you and your families have a joyful holiday season. Thank you. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer to begin. Martin Mucci : Great, thank you, Laurie. Thank you for joining us for the discussion of the Paychex third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2019. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month. On today's call, I will review business highlights for the third quarter, Efrain will review the third quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal 2019, and then we'll open it up for your questions. Financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 reflected solid progress against our objectives and growth across our major product lines. Our total revenue growth was 14% for the third quarter, management solutions revenue grew 4%, and PEO and insurance services revenues grew a strong 65%, of course reflecting the inclusion of the Oasis Outsourcing Group acquisition. On December 20, 2018 we acquired Oasis, the largest privately held PEO in the U.S., and an industry leader in providing HR outsourcing services for approximately $1.2 billion. We financed this acquisition with $800 million of new long-term debt along with cash-on-hand. Oasis is a great fit for our PEO growth strategy, adding to our scale, expanding relationships with new insurance partners, creating upsell opportunities into the existing Oasis customer base, and augmenting our talent with an addition of an experienced leadership team. Integration of Oasis is in the process with a combination of the Paychex and Oasis PEO leadership teams already complete. We're excited with the experience and talent that comprise this new team and we're confident in their ability to continue to expand our leadership position in the HR outsourcing industry. In fact, Paychex and Oasis, now combined, serve more than 1.4 million work-site employees through our various HR outsourcing services. Execution and operations has been strong as reflected in our clients satisfaction scores and client retention. We continue to be pleased with current retention results, and are on-track to the end of the fiscal year - to end the fiscal year with retention in line with our historic all-time high. Our excellence in customer service was recently recognized as we earned a Stevie Award for Customer Service Department of the year for the third straight year. One of the reasons for this recognition was our use of technology to evolve and improve the clients and their employees service experience. Our strength and focus on technology including self-service options for our clients allows us to proactively respond to the changing preferences of our clients' needs, and thank you to the thousands of Paychex service givers who remain committed to responsiveness, reliability and serving as a trusted business partner to our clients. We've made significant investments in our sales force this year, particularly in our inside sales and mid-market sales teams, and in lead or demand generation. We completed our selling season with improved performance led by our share payroll, HR solutions, PEO, and our inside payroll and insurance sales teams. Our internal sales teams continue to gain ground reflecting improved sales execution and productivity. Our Paychex IHS Markit Small Business Employment Watch has recently showed that small business jobs growth remains pretty flat in this low unemployment economy, and hiring and retaining employees is a major challenge of businesses in this current environment. These factors along with growth and wages are evidence certainly of a tight labor market. Paychex is positioned to help small and mid-sized businesses recruit, hire and retain talent with a broad portfolio of service offerings that allows clients to provide an attractive compensation and benefits package along with opportunities for growth and development of their employees. We continue to enhance Paychex Flex making significant investments designed to simplify the complexity of HR administration. The latest enhancements bring more performance management, workflow approvals, real-time analytics, and a configurable events calendar functionality to the platform. These features are all backed by self-service capabilities that empower employees and administrators to complete tasks from any location on any device. These significant technology product enhancements support our clients in recruiting, onboarding, training and developing their employees in a market where I mentioned it gets increasingly difficult to find and retain employees. In addition to our HR center offering, our broad product set allows our clients to provide competitive benefits including retirement and insurance options. Finally, our clients are supported by a team of over 500 Paychex HR specialists around the country who serve their growing HR needs as states have increasingly made it more challenging to run and grow their businesses without this expertise. We continue to enhance our technology for efficiency through the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the Flex Assistant, our AI chatbot conducts conversations with our clients and their employees in response to a number of service inquiries. We have seen an increasing adoption of our chatbot because of the immediate response and quick and easy-to-understand solutions to customer inquiries, as well as their employees enquiries. This allows for efficiencies for us in internal processes by reallocating resources to more complex tasks. Our Paychex Flex Assistant can cover topics across the human capital management suite, and guides users on how to self-serve if they prefer. The best AI chatbots function through natural language processing to interprete users language to understand and meet their needs. Combining NLP with machine learning enables our bot to quickly learn and adapt, and with the millions of monthly Flex users our chatbot is uniquely positioned to mature rapidly. Earlier this year we launched client self-onboarding e-commerce functionality within our SurePayroll product. We are the first of public company competitors to utilize a true e-commerce technology. Paychex AccountantHQ, our latest technology and service offering designed exclusively for accountants was recognized as a winner in the 2019 Big Innovation Awards presented by The Business Intelligence Group. AccountantHQ provides a unique combination of technology and service allowing accounts the full access to their authorized client data, extensive reporting capabilities, real-time data integration, key account contacts, and an accountant resource library all backed by our industry-leading service model. AccountantHQ's dashboard and robust reporting capabilities allow for efficiencies but also data insights to help accounts deliver greater value as a trusted business partner. We are especially proud to have been recently recognized for the eleventh time by Ethisphere Institute as one of the 2019 World Most Ethical Companies. The center recognizes our fundamental value at Paychex which is to have the very highest ethical business practices for our clients, employees, shareholders and our communities. Thank you to all of our employees for consistently living this Paychex value and earning this recognition. We were also named one of the Top 125 training organizations by Training Magazine for the eighteenth consecutive year, this year climbing up two spots to Number 12. Paychex is dedicated to world-class employee learning and development and takes great pride in our training programs. Our training and development team empowers our employees to embrace a career-long approach to learning and development. I'll conclude by emphasizing that our state-of-the-art technology, full suite of integrated HCM product offerings, and personalized service is a powerful combination that positions us for sustainable growth within our markets. Our employees make this combination successful with their hard work and commitment to our clients each and every day. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the third quarter. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Martin and good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and as such involve risks. Please refer to our earnings release that provides a disclosure on forward-looking statements and related risk factors. In addition, I'll periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These measures include certain discrete tax items and one-time charges. Please refer to our press release and the investor presentation for a discussion of these measures and a reconciliation for the third quarter to their related GAAP measures. I will start by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter and then follow with some greater detail in certain areas. I'll touch briefly on year-to-date results and wrap with a review of our fiscal 2019 outlook and a '20 framework; so look also at the investor presentation, we've got more detail there. Total revenue and total service revenue, both grew 14% for the third quarter to $1.1 billion and $1 billion respectively, our first $1 billion quarter, and hopefully the first of many to come. The acquisition of Oasis in December 2018 accounted for approximately one half of the growth in service revenue. Expenses increased 13% for the third quarter to $641 million and the acquisition of Oasis contributed approximately 12% to this growth. Total expenses for the prior year three months ended February 28, 2018, included as you recall, a one-time bonus paid to non-management employees and a one-time charge following the termination of certain licensing agreements. Total expenses excluding Oasis and these one-time costs in their respective prior year periods increased approximately 9% compared to last year, this 9% growth was primarily driven by increased headcount to investment in the sales force technology resources and operations to support the growth in the business. In addition, an increase in PEO and insurance pass-through costs impacted the quarter. Operating income increased 16% to $429 million. Operating margin was 40.1% for the third quarter comparing to 39.4% for the same period last year. Adjusted operating income which excludes the previously mentioned one-time charge in the prior year quarter increased 7%. I just keep referring you back to both, the presentations we've posted on the investor -- the investor presentation we've posted on the website, it goes through in extensive detail, all of the call outs. Our effective income tax rate was 23.7% for the third quarter compared to 1.1% for the same period last year. The enactment of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act or tax reform in December 2017 resulted in a significant decline in the federal corporate statutory tax rate. In the third quarter last year, we've recognized a net discrete tax benefit of $79 million from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities at this lower rate or at the new lower rate. In addition, during the third quarter last year, we've recognized the fiscal year-to-date catch-up for the lower blended effective tax rate applicable for the fiscal year. These two items resulted in the low 1.1% effective rate for the prior year quarter. we anticipate that the effective tax rate before any discrete tax items will be approximately 24% for the full year fiscal 2019; again I'll refer back to the investor presentation. Net income decreased 12% to 325% for the third quarter, primarily due to significant tax impacts I just discussed, partially offset by the one-time charge following termination of certain licensing agreements, also recognized in last year's third quarter. Adjusted net income increased 3%, adjusted net income to non-GAAP measure that excludes the one-time charge related terminations of the licensing agreements, the tax benefit to revaluation of deferred tax liabilities, and excess tax benefits related to employee stock-based comp which we call out. However, this measure still incorporates the impact of the year-to-date catch-up for the lower blended federal corporate statutory rate recognized in the third quarter last year which is monitoring the growth for the current period. Diluted earnings per share decreased 11% to $0.90 for the third quarter but adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 3%. These growth trends reflect the same factors as discussed for net income, and again, I'd refer you back to the investor presentation which details it. I will now provide some additional color in selected areas. Management Solutions revenue which includes payroll service revenue together with our HCM products included to many of our product bundles increased 4% to $802 million for the third quarter. Lessor contributed less than 1% to the growth, the remaining increase was driven primarily by growth in client bases across our HCM Services, and growth in revenue per check which improved as a result the price increases net of discounts. PEO and insurance; it increased 65% to $246 million for the third quarter. Excluding Oasis PEO and insurance service revenue would have increased 17% for the third quarter, and this growth was primarily driven by the continued strong demand for our combined PEO services which along with WSE growth, the worksite employee growth in our existing client base has resulted in solid growth and client worksite employees served. Our insurance service revenue benefit from growth in the number of health and benefits applicants, the rate of growth for insurance services was moderated by softness in the workers comp market. As state insurance funds declined, we expect this trend in workers comp revenue to persist, and we expect it to persist into next year more to follow on that, it will have a modest impact. Interest on funds held for clients; it increased 27% for the third quarter, $23 million, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates earned. Average balances for interest on funds held clients were down for the third quarter, primarily driven by the impacts of lower client employee tax withholdings resulting from tax reform and client base mix, partially offset by wage inflation. Investments and income; our goal as you know is to protect principle and optimize liquidity, we continue to invest in high credit quality securities, the long-term portfolio currently has an average yield of 2.1%, and an average duration of 3.1 years, our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 2% for the third quarter, up from 1.5% last year. Year-to-date results; let me briefly summarize where we've been for this nine month period. Management solutions revenue is up 4%, PEO and insurance revenue increased 40%, 23% without Oasis and 17% organic. Interest on funds held for clients increased 28% driven by interest rate increases, partially offset by the impact of a 2% decline in average invested balances. Total revenue; this includes obviously Oasis, up 10%. Operating margins were 37.8%, tempered by accelerated investments in the business and growth in PEO direct insurance costs. Net income increased 4% and adjusted net income increased 12%. Diluted earnings per share increased 3% but adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 12%. Let's go through the highlights of our financial position; it remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $886 million as of February 28, 2019. We had a strong cash flow quarter, even though we utilized part of our cash to pay for the Oasis acquisition. Funds held for clients as of the February 28, 2019 were $5.4 million compared to $4.7 billion as of May 31, 2018. Funds held for clients, as you know, very widely on a day-to-day basis averaging $4.4 billion for the third quarter and $3.9 billion for the nine months. Total available for sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized losses of $10 million compared with $38 million as of May 31, 2018. Total stockholders' equity was $2.6 billion as of Feb 28, 2019 reflecting $604 million in dividends paid and $33 million of shares repurchased during the last -- I'm sorry, the first nine months of fiscal 2019. Our return-on-equity for the past 12 months was a formidable 42%. Cash flows from operations were $1 billion for the nine months, an increase of 3% from the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher net income and non-cash adjustments, partially offset by working capital fluctuations, working capital fluctuations related to timing around collections and related tax payments for the combined PEO business, a decrease in accrued liability balances in connection with the termination of certain licensing agreements in fiscal 2018. Now turning to 2019 guidance; I will discuss the guidance for full year fiscal 2019. I'd remind you that our outlook is based upon our current view of economic conditions continuing with no significant changes. We maintain our guidance as provided last quarter with including the overlay on Oasis which I'll talk about in a second. I will reiterate these guidance ranges and provide some color where applicable. And then, just finally to remind everyone; I'll give the guidance first excluding any anticipated impact from the Oasis acquisition then followed with the anticipated impact of Oasis on our results. And I would say this; some of you have updated your models for the inclusion of Oasis, some have not, and so we thought that it made more sense and was better to be very clear to say here is what our base guidance is, and then the overlay of Oasis; so just remember that as I walk through this. So excluding Oasis, management solutions expected to grow approximately 4% PEO and insurance anticipated to grow in the range of 18% to 20%, interest on funds held for clients anticipated to grow 20% to 25%, total revenue anticipated to grow in the range of 6% to 7%, operating income as a percent of total revenue anticipated to be approximately 37%, interest income net anticipated to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2019 expected to be approximately 24%. Net income and diluted earnings per share anticipated to grow approximately 4%. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, are both expected to increase in the range of 11% to 12%. We give the guidance this way so there can be no confusion as the fact that we're tracking exactly to the plan that we set at the beginning of the year and don't blend or confuse the info on Oasis. So now let's talk about it when we include Oasis. It's anticipated as we said previously, they have an incremental impact on total revenue in the range of $155 million to $175 million in fiscal 2019. As we refine these numbers, we think that that number is going to be on the lower end of that range, in the low $160 million. Excluding one-time costs related to the acquisition, Oasis is anticipated to have minimum impact on earnings per share; now when we include one-time acquisition and integration costs, we anticipate the impact on diluted earnings per share to be approximately $0.03 per share for fiscal 2019. That's consistent with what we've said previously, a little more color on where we fall within that $155 million to $175 million, and that really has everything to do with the way we are looking at pass-through costs in that business. I'll provide you with a little additional color for the last quarter of the year. Consistent with how we guided our last quarter's call, we anticipate that management solutions revenue growth in Q4 will be below the full year rate due to the anniversary, primarily among other things of the Lessor acquisition. We still think that management solutions will fall between 3% and 4%. Last quarter we indicated that for Q3 we anticipated PEO and insurance services revenue increase in the range of 15% to 17%, and for Q4 to be in the range of 10% to 13%. Growth in Q3 came in at the high-end of the guidance range we provided last quarter, and we now expect growth for Q4 to be approximately 9%, so below that range. There is two reasons for that, there was some timing of revenue that shifted between quarters on the insurance side; and despite this, we anticipate achieving our full year guidance range. We'll talk a little bit more about what we're saying as we talk about the '20 guidance but there is also a little bit of softness on the workers comp portion of our insurance revenue that pulls that revenue down a bit. Now, let me talk about 2020 and I would just caveat everything I'm saying by saying that we haven't completed our planning process but we thought given the Oasis acquisition and the fact that you'll need to update models. We thought we'd give you some preview of what we're looking at for the year, including Oasis. We'll provide the detailed guidance during our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter call as we always do, but let me give you some high level commentary based on a preliminary look into next fiscal year. Management solutions revenue growth, we anticipate it to be comparable to the growth in 2019. PEO and insurance revenue excluding Oasis is anticipated to reflect low double-digit growth; so that means about in the range of around 10%. Including Oasis, PEO and insurance services revenue growth will be in the range of 30% to 35% with growth higher in the first half of the year until the anniversary of the Oasis acquisition. Operating margins, at this stage we think will be in the range of 37% to 38%, we'll see where we end this year but that anticipates some improvement, some leverage on the base business. We anticipate Oasis will contribute revenue in the range of $355 million to $375 million next year, and is going to be largely neutral to earnings per share. With the significance of the interest expense and amortization expense associated with the Oasis acquisition, we introduced a discussion of EBITDA margins. Please refer to the investor presentation on our IR webpage for the calculation of EBITDA for the first nine months of fiscal 2019. We anticipate EBITDA for the full year fiscal 2019 will be approximately 41%, and we expect EBITDA as a percent of total revenue for fiscal 2020 to be consistent with fiscal 2019. And if you look at the way we calculate EBITDA, it's pretty simple and should be pretty easy to follow. I reiterate, these comments are very preliminary and subject to revision as we finalize our plans for next year. I will refer you to our investor slides on our website for more information. By the way, I just wanted to clarify one thing that 37% to 38% is clear on the webpage would exclude -- that operating margin I cited would exclude Oasis. So look at the slide, I think it lays it out pretty clearly. So with that, I'll end my comments and turn it back to Martin. Martin Mucci : Thank you, Efrain. And operator, now we'll open the call to questions please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Damian Wille : This is Damien on for Ramsey, so thanks for taking the questions. I just -- I'm hoping you guys can talk a little bit about your long-term growth expectations for the PEO and insurance revenue. Obviously, you've provided that preliminary framework for 2020 which I really appreciate at the low double-digits but I think -- we're thinking about that more like a mid-teens type of a rate. Can you may be dissect what's going on in there and why the deceleration year-over-year? Martin Mucci : The answer to that is, I gave you PEO and insurance; so our PEO business -- our base PEO business is growing in the teens, insurance pulls that growth rate down a little bit. I would just say that insurance revenue can vary from year to year, it could very well be by the back half of next year, growth in insurance revenue picks up again. So it oscillates. Our PEO growth, we expect it to be in the teens; so that's one thing. And then the second thing is, we'll have to see when we anniversary Oasis what our growth rate coming out of that will be because the numbers are larger. So I think that's the answer to the question. Damian Wille : And on operating margin then for 2020, it's nice to see some of the leverage in the model there. Maybe if you could talk about some places that you guys are looking to invest next year or maybe even in Q4 here and then into next year. Like, what are the places that you guys are going to invest in and how that kind of plays into your operating margin expectations? Thanks. Efrain Rivera : I would say that as we get into next year, we identified areas where we would invest this year as part of tax reform, and so there will be a continuation of those three broad buckets of investment; not at the same level that we invested this year certainly on a net basis, meaning we're getting some benefits from it so you don't -- you won't see the same level of net spend that you saw this year. But we will continue to invest in marketing and sales, I think a little bit less in sales. And on the marketing side, continue to invest in operational efficiencies and then continue to work on IP and products. Martin? Martin Mucci : Yes. One of the other things as Efrain mentioned, those are the same things, you'll see a continuation of that and a little bit lower but the product acceleration would be the other one that -- to the ones that Efrain mentioned. So lead generation, demand generation has been our big focus for us, a lot more leads coming in over the web, and I really think we're hitting our stride through some of the programs we've put in place at the beginning of this fiscal year to drive more demand and nurture those leads because so many more are coming in that way, and then handling them is well through internal sales, so we really continue to invest there. Product acceleration, these were things that we were going to do; we accelerated particularly into this quarter a lot of product around HR, what we call our HR center and enhancing that with data analytics, learning management system to provide training for our employees and their clients, and performance management among other things. So product acceleration, lead generation and operating efficiencies, as well using some of the work we've done in our chatbots and chat and other self-service capabilities that our clients were looking for. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Amit Singh : This is actually Amit Singh for Jason. You guys just went through your key selling season; so what were the key takeaways from there? Anything that stood out as being different this year versus the past couple of years in terms of competition, pricing, etcetera? Martin Mucci : I think the competitive environment is about the same, we didn't see a big change there. We feel year-to-date we're really seeing the best-selling seasons selling, frankly, in [PAR] [ph] growth that we've had in a few years; so that was -- that continued. I think it was moderated a little bit in January -- in the December-January kind of timeframe with -- between the government shutdown, the market kind of dropping and then rebounding, and etcetera. So we saw a little moderation there but really when you look at the selling season overall, for [PAR] [ph] growth, it's been -- we don't really give the number but it's the best we've seen in 3 years and certainly year-to-date it's the same thing. So we're feeling great momentum, particularly on the HR Solutions and PEO side of the business, insurances -- health insurance, and our inside sales piece as well. Amit Singh : And then just expanding on that competitive dynamics into your PEO market and especially as we look at your fiscal '20 guidance versus '19. There has been some strong growth for a while there, but is it now getting noticeably more crowded? Martin Mucci : Actually, I think we're building even more strength with adding Oasis and now serving through the various -- not just PEO but our other HR outsourcing solutions of 1.4 million worksite employees, we've build a real strength and we expect to capitalize on that with carrier relations, the insurance carrier relations expanding into other states and selling our products into the Oasis base as well. So as Efrain said, I think if you look at the whole PEO and insurance segment, it's moderated a bit but a lot of that coming from the insurance side of it, and particularly, workers comp which -- I think you know cycles, were kind of in a down rate environment which has actually picked up pretty quickly, and so once those state funds lower their insurance rates and the impact on the overall workers comp rates have come down, that's really accelerated in the last couple of months and that's going to put some moderation on the PEO and insurance line. But the PEO itself, we expect still to be very strong and particularly with the recent acquisition with Oasis, of course, and HROI as well, we feel very good about the leadership teams there and the integration that's already underway. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. James Schneider : Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you can maybe go a little further on the selling season commentary you had a minute ago. Marty, just given what you've seen from Oasis thus far, what's been the reaction from clients with respect to the addition of that to your product portfolio? And I guess, more broadly speaking, heading into fiscal '20, do you feel kind of incrementally better or worse about the growth and that kind of the core payroll franchise revenue growth heading into next year? Martin Mucci : I think starting with the PEO, I think we've gotten good positive feedback from clients. I think Oasis already had a strong feeling from their clients, and the leadership; Mark Perlberg, who has been running Oasis and is leading our PEO as we combine it. We're selling -- we're really designing a great balance of selling into new clients and selling into the base as well. Of course, we have a Top 20 insurance agency that now -- Oasis can use the strength of that, so where insurance is not a good fit on the PEO model, you can now add Oasis clients as -- in new sales like we've done, can now go to the insurance agency to be able to get insurance; so we're adding some strength there, of course, they had different carriers relationship levels than we did and so we're expanding into a new states. So I think the reaction has been good the opportunity is great, and I think the integration is going very well from that standpoint. On the core payroll side, I think that competition has continued to be about the same, it's competitive; the pricing though hasn't changed a lot, I think we still have some pricing power there. We'd always like to see that growth a little stronger but it's also the way we're leading our sales now, we're leading much more with HR overall; so we're selling more bundles, we're selling more into the PEO and HR outsourcing, and you're not getting quite as much of the demand for payroll-only, and that's exactly how we expected it. So I think you're seeing price and level of competition the same there, it's okay, it's not as strong as we'd like but I think it's moving exactly the way we thought toward more HR. Now in the SurePayroll side, for example, I mentioned that we just introduced an e-commerce option; we're seeing that that is helping not only accept more leads but gain more clients that way. It's early in the process but what you're finding is, if a client comes in and can complete the entire transaction on their own or get help from our internal sales teams if they needed, and kind of complete the whole thing on an e-commerce platform that's pretty strong as far as capturing the client when they're looking instead of getting a lead and then trying to reach the client who may have decided to go somewhere else because they couldn't talk to someone or complete the transaction. So, I'm thinking we're seeing some positive growth there and we're -- and they're doing, and we're seeing some strong growth on the low end because of that. James Schneider : And then maybe relative to the margin outlook you're providing for fiscal '20; it looks like on an apples-to-apples basis, you're calling for margin expansion of a little bit over 50 bips [ph] if I'm not mistaken. So I guess, could you maybe just kind of clarify relative to the reinvestments you've been making, do you feel like you have all the investment you need on the product side at this point to the extent you're going to get incremental leverage off of that investment from [indiscernible]? And then maybe Efrain, you can just clarify what the expected operating margin directly [ph] from Oasis will be for fiscal '20 roughly speaking? Efrain Rivera : Jim, let me -- those are all interrelated; so you carefully parse what we said, as usual. We said that this year's guidance excluding Oasis, operating margins would be approximately $37, and then the preliminary framework we're saying is between $37 and $38, that would imply exactly what you said. I would caveat one thing Jim, that -- obviously, we could end up a little bit stronger than $37 in which case the leverage will be a little bit less but the premise to your question is valid. So what's happening is that when we invested in year one, you don't see the benefits or the results of that investment in the -- in year one. You get into year two, you're continuing to invest and you start to now get benefits from investments made in year one, that's why I carefully said the net spend that we have relative to the investments we made after tax reform goes down; so you're seeing that in the margin. And the second thing before I turn it over to Marty to talk a little bit more about that is to say that 'when we think about what that spending has done and will do for us, it becomes a down payment for a roadmap to the future where we're additional opportunities for leverage exists.' Marty mentioned the investments we've made in things like chatbots using AI, NLP, machine learning; and not to be overlooked or things like the e-commerce developments we've put into SurePayroll. And again, we are the first publicly traded company that has created that platform. So all of those now have become things that we can leverage in the business to drive further efficiencies and in some cases, also in additional sales. So, we're getting benefits, it's opening up other pathways that we hadn't considered and that will be a benefit to us in the future. Martin Mucci : Yes, So, I think everyone's pretty much covered. The investments we made kind of from the tax reform that we talked about starting really last year was that that would do that from a product standpoint. We accelerated the product. In fact, a lot of that rolled out in the first two quarters and then in this quarter from an HR center perspective, we're very happy with that, that we were able to accelerate that. And then on the efficiencies, a lot of it has also been done to create those operating efficiencies. And the chatbot, for example, someone who wants to chat or have a quick answer to a question, 40%, 45% now, I think this last month, are already being answered only by the chatbots. So it doesn't have to go to a live person to handle through chat or live talk. And that is creating some nice efficiencies. And we're able to increase the productivity of our payroll specialist and across the board actually. So we're actually the chat bot staff in the work that's automated response is going much faster. And I said, given the millions of clients and employees, client employees that have using this, the machine learning is really creating things very quickly. Last month we had -- a month and a half ago, we had about 45 questions answered by the chatbot, different questions that it would accept. Now it's over 100 already because of the machine learning piece of that. Efrain Rivera : And if I can build on that, it's part of it it's a productivity play, but another part is serving the client better. And so at the end of the day, when you combine that technology with our world-class service capability, you've got a pretty powerful service differentiator. So we're pretty excited about where we are. James Schneider : Great. And can you just quickly clarify the drag from [indiscernible]? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Hey, Jim. So, if you look at the page where I put the -- what we put on the IER presentation there, you can do the calculations to get there. You'll see what the impact is. I would say this, the drag year-over-year from an EBITDA perspective is modest and I would say also from an operating margin perspective back then when you go through the calculations, you can call me later on that to make sure you got it. It's not dramatic. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Berkley of Wolfe Research. James Berkley : Thanks, guys. I guess just to start, if you could just help us understand the $20 million range, just what's keeping you from having a little more visibility, I guess, into the contribution from Oasis in the fourth quarter and then some thoughts on costs and revenue synergies over time. Any signs you may be able to accelerate the upselling part of your payroll days, just given the acquisition of Oasis and how much it will reinvest in port, not in the sales force. Efrain Rivera : So, if you look at it, you have line of sight to what it was in Q3. I've given you a number that's pretty clear. I think it can get to where we think we're going to land. So, I'm reticent to keep changing guidance because we're falling within the range. And I think at this point I called out what I thought the contribution for the first or for the back half of the year is going to be, if you look in the presentation we've detailed what Oasis was for the quarter, about 70 million detailed what it is for Q4. I think we've given a pretty clear roadmap in terms of what we think it will be for the balance of the year. James Berkley : Okay, understood. I just didn't want to change it there. Just commenting on the cost and revenue synergies over time if you don't mind. Efrain Rivera : I think from a cost standpoint, I think a lot of it actually we've already started. There were some synergies of duplication of people. Some of that's already been done and I think we're pretty much far down the road on that one. We also are looking at, obviously, from a cost standpoint, what can we do with the carriers to get better costs and plans in place. And we'll be working those through. It's a little bit early on that one, but we're working through that right now. Organization is in place and the product strategy is working through right now. I don't see a lot of needs of technology investment that needs to be done there right now. So, that should be pretty solid. Sales team is pretty clear on who's got what already that's in place. And I think the cost synergies will again be people, but pretty much done insurance carriers and rates there to lower our cost efficiency and frankly handling -- and I guess I'd say on the revenue side selling more obviously and being able to capture some retirement products in there and more insurance to the degree. We couldn't underwrite them. We drive them to our insurance agency like we do for our PEO. That's something that Oasis did not have before either and now we'll be able to use. So, we haven't laid out all the quantification. I think in the guidance you see kind of overall where we think it's going to be and frankly, the short-term impact is pretty moderate to the EPS, so we feel pretty good about the margins and everything there. James Berkley : Okay, thanks. And then just more generally real quick, I mean, I know, your focus is obviously shifting towards PEO and it's become increasingly important given the ACA and the 50 employee insurance mandate, et cetera. Just could you give any numbers or just an idea just in how much white space you see out there and what percent of the adjustable market's unpenetrated right now and just kind of talk to your longer-term strategy in the space going forward, whether it's around M&A or organic growth, et cetera? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think it's going to be both. I mean primarily organic growth, but we'll continue to look for opportunities like Oasis and other PEOs. And really, it looks like more of an HR outsourcing opportunity because what's changed is a few years ago, the average client size, the needed HR needed retirement, those things, was I would say 25, 30 employees plus. That has come down pretty dramatically. You know, as you've seen the states increase their regulations, that may have come down a bit, but the states have really increased the enforcement and the regulations that they have on things like immigration and whether your workers are legit or not, the retirement plans, the need for retirement plans, all of that has been pushed up and a lot of requirements and the enforcement has picked up where they're looking for revenue from fees and enforcement. So the need for HR has really grown. So I think there's a lot of white space there. There's a lot of opportunity and it's growing as well. And so you have to be someone who, through your technology and your service, can give that kind of a complete set. So not only are you helping in a tough and a low unemployment market, the first thing you hear constantly in our surveys is I need help recruiting and retaining employees because it's so tough out there to get them. So, you have to offer benefits of a large company, whether you're a smaller or mid, you have to offer benefits, you have to offer mobility options so people can do things. 70% of our clients employees expect that they should be able to do everything on their phone. They don't want to talk to anyone in HR. They don't want to go online. They want every -- or certainly not on paper. They want to do everything mobile.  And that's all the products that we've been introducing and linking together for a total HR experience. So that helps you bring in employees and it helps you retain and develop your employees so that they stay. And that's exactly what we're responding to. Like retirement, signing up retirement used to be a heavy paper-intensive process for your employees. You want a retirement plan, you push it out there, it's all paper. It's tough to do. You now can have an employee set up their retirement in four clicks on a mobile app, on our mobile app. So, you're making the small and midsize business more competitive and helping them continue to retain those employees as well. Efrain Rivera : The other thing, James, I'd say is maybe PAYX publishes some data on this, but if you look at the 20 and above space and the amount of worksite employees, which is probably the best way to dimension the opportunity, you're in the multiple tens of millions of worksite employees. If you take the top four PEOs, you barely get to 2 million worksite employees. Now, there are more worksite employees serviced by smaller PEOs. But when you compare that to the amount of worksite employees that exist in 20 and above, which is where now and may in the future be 10 and above, where the sweet spot PEO goes, you have a significant amount of white space and the penetration rates in the low-single is in the mid to low-single digits. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much. I just wanted to continue the discussion on the PEO space. Are you going to market differently with your Oasis product versus your legacy Paychex product? Martin Mucci : I would say in the short-term probably a little bit differently just because of the brand and so forth and we're working through that now. But the package is what you would say is Oasis has gone more into obviously brand-new clients that have not been on a PEO or any other service with our base, we're working through the client base as well. So we have a team that sells into the client base who has that need and can graduate, I guess I'd say to a PEO. And Oasis and some of the other rest of the team is selling brand new clients to the PEO or HR concept. So a little bit different there. We'll be fixing the brand as we work through what's the best way to approach that, but generally, they're both selling. This is an HR support package that is there. Whether you take the insurance through us or whether we underwrite it through the agency, you have full retirement and payroll and HR administration packages. And so, I would say at a high level, it certainly is being marketed the same way because that's the need of the client that we see out there. Jeff Silber : Okay. I know during the last recession this was a relatively small piece of the business. I'm not even sure if Oasis was even around then, but can you give us your expectations of what you think might happen in this business if God forbid we go into any type of downturn in the U.S? Martin Mucci : Well, I think, from an HR standpoint, sometimes in a recession you need HR support more than ever. Certainly, on the small business side that's only payroll for example, you have small businesses, more of them go out of business and fewer of them start up. So you always have some hits there. But I think by expanding and really becoming much more of an HR company and having retirement offerings, insurance offerings, and a much more complete package, that makes us much more resistant to a downturn in the economy. And that's the way we looked at it for the last few years is we've positioned the company to be much more of an HR outsourcing company than just payroll. That's because that is actually more in need in those difficult times. Now you need much more HR decisions to say, \"Hey, what do I do with pay increases? What do I do with insurance offerings? How do I cut costs but keep my people? That's when you need the personalized HR support that we get with over 500 HR generalist. At the same time, the technology, frankly, will make you more efficient as our clients are. Our clients are becoming much more efficient because of our mobile app that they use now that they don't -- if a client employee now needs to change their address and the system [ inaudible 00 :52:42] the old days, they go to their HR person or their business owner, they'd have to call us. They would talk to us, they would change it. They don't do any of that now. Now they say to the employee, \"You can change it yourself. You can go in on your mobile app and do everything basically.\" So all those things, the technology changes, the HR focus, the total package that makes us really more resistant and stronger in a recession type era. Efrain Rivera : So, just to build on what Marty said, if you look at it from a product standpoint, obviously that sticky from a client-side standpoint, you have more resilience because clients typically are larger in a PEO. So, in our payroll, if your payroll only attend to be smaller PEO clients are in a higher size package, which gives them a little bit more ability to withstand a downturn in the economy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson. Lisa Ellis : Good morning, guys. My first question is related to the ecommerce capability describing for SurePayroll. Can you just talk a little bit more broadly? Is there a big like digital marketing push accompanying this? So, the concept being to get the small business owner over the weekend or whatever sort of Google searching and end up finding Paychex and SurePayroll and being able to onboard entirely independently. Is that sort of -- can you just give a little bit more color around like where this is headed? Martin Mucci : Yes, it is. It's actually a continuation of -- what we saw was with lead generation, we're doing much stronger job with getting the leads and getting -- typically it's more of a form fill out and then we get back to them where the client context is somehow through the lead and says, \"Get back to me.\" Well, what's the hardest thing to do is get back to a client today, get anyone to answer the phone. So, what we found with ecommerce is not only is it responsive to a client the way they want to set themselves up when they want to do it, weekend nights or whatever, but also that you captured that lead because now you don't have to get back to them. The client will start themselves, they'll compare, they'll see the price, they'll see the product they decided to buy, they're in the mix. And even if they get halfway into it and need to help, that's fine. We have someone ready at all times to be able to just go to someone, either through chat or direct line and talk to them to help them through the process. But you've captured them now as opposed to trying to reach back to them. And that's what I've been, one of the strongest findings through the ecommerce is lead generation is great, but closing that lead at the time that the prospect wants to close it is huge. So that's been the biggest benefit of this thing. Efrain Rivera : And I'd say that it's not in the future where we launched in Q2 and it's up and running. Lisa Ellis : Okay. And then on a related note around the investments around technology you've been talking about, do you have initiatives underway that are leveraging your underlying database of employment related data? Meaning you can feed back things like benchmarks or give guidance and advice. Martin Mucci : Yes, that's already been released. And given the size of our client base and employees of our clients, that can give great data. So we get data, for example, on turnover and there's -- obviously it's had a gross basis kind of pulled together, but it can do it by size as well, size of clients or size of your business and so forth. So yes, we're giving data analytics, something that's been very important to our clients to get data analytics. And most small to mid-size businesses could never get at that data or ever pay for that data in the market that we can give them very quickly using our very large client base. Lisa Ellis : Okay, great. And then just last one, Marty, can you just summarize, give really good color around the macroeconomic indicators you see in your business that give you a sense for the overall health of the economy? Can you just run through those meaning employment growth, wage growth and new business formation, etcetera? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think what we've seen, and the small business index is really focused on 50 employees and below, what we've seen is obviously job growth has kind of flattened out here the last few months. And most of that is because there aren't the people out there to hire. So we're still seeing job growth, but the change in job growth is really flattened out to last year down a little bit flat. And we're seeing it kind of across all sectors. You are seeing wage growth probably in the 2.5% to 2.7% range, which has been good. It's coming up. And of course, those earning the least are getting the biggest increases. So they're seeing and those earning minimum wage, etc. because of the minimum wage increases across the country are seeing 3.5% 4% wage increase, sometimes a little bit more where salaried or the higher wage earners are seeing 2% or below 2% is what we're seeing. And that's kind of averaging out. Across all sectors in jobs, manufacturing kind of has been up and down, but it's down a bit now. Construction is still probably one of the better ones. Other services overall is the strongest, which is discretionary services. There are more part-time jobs. So again, you're seeing a little bit more growth there and a little bit more wage increases there because of a minimum wage changes. Overall, it feels steady, not necessarily heading it, it doesn't feel like it's heading into a recession, it's just job growth has kind of flattened out because it's tough to find people. What we are seeing also is hearing from our clients anecdotally that there is more of those on the fringe that maybe high school graduates instead of college that they're bringing in and training more. So again, for our products it's helpful because they're looking for more training, bring people on that may not have hired before but trying to train them because it's so difficult to find people. And we actually have heard on the negative side probably some businesses saying, \"Hey, I'm not taking some work because I can't find enough people to do it more in the trades and that kind of thing.\" And regionally it's in the south, it's still the strongest, energy has picked back up. So it's been used in tax and Dallas look better. And of course, the Florida, Georgia, generally that area is better for construction both residential and commercial. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair & Company. Tim McHugh : Thanks. I just wanted to follow-up on the worker's comp part of the insurance. How big is that versus kind of health insurance in terms of importance for your insurance business? And can you elaborate a little bit more on the issue? Is it just a down pricing market or is there more happening there I guess? Efrain Rivera : So, two parts, Tim. And I want to make sure that it's clear. When we say PEO and insurance and we call out softness and worker's comp, we're calling out specifically the worker's comp revenue in our insurance agency. We're not specifically referring to PEO worker's comp, which is separate conversation. That really is around that. That's a separate discussion. So, roughly, half of our insurance business is worker's comp premiums. And if you look at where we are this year and look at PEO and insurance is about 30% of that number, a little bit less than that it will go to 20% in terms of composition of that revenue. When you look at the insurance and desegregate that part about half worker's comp, half health and benefits, health and benefits is doing fine, you know upper single digit growing reasonably. And workers' comp is where we've seen softness really starting a couple of quarter or so ago and accelerating. And the worker's comp market goes through cycles. So if we had had this discussion a couple of years ago, we would've said, \"Hey, worker's comp is doing great. Premium are up and we're getting our share but the market is soft.\" And when it turns, who knows? But it goes through cycles. We're going through a bit of a softening cycle now. Tim McHugh : Okay. Fair enough. And can I follow-up on the comments on the selling season? I guess it sounded like obviously it's good overall results, but it sounded much more about telling the broader bundle services than it didn't necessarily client growth. And in particular, I guess for the legacy payroll businesses. Is that accurate, I guess? And can you elaborate on what you're seeing in terms of the ability to grow the client base further for that core kind of payroll [indiscernible] services. Efrain Rivera : Hey, Tim Martin can provide color commentary on the selling season. I would just caution to infer that we weren't saying something about unit growth is not a correct assumption. And obviously we don't give the client base per se, but I would say generally we came into the year expecting that the client base would grow and we haven't been disappointed. So, that's what I'd say about unit growth. And Martin can talk a little bit about selling season. Martin Mucci : Yes, I think maybe what -- three off a little bit there. I mean, we had the solid sales growth across the board. In the first half of the year in the third quarter, there was some moderation on the payroll side, but we still had -- probably, when you look overall, we had our best part of growth in three years I'd say and certainly year to date and in that selling season overall. I think on the small business payroll side, I think it was impacted by some things that happened there, but I think we still had good sales, particularly on the inside sales piece and we would expect the see the HR piece stronger because that's what we're pushing the most even and the payroll side, even small business payroll sales folks are leading with the complete package now. We just found that what the clients were looking for. So I think it was a decent selling season and has continued where we've been through the year as good solid growth year-over-year in park. Tim McHugh : Okay. Just ones up there, when you say inside sales team, is that mostly SurePayroll and the some worksite [ph] employee or what's the market that's served by that part of the sales force? Martin Mucci : Yes, I'm sorry. Inside sales is not just SurePayroll, it's a pretty good size of sales team, which we've been increasing and they handle frankly, all products as well, but the way they saw everything inside. And they take a lot of the leads, particularly in the small end, they take a lot of the leads that come over the web, but will sell all products over the phone. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JP Morgan. Tien- tsin Huang : On the worksite employee front, is it fair to think that units are growing faster than the 17% given lower pass-through's and we see declines in some of the other pressures? It seems like WSE is growing at a good pace. Martin Mucci : WSEs are growing -- I would say in the range, Tien-tsin. If we were in the quarter it's comparable, I would say. It's a little bit actually below, but in that range. Tien- tsin Huang : Not strong nonetheless then, okay. Then secondly, just to ensure payroll, do you feel like you've narrowed the gap versus some of the call it the Silicon Valley guys on the distribution front, forget about the product and they talk a lot about product, which is of the distribution side. Do you feel like you've managed to get there? Martin Mucci : I think the gap was wider and how much better we were then them, but I think we compete very effectively with the kind of the west coast that are out there. I think pricing wise we've come up with some new ways to price as well and to capture that client through things like ecommerce that we've been talking about. So yes, I think we're very competitive with them and frankly, I've seen excellent productivity in sales out of those teams, they've done very well. And the ecommerce, I think as Efrain mentioned as well is really taking off. Efrain Rivera : Tie-tsin, meshing up your question with Tim's, increasingly to understand the business, you have to go at it in a multichannel approach. You have to figure out what the right blend of feed on the street is internal telesales and then web-based ecommerce sales. And I would say the third piece of that troika was with the ecommerce-based sales. SurePayroll was given that capability and it looks like that opportunity may be additive to the other channels, not necessarily substitute for the other channels. So, we're looking at the results. We got real time data showing us and increasingly in the future to be successful selling not just payroll but HR too. You've got to have a capability in all three of those channels, both over the web direct without a salesperson, field-based sales for the right kind of clients and internal telesales. And our competitors are also playing with that mix to try to figure out what makes sense. I think you need to have all three pieces. Then we have the pieces in place. Now we're in the process of fine-tuning each of those three pieces. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of Baird. Mark Marcon : What's the things that you're doing? I've got a ton of questions, but I'll limit it to a couple. With regards to just what you're doing on the ecom sales, what percentage of the SurePayroll sales are now coming through that channel? Martin Mucci : Well, it's pretty small. We started in the last quarter, it was in second quarter and so it's still pretty small, but I think it's going to be growing pretty substantially. And as Efrain, I think Efrain made a very good point there that it we think in addition. So, it's capturing that lead that's coming in and somebody's ready to buy right at that time and doesn't want to call back. And so, I think we're expecting that this will be in addition to kind of the other channels that we've had. Mark Marcon : And so, I imagine you're going to end up expanding it across the board in terms of offering this... Martin Mucci : That would be very likely. Yes. Mark Marcon : And then with regards to micro segmenting the payroll and HCM market, can you describe the different dynamics when you're taking a look at the growth that you're seeing right now? We've traditionally talked about different sub segments whether it's truly small sub six employees versus six to 20 versus slightly higher and then getting into MMS, where are you seeing the strongest growth? Efrain Rivera : So, I would say in part because of these technology advances, Mark, we're seeing strong growth in the micro segment. I think we're seeing a reasonable growth in the, I'm going to call it the 5 to 50 a segment, and then mid-market modest. I would say at this point largely due to the fact that the level of competition there is very high. I would add one thing though, if I now say, let's talk about client segment instead of by product and peril, but by client size, now what we see is that 20 and above is increasingly fragmenting into a MMS market and a PEO market. And then on the PEO side, we're doing very, very well. So, if you think about PEO as comprehensive outsourcing, you were just with an SP [ph], it's all your note. If you look at what's happening in that market it's pretty clear that there's a trend in the market towards comprehensive outsourcing and what we're seeing '20 and above is exactly the same thing. So in our system we either are going to go with that client with potentially an MMS rep or in our mid-market rep or through PEO, and in some cases we've incentivize them to cross-pollinate and we're seeing a lot of success on the PEO side. So I think that's a bit of an overview, I think PEO increasingly needs to be overlaid with -- when you talk about mid-market because it's a solution that mid-market clients are interested in. Mark Marcon : Totally makes sense. I have been covering the PEOs since the late 90s, so it's interesting to see the acceleration and the increased interest. When we factor in Oasis, just on the operating margin because our call backs a little bit later and so I hope you indulge me on this. But we're scratching it out and it looks to us like maybe the implication would be like around 30 -- so we were saying 37x to 38x; Oasis maybe 37-ish, and maybe that comes out to more like 35/7, is that with Oasis, is that in the ballpark? Efrain Rivera : You have a very sharp pencil. Overall, you can look at it. I won't call it out specifically but if you do the math, you're not incredibly far off. But I would caution one thing, it's Gregg and I; I would say increasingly, we think about the business also from an EBITDA margin perspective. So we've given you all the pieces there to calculate, we've also called out what we expect the margin to be next year, and there is not a lot of strange adjustments, it's pretty -- it will be very clear on the face of the cash flow statement, and net income to get to a margin number but that's what I'd say about that. And then this is from a longer range -- and from a really longer term perspective, there is two different dynamics that are occurring. One is you're early on in terms of the implementation of some of these efficiency measures as it relates to chatbot, and everything that that can end up doing from an efficiency in a service model perspective which would obviously increase margins. On the flipside we've got adding PEO which -- it's growing faster so from a mix perspective that's going to drive the margins down. How do we think about the balance of those two from a longer term investor expectation perspective? Martin Mucci : So Mark, I guess I would say two things on that. One is assuming current mix when we get through the full year of Oasis, we would expect to come into 2021 and proving Mark margins off the '20 base; so that would be your expectation. Caveating it as I've been saying for 18 months, that if PEO growth accelerates even faster than we anticipate, which is still good -- teams growth, then that could impact that perspective. The other thing that could impact it is, I called out what management solutions; management solutions growth in that area because it carries a higher margin, it would be an offset but I think those are all the factors that as you plug in a model you'd have to evaluate. Mark Marcon : And then Marty, one last one; the client scores with regards to the clients that are being serviced through the chatbots; how is that trending relative to more traditional? Martin Mucci : Yes, very, very good. We look at it from a number of ways, we don't always get them to do enough client sat but you get to that early, getting at -- we're watches very closely is; we just had a meeting on this earlier this week. How much or how many of the questions are answered in the first question that they ask, how many are going to a service provider because they're not getting the answer; and that's being refined all the time. What we're seeing is that increase from 40% are being answered by the chatbot itself, now up to 45% in just a month. And I think if we look out three months or six months from now, I think that would be -- we're hoping that that is quite a bit higher. And that will be -- that's an indication to us that they're getting their answer you know. Now we also have other feedback channels and so far we're getting good feedback that the answer is being there. And again, you start with 30 questions, then it goes to 50; now we're over 100 because of the machine learning part of that of refining the question and understanding the natural language of what's the client asking for? What are they really asking for? And are we responding with the right answer. So it's pretty early but if there is early stage they have 45% answered by the chatbot itself is very strong we think. So we're getting good positive feedback on that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : I wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions. First, on Oasis, you made it pretty clear that you're tracking pretty close to what you thought; what should we look at as the potential, most likely sources of variants either positively or negative things that you should -- that you're tracking that we should be aware of that could cause some variance there. And then just a follow-up question quickly on the chatbot comments from the last question; it sounds like you're improving the response rate pretty nicely, what's your sense and what are your systems; people telling you as kind of an ultimate feeling for the chatbots at least within a reasonable time frame. Thanks. Martin Mucci : I'll start with that, when I think it's around -- it's still really pretty, early, you know get a lot of great data on this. But I think if we could get 70 in a long-term; if you could get 70% answered by the bot by itself, I think that's pretty strong based on today's standards; so having only been in it pretty early heading towards 50, we feel really good about it. And you do get an awful lot of data, you know big given our use of it, we're able to change it pretty quickly and enhance it based on the number of people that are using it. So I think it's heading towards you -- I think it would be good to add toward a 60% to 70% response because there's always nuances that people may want to talk to a live person but that is changing pretty rapidly. This is really in response to the way that client doesn't as you probably know, most younger clients, in particular, don't want to talk to somebody they just soon chat or and have -- and if it's a chatbot that gets the answer, and by the way this is going to expand pretty dramatically to taking you --- not only answering your question but saying do you want me to take you there? So, where do I find my checked stuff; it's here today, now it says it's here; go here, now next it that will be let me take you there by hitting this. James Faucette : And if the question is how do I do something? It will evolve to video -- short streaming video that will show you in 30 seconds or less this is how you do it or you can contact somebody. So that will all continue to evolve the way the client needs it, first question. Martin Mucci : On Oasis, I think that we have a pretty good handle now on both revenue and expenses in the business, there are targets that we have said internally in terms of cost savings that we're measuring against the business, they are comprehensive in at least the framework that we gave you. So we'll be looking at that and obviously, success winning clients is an important part of the equation as we head into next year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Neil [ph] of Autonomous Research. Unidentified Analyst : Real quick housekeeping question on the preliminary outlook for fiscal 2020. What are your interest rate assumptions on the funds? Martin Mucci : Interest rate assumptions in 20; interest rate assumptions -- we didn't include them in part because we needed to see where the Fed is at this point but we would assume that there really are not going to be rate increases there, so you'd see some modest increase on our client -- our interest on funds health for clients at this point that's what we think is more likely scenario, hopefully, we don't end up in a scenario where it goes the other way but we tend to doubt that that's what's going to happen. Unidentified Analyst : I know you've been asked a bit about some of the sort of Silicon Valley start-up competitive dynamic already, and in previous calls you've been asked more pointedly about square, and I think just going there and well-known name, it comes up a lot in discussions; is that something that you're seeing more or hearing about more, is it still kind of a different market with respect to your kind of customer base and your targets and their true kind of micro merchant addressable market? Martin Mucci : Well, I think Matt, some of the market is the same but we have not seen or heard much from that. They have like they announced, getting into the payroll was more a payroll mobile app but it was only for employers, for example, and I think it's still that way. There is not an employee mobile approximately, and that was -- and frankly, something like that. So it got a lot of press, I think that's as far as they went or at least the last that we've seen. And the employee piece is really the biggest piece of the mobile app and we feel like we have a very competitive mobile app with a 5-star kind of rating at this point, so we're feeling very good that that's very competitive and we have not seen any takeaways or any real feedback of people leaving to go to square. I think it rounds out their product set from the credit card processing standpoint but we have not seen it as someone who's going to go there necessarily for payroll in a mobile payroll approximately, that's only for the employer. Unidentified Analyst : So, probably hunting more within their own existing merchant client base as opposed to the greenfield opportunities out there more broadly where you're a lot more established? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think so. And that plus, I think anyone who would look at that, even though you may have your processing through them, I think if anybody was really looking for an app that provided a full feature employer and employee access and gave the full features of retirement and payroll and HR administration along the app, I don't think there be any comparison. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin [ph] of Citibank. Unidentified Analyst : I wanted to kind of get into your statement on introducing the discussion on EBITDA margins, as well as saying that you're now thinking of the business more on the EBITDA basis; is that a comment on future capital allocation, user cash, and should we sort of maybe combining that with the comment on low PEO penetration implies more Oasis type deals; how should I think of that? Martin Mucci : I think to some degree as Efrain mentioned and he mentioned in his comments, that does make some sense to the fact that amortizations and so forth, we want to make sure that it's very clear where the margins really are because of the PEO business, and sometimes the impact on operating margins versus the margins from an acquisition type standpoint; so I think you're certainly right on that and Efrain I think mentioned that. But on a go-forward basis, we're certainly looking very much at organic growth and combining the strength, here we bought the largest private PEO in the business and we feel like that integration is going very well, and so will we continue -- part of Oasis's plans were to continue roll-ups of other PEOs to add more strength to their offerings and we'll look at continuing to do that, will it be the size of Oasis, not really because there is no one out there of that size but I think that their strategy of rolling up and was part of ours as well will probably continue. Unidentified Analyst : And just switching gears a bit; as your existing client employees sort of go through the current tax filing process and tax season; are you beginning to maybe see a change in withholding? Is it potentially maybe surprised with their returns and so on or is it too early to tell? Any comment on future withholding patterns? Martin Mucci : I think we haven't really seen it yet. I think it might be a little bit too early until the filing date of April even though people file early. I think they are -- you do get anecdotal evidence that certainly people are looking at it, and asking a lot of questions of their tax preparers like how do I avoid this next time, and so probably we would expect to see withholdings go up a little bit, and therefore, probably the cash balances up a little bit but it would -- it's a little bit early to see that just yet. Unidentified Analyst : And last question. It's been asked a couple of different ways, the digital option that you spoke about -- and you mentioned that you might be seeing demand for this in other parts of your tech stack; can you talk about how you're thinking of the level of future tech investment, as well as whether this makes you rethink your -- sort of your conditional sales force process? Martin Mucci : Well, I think you're talking more of the e-commerce but I mean, overall we're always looking -- as Efrain said, like even the sales -- while the sales process has definitely been changing, and I feel like we've been changing and to some degree a few years ago catching up, now I feel like we're in pretty good shape with the lead and demand-gen investment that we used from some of the tax reform money in the last year to 18 months. We really have found how to capture much more data on clients even searching for Paychex, how to get more of those leads, and also how to deal with leads that are not -- that need to be nurtured as we would say; so that aren't ready to buy yet but you don't just lose those, you put them in a process where they're nurtured, and I'm sure you're aware of this -- with papers -- white papers on HR and you build the credibility of Paychex, so when they are ready to buy they're right there. So the increase in the way we've handled this from a digital process and a much more defined data analytics is much stronger than ever, we've been very good on the data analytics for using our client data that say when someone might have an issue or might be ready to leave us or something like that but this lead generation has gotten a lot tighter. And then, the next-generation, the further generation of that is this e-commerce platform, it's sure right now which -- we also found that the leads maybe great, we may be able to get a hold of a lot more prospects but it's hard -- but we may get a lot more prospects but it's really hard to reach them. And so e-commerce allows them to come in, decide, and select and start going down the process, and that is a much more powerful tool probably than we even expected as far as capturing new leads. So we're constantly looking at this, the data collection and data analytics is becoming such a bigger part of the service model and the sales model, and I feel like we've got the right people on it and the right tools in place. Unidentified Analyst : And there was a part of that question on the absolute level of tax spent? Martin Mucci : I think we're at a pretty good percentage of revenue and we kind of stick to that. I think we had obviously an enhancement to that last year but we feel like we can get back to a pretty levelized [ph] -- level of tax spending and we're doing pretty good with that. We've also find ways to be more productive in the tech side as well, and what our spend is by how we're doing some of that. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of David Grossman of Stifel. David Grossman : First, can we -- if you look at organic PEO growth and fiscal '19; can you help to segregate the -- kind of WSE growth versus insurance and any other pricing dynamics that maybe impacting growth? Martin Mucci : When you say impacting growth, what do you mean David? I'm not sure. David Grossman : Well, I'm just trying to just segregate I think [indiscernible]. Martin Mucci : So we've seen teens growth in revenue, I called out on the script where we are in terms of PEO and insurance growth. When you look at the PEO again growing in the teens, worksite employees growing in the teens; some quarters we've been a little bit above, some quarters a little bit below but you're getting the contributions coming from the fact that you're getting good worksite employee growth, not necessarily because of pricing or add-ons from past-throughs; so I'd say that. When you do segregate a little bit of the change in the growth rate that I called out, it really is a function of the fact that the insurance portion of PEO and insurance is growing more slowly than the PEO. And then we've got this drag that really is more of a second half of the year event that will persist into next year, and it could change -- markets change. But if you look at the underlying PEO, we expect it to grow in the teens and we would expect our worksite employee growth to grow comparable, that's excluding Oasis. Including Oasis the growth rate comes down a little bit just simply because it's a larger business, you -- the law of large numbers starts to take place, and we expect to get a combination of both, worksite employee growth and new client growth to drive that, the growth that's embedded in the outlook that we gave. David Grossman : And just following up in terms of the composition of the PEO; I mean obviously two significant acquisitions in the last 1.5 year or 2 years, can you give us just the sense of what that PEO looks like today excluding the ASO? For example, I know you report a combined WSE number, can you give us a sense for what the PEO is excluding the ASO? What your mix is between white, blue and grey [ph], and which are at-risk -- kind of percentage of insurance business? Efrain Rivera : So, the first thing is look, our client base is blue-grey or grey-blue, less white and more grey-blue; and obviously, we want the composition of that base to moderate more grey overtime than simply blue. So we'll look at that, that has a lot of implications as you know because you know the industry very well in terms of rates of healthcare attachment and workers comp rates but we feel we're in a good place there. If you look at where we are from a worksite employee perspective, having disclosed it but if you look at number 1 and you know what that number is, and you know where number 3 is, we're number 2 right in the middle of the two; so that will give you a sense of where we are from a worksite employee standpoint. And so we think in that space that Oasis has and I'll come back to something Marty said earlier, in that space that the combination of the Paychex PEO and also HROA [ph] and Oasis occupied, there is a lot of opportunity there, and right now our at-risk insurance and others non-guaranteed cost insurance is primarily limited to the Florida market. And everything else that -- so the only thing that we are reporting as pass-through revenues is the minimum premium revenues largely, the minimum premium revenues that we're collecting in Florida which is a percentage, it's not half of the percent of what we sell on health insurance, it's pretty -- it's a pretty carefully controlled amount of risk that we're taking. So if you look at everyone else in the industry, we occupy a middle ground between the position that the largest competitor takes which is all currently guaranteed costs, and others that are all at-risk; we carefully control the amount of that risk insurance that we have. David Grossman : And then just finally, in the spirit of abusing that time limit here; workers comp comment, you know, I -- because of the blue-grey composition; why isn't that the workers comp dynamic in the insurance side of your business isn't impacting the PEO business as well? I would think more favorably [indiscernible] what's going on. Efrain Rivera : In the PEO because you've got a bundle, you can offset the pieces of the of bundle that you're selling, so in a steady state you would have some impact but the reality is you're balancing that between the amount of healthcare insurance you're selling and the amount of workers comp that's attaching, and also the amount of admin fees you're charging. Our PEO is a little bit different probably than anyone else in the industry; when we underwrite a PEO customer, we do -- we make a determination; do we want you in our risk pool because if we don't want you in our risk pool, we're going to send you to our insurance agency and you're going to get priced that way. So we've got a little bit more control on the PEO side and through the extent that we don't like to risk, we basically offset -- we offload the risk to specialized carriers that don't mind dealing with that level of risk. So the net of what I just said is; it really doesn't have much of an impact on the on the PEO side. Operator : Thank you. I will now return the call to Martin Mucci for any additional or closing remarks. Martin Mucci : Great. Thank you. At this point we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for about 30 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our third quarter press release conference call, and for your interest in Paychex. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]  It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer to begin. Martin Mucci : Great, thank you and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex fourth quarter fiscal 2019 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended May 31, 2019. You can access our earnings release on the Investor Relations webpage. Our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July and this teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month. On today's call, I will review business highlights for the fourth quarter. Efrain will review our financial results for both the fourth quarter and full year and discuss our guidance for the upcoming fiscal 2020 and then we'll open it up for your questions. We closed fiscal 2019 with growth across our major product lines and solid progress toward our objectives. Our total revenue growth was 16% for the fourth quarter, which includes, of course, the incremental results from Oasis Outsourcing Group. Management Solutions revenue grew 4%, while PEO and Insurance Services revenues grew 67% or 10%, excluding the impact of Oasis.  As we look back on fiscal \u201819, we had a solid service and retention performance, a number of innovative enhancements to our product offerings and mobile app and we completed the largest acquisition in our history. The acquisition of Oasis added scale to our PEO business, and we ended the fiscal year, serving 1.5 million work site employees across all of our HR outsourcing services. In addition, we are beginning to realize the strategic benefits of the acquisition through the expansion of relationships with insurance partners and opportunities to upsell within the existing Oasis base. Our newly combined PEO leadership team continues to expand our leadership position in the HR outsourcing industry.  Fiscal 2019 reflected excellent execution in client service and operations, as seen in our client retention and our client satisfaction scores. Our client retention has continued to increase from the prior year, and we ended the fiscal year with payroll client retention on par with our historic best. We have made significant investments in our salesforce this year, particularly in our [insight] [ph] sales and mid market sales forces and in demand generation. These incremental investments are having an impact, as we have experienced increased sales momentum with these efforts. In addition, we have continued to produce solid new sales growth from our SurePayroll, HR solutions, retirement and PEO sales teams. The momentum in new sales coupled with improved client retention has resulted in overall growth in our payroll client base. As of May 31, 2019, we serve approximately 670,000 payroll clients.  In addition, excluding work site employees acquired as part of the Oasis acquisition, the number of work site employees served by our HR outsourcing services reflected double digit growth. America\u2019s businesses are operating in challenging times. The unemployment rate is at its lowest in nearly 50 years, while employers try to ramp up their hiring. As a result, there is a lack of talent to fill open jobs and the regulatory environment is complicated and continuously changing.  State jurisdictions are continuing to advance employment related laws and regulations that impact the hiring and employment of workers. Also, the way people work is changing, requiring employers to understand employees\u2019 workplace expectations, challenges and requirements. In this evolving landscape, businesses are looking for simple solutions that help them build their business, stay compliant, improve productivity and recruit, hire and retain talent.  Paychex is uniquely positioned to meet these needs through our breadth of service offerings, but more importantly, through the combination of our innovative technology, and personalized service model. This sets us apart and allows us to be true partners and advocates for our clients. We renewed our commitment to reducing the complexity for our customers related to payroll benefits and HR administration when we launched our new branding earlier this year. Our tagline, the power of simplicity, reinforces this commitment. We continually invest in our solutions to make payroll and HR administration simpler for our clients and their employees and provide solutions the way they are working today. 70% of the usage of our five star mobile app is done by our clients\u2019 employees. We are making it easier for the employees and more productive for our clients through an increased number of self service options.  The enhancements we have made throughout this past year include the HR centre with performance and learning management and enhanced HR data analytics, benefits management enhancements with a refreshed enrollment experience for health and benefits and retirement and increased options through the use of chatbots and artificial intelligence. All of these enhancements are designed to provide simple solutions for our clients and their employees. This focus on steadily investing in the innovation of our Paychex Flex human capital management technology played a significant part in our recognition by NelsonHall as a leader in payroll outsourcing for the North American small business market. This was our third year in a row receiving this designation. Shifting to other solutions, we currently face a retirement crisis in the US. A recent report from the US Federal Reserve found that a quarter of Americans have no retirement savings. We recently launched enhancements to our 401(k) product design to help address this crisis by simplifying retirement plan enrollment and management. These enhancements included a new participant dashboard and added functionality in the advisor portal. The new participant dashboard makes the process of enrolling in a 401(k) simpler than ever, and also provides a unique combination of tools and resources to empower participants in preparing for the retirement. Our mobile app allows a new participant to enroll in as few as four clicks, which has already resulted in increased participation rates.  We also continued to return value to our shareholders. In May, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend of $0.06 or 11% to $0.62 per share. During fiscal \u201919, we returned almost $900 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.  In summary, our fourth quarter caps another successful year for Paychex. Our state-of-the-art technology, full suite of HCM product offerings, and world class personalized service is a powerful combination that positions us for sustainable growth within our market ecosystem. Our organic business combined with our new acquisitions have positioned us well for fiscal 2020 and beyond. The sustained efforts of our employees and their commitment to our clients continue to drive the company forward. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Marty and good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and as such involve some risks. Please refer to our earnings release for the customary disclosures. In addition, I'll periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These measurements exclude certain discrete tax items and one-time charges. Please refer to our press release and investor presentation for a discussion of these measures and a reconciliation for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2019 to their related GAAP measures. I\u2019ll start by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter and then follow up with some greater detail in certain areas. I'll touch briefly on full year results and wrap with a review of the fiscal 2020 outlook. Total revenue and service revenue, both grew 16% for the fourth quarter to 980 million compared to 958, I'm sorry, and 958 million respectively. Excluding Oasis service revenue, total revenue both grew by 5%.  Expenses increased 22% for the fourth quarter to 666 million, but if you exclude the Oasis acquisition, expense growth was 6%. The increase in total expenses excluding Oasis is primarily driven by increased headcount due to incremental investments in the salesforce, technology resources and operations to support the growth in business. In addition, an increase in PEO insurance costs contributed approximately 1% to the growth in total expenses in the fourth quarter.  Operating income increased 4% to 314 million. Operating margin was 32.1% for the fourth quarter compared to 35.7% for the same period last year. Margins were impacted by business mix, but -- due to the growth in the PEO business, accelerated investments in sales, technology and operations as well as some one-time acquisition, integration and amortization costs associated with the Oasis acquisition. Our effective income tax was 25.8% for the fourth quarter compared to 28.5% for the same period last year. Net income increased 6% to 230 million and adjusted net income increased 10% to 228 million for the fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share increased 7% to $0.64 for the fourth quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $0.63. I\u2019ll now provide some additional color in selected areas, management solutions revenue. As you know, this includes our payroll service revenue together with other HCM products included in many of our product bundles. It increased 4% to 695 million for the fourth quarter. The increase was primarily driven by growth in our client base across many of our services, along with growth in payroll revenue, and payroll revenue per check, which increased or improved as a result of increases, net of discounts.  Within management solutions revenue, retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in the number of plans served as well as an increase in revenue earned on the asset value participants, 401(k) funds, PEO and insurances revenue, it increased 67% as Marty mentioned to 263 million for the fourth quarter. Excluding the acquisition of Oasis, PEO and Insurance Services revenue increased approximately 10% for the quarter. The increase was driven by growth in clients and client work site employees across our combined PBS and HROI PEO businesses.  Demand for our existing PEO services along with growth within our client base resulted in double digit growth in the number of client work site employees served. Insurance service revenue benefited from an increase in the number of health and benefit clients and applicants, partially offset by the impact of softness in the workers\u2019 comp market as we discussed last quarter. Interest on funds held for clients increased 25% for the fourth quarter to from 25, I'm sorry, 25% to 22 million, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates earned. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients remained flat for the fourth quarter as the impact of lower client withholdings resulting from tax reform legislation and changes in client mix were partially offset by the impact of wage inflation. Interest expense, net, I\u2019ll note that we had a net non operating interest expense compared to net investment income in the prior year. This is a result of interest expense of the $800 million of debt financing that we utilized to fund a portion of the Oasis purchase price. The $800 million is made up of private placement debt securities with terms of seven or 10 years with coupon rates of 4.07% to 4.25% respectively.  Now, let me touch on year-to-date results quickly. Management solutions revenue, again up 4% to 2.9 billion; PEO and Insurance Services revenue increased 48% to 822 million, 19%, excluding Oasis. Interest on funds held for clients, up 27% to 81 million, driven by interest rate increases and partially offset by impact of decline in average invested balances. Total revenues increased 12% to 3.8 billion, 7% growth excluding Oasis.  Operating margins were 36.3%, tempered by investments in the business, the acquisition of Oasis and growth in the existing PEO direct insurance costs. Net income increased 4% and adjusted net income increased 11%. Diluted EPS increased 4% and adjusted diluted EPS also increased 11%.  Turning to our investment portfolio, as you know, our goal is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. Our long term portfolio has an average yield of 2.1% and average duration of 2.9 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 2.1% and 1.9% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year respectively. These are up from 1.7% and 1.5% for the respective periods last year. Let's talk about our financial position. It remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of almost $800 million as of May 31, 2019. Funds held for clients were, as of May 31, 2019, were 3.8 billion compared to 4.7 billion as of May 31, 2018. As you know, funds held for clients vary widely on a day to day basis, and averaged 4.1 billion for the fourth quarter and 4 billion for the fiscal year. Our total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients, reflected net unrealized gains of 20 million as of May 31, 2019 compared with net unrealized losses of 38 million as of May 31, 2018. The move to a net gain position was due to declines in longer term yields. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was 2.6 billion as of the end of the year, reflecting 827 million in dividends paid and $57 million worth of shares repurchased during 2019. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a very robust 42%.  Cash flows from operations were 1.3 billion for the fiscal year, an increase of 1% from the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher net income and non-cash adjustments, partially offset by fluctuations in working capital. Working capital fluctuations related to timing around collections and related tax payments for our combined PEO business along with higher accounts receivables related to growth in our payroll funding business for temporary staffing clients.  Now, let's turn to the guidance. I remind you that our outlook is based upon current view of -- our current view of economic conditions continuing with no significant changes. Our management solutions revenue is anticipated to grow 4%. PEO and insurance revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of 30% to 35%, reflecting a full year of Oasis. Interest on funds held for clients is anticipated to grow in a range of 4% to 8%.  At this stage, we do not contemplate either any increases, obviously less likely and no rate declines. We will watch and see what happens. Total revenue is anticipated to grow in the range of 10% to 11%. Operating income, as a percent of total revenue is anticipated to be approximately 36%, comparable with this year, reflecting the expected impact of higher PEO direct insurance costs.  EBITDA margin for the fiscal year 2020 is expected to be approximately 41%, again, comparable to where we are -- where we end this year. Net interest expense is anticipated to be in the range of 15 million to 18 million, reflecting a full year of interest on outstanding long term debt, which I discussed previously. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2020 is expected to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%. Net income and diluted earnings per share are both anticipated to grow approximately 8% and adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are both expected to increase in the range of 8% to 9%. And remember that we don't plan on necessarily the benefit of -- tax benefit when we get stock comp exercise, which is why we adjusted out. I will provide further color on the gating. Management solutions revenue quarterly gating is anticipated to be consistent with the full year guidance, with the exception of the first quarter, which is anticipated to be in the range of 3% to 4%, largely due to a mix of days in the quarter. However, please note that growth rates for the PEO and insurance revenues are anticipated to be significantly higher in the first half of the fiscal year, until we reach the anniversary of the Oasis acquisition.  So, we anticipate growth in the range of 60% to 65% in the first half of fiscal 2020 and then growth of 11% to 14% in the second half. So, let me just repeat that. We anticipate growth in the range of 60% to 65% in the first half of fiscal 2020 for PEO and Insurance Services and then growth moderates to 11% to 14% in the second half, as we anniversary the Oasis acquisition.  Our net income gating is also impacted by the timing of the Oasis acquisition together with related amortization expense and integration costs. This causes lower net income growth in the first half of the fiscal year. In addition, incremental investments in sales, technology and operations are ramped over the year during fiscal 2019. We expect net income growth to be below the full year guidance range provided at approximately 3% for the first half of the fiscal year. And then we expect it to increase to a range of 11% to 13% in the second half of the year. So, let me repeat that. We expect net income growth to be below the full year guidance range for the first half of the year, and we expect it to be approximately 3% for the first half of the fiscal year and then we expect it to increase to a range of 11% to 13% for the second half of the year, due to the factors described above.  Then, one final point on -- specific to Q1, for the first quarter fiscal 2020, net income growth is anticipated to be in the range of 1% to 2%, with the most significant driver being that of investment spending, funded by tax reform that was just starting to ramp up during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and incremental expenses from Oasis. So with that, and with that color on the guidance, I will, one, refer you to our investor slides for more detail that have been posted on the web and I will now turn the pull back to Marty. Martin Mucci : Thank you, Efrain . Operator, we\u2019ll now open up the call for any questions please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask again, about just your operating margin guidance. You took it down a little bit and of course, you called out higher PEO direct insurance costs. Can you again just sort of remind us of the drivers of those higher costs? And also, are there any other secondary factors or headwinds. There was quite a bit of content in your remarks and just kind of parse out for us exactly what's happening in terms of your expectations for guidance for margins in this coming year? Efrain Rivera : Hey, Ramsey, the first thing I'd say is that it wasn't a change from what we said before. We said that operating, when you go back to Q3, and we said it would be consistent with this year, which was 36%. That's what we called out this year. So I would say that, with respect to your question on the margins, what we're seeing is that we, by having more PEO revenue in the mix, it has a moderating impact on margins and it's offset by other efficiencies in the business, which is why even though our PEO revenues are up as a percentage of total revenues for the year, you see that the impact actually year-over-year is not significant.  The other thing I would point you to is that in Q3, we said that our EBITDA margin would be comparable to our operating margin. And that's exactly what we just stated. So I think it's consistent with what we said before. Ramsey El-Assal: Fair enough. I wanted to ask you a broader kind of industry question about the PEO market in terms of further consolidation, just in terms of the industry, do you expect this market to kind of continue to consolidate, you\u2019ve got another couple of good sized players out there, probably a lot of smaller regional players as well, how do you see the market landscape changing?  And then just a quick final bolt-on is, what interest rate assumptions are you using for your fluid income growth guidance. And with that, I can hop back in the queue. Martin Mucci : Okay. Ramsey, I'll take the PEO one. I think you will see some further consolidation. I think as it becomes more competitive, you need to have the breadth of services and the relationships with the carriers to offer the best, both combination of product and service, the best technology from a mobile standpoint as well, for the enrollment of the benefits. And you got to have the experience to handle some of the pretty rapidly changing requirements from the state side and from the carriers on what the new insurance plans are, what the new rules are, and the HR piece of it is becoming even more important many times than the benefits themselves.  So I think smaller players will find it, continue, will continue to find it difficult to provide and compete in this environment. And certainly with our acquisition of Oasis, there's been a lot -- even more interest, I think, in the consolidation and the growth in that market, which continues to grow very strong across the board. I think as I noted and Efrain mentioned I think as well, our growth in work site employees was double digits, even without the Oasis acquisition. So we're very proud of the sales and the service that we're providing in the PEO market. And I'll turn it back to Efrain on the interest rate assumptions. Efrain Rivera : Yeah, so Ramsey, in my comments, I mentioned in the fourth quarter, our combined portfolios were 2.1%. You can see for the year, we were 1.9% for the full year, so I would expect that, when you look at the full year impact, we're going to tick up slightly from where we are in fourth quarter, we'll have a little bit of benefit from balances that should be a bit higher than what we had this year. But it's modest. You can see in the guidance, a 4% to 8% increase on interest on funds held for clients, we're being somewhat cautious on what we expect in terms of the portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Jim Schneider : I may have missed the exact client count growth, you used to call it out in your prepared remarks, can you maybe talk about, within segments, small, micro, small and mid market kind of where you [Technical Difficulty] Martin Mucci : I think it's either on, I think it's on \u2013 in the press release, and it's on our investors slide. So we ended the year at about 670,000 clients. Last year, we disclosed 650. We saw growth or -- we saw a lot of growth in the SMB segment of the market. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : I just want to start with a question on core payroll revenue growth and thank you for the final quarter disclosure on that metric. I think it did slow to a point down to 2% in Q4 and came in I guess 2% rounded for the full year. Was that effectively all pricing? And then would you expect to get a similar amount of pricing in fiscal \u201820? Efrain Rivera : Jason, I don't think it slowed. I think what you're seeing is that we anniversaried the acquisition of Lessor last year. So Q3 was a tick higher and it is very difficult, I would caution to compare Q3 to Q4 now, because Q3 has certain kinds of revenue that only recur -- only occur in that quarter. So, I think we ended up, we were pleased with where we ended up, we had client growth, we certainly saw some really robust results in parts of the market. Our internal sales were very good. SurePayroll had a really strong year and we are positioned really well from a digital marketing standpoint and from an internal sales standpoint. So I feel really good about where we're exiting the year. And obviously, we had client growth, which is the ultimate indicator of that. Jason Kupferberg : And just anything on the pricing? Efrain Rivera : Look, pricing is a part of -- is a part of the equation. So, we would expect certainly that we can continue to get price and never had an issue. Martin Mucci : Yeah, we've had, especially when you think about the client retention at historic highs, we think the pricing has stocked very well. And we've been able to sell the value of not only the technologies and that we've been introducing in the mobile app and so forth, but the service as well. So I think, still having the pricing in the same range we've been in the past, it should absolutely be doable, and we should be able to retain and hold that pricing as well. Jason Kupferberg : And I just wanted to make sure I heard the comments properly around the fluid income forecast. I think you indicated you're not assuming any changes in fed funds. I mean, obviously the market is pricing in a high probability of that next month. So I just wanted to make sure that you still got the rule of thumb right on that, if I recall, a 25 basis point change in fed funds is roughly a percent or so of net income, does that still hold? Efrain Rivera : 25 bps, no, it's not correct. So, it's about a 25 bp drop would results between in a impact of about 3 million to 4 million. So, I haven't done the, maybe that equates to 1%, but I would caution a little bit about that because one of the things that we looked at when we looked at the guidance was, we have ways to adjust the duration of the portfolio to deal with changes and modest changes or declines during the year. So I wouldn't necessarily take that to the bank, because we do have some things we can do, if we see some modest decreases during the year. And that's why we are conservative on the range we've provided. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. And then just last one, kind of on the macro front. I know you guys obviously have no client concentration, but just wanted to see if we can get an update on which parts of the economy these days you're most exposed to, construction, manufacturing, service industries, restaurants, whatever it may be, just as people contemplate where the US economy may be heading in the next 12 to 18 months, how we should be thinking about Paychex\u2019s exposures? Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think, we're pretty well spread across all of the different sectors. And I don't think we're seeing any big change in any of those. On our small business index that we put out for clients under 50, we're seeing kind of all sectors kind of hanging in there at the same, manufacturing has been down, but it's about the same. And I would say still the strongest from an index perspective is those other services, discretionary services, and those type of things that were pretty heavy in.  And so I would think that they're still doing pretty well. And, they're still -- they're not necessarily growing, but they're growing, but they're growing at a slower rate than they have in the past. But they're still growing. And I think the thing would be to watch some of the minimum wage increases, and has that done anything. We haven't seen a big impact from those at this point. And instead, we're seeing sometimes more hours worked in general for those jobs. So I would say we're pretty spread out and we don't see any major concern at this point, we're not seeing any signs of necessarily a slowdown, still growth, little slower growth than in the past, but that was some of the recovery as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Berkley of Wolfe Research. James Berkley : Just wondering what you guys are seeing for bookings on the PEO side, you\u2019re still trending low double digit to low teens like you were last quarter, any change in cadence there. And could you walk us through the workers\u2019 comp and the way it impacts you going forward and just how you're thinking about that in the quarters ahead. Martin Mucci : I would say on the PEO side, both existing client growth, and work site employees, and the new sales have been very strong. As I mentioned, we're double digit without the Oasis acquisition and of course, with that even stronger in the double digit side. So, we're showing very good strength in work site employees. We now across PEO ASO, all of our products, we serve more work site employees than anyone else. And we're showing great solid growth there. As I mentioned, the need for HR and the benefits is so much -- so significant these days with the unemployment rate so low, particularly for small and mid-sized businesses, if they're going to attract and retain people, they really need the benefit of good benefits plans and good HR, which includes training and developing their people, data analytics, all the things that we're providing now, learning management systems that give them free training modules that they can use or develop their own.  So I think we're going to see continued good strong growth in the PEO side, in particular, and of course, our ASO side as well, if they don't necessarily want the PEO or don't qualify under underwriting. We take them through the insurance agency, of which we\u2019re the 20th largest in the country. And that gives us a great out that even many other PEO competitors do not have in their favor. Would you want to talk about workers\u2019 comp? Efrain Rivera : Yeah, so just to add some color on that James, two of the strongest quarters from a bookings perspective in the entire company were PEO, which was very strong and then mid market, which was very strong too. So we had two parts of business that had very, very strong growth from a bookings perspective. On the workers\u2019 comp side, it was, as we called it, a soft quarter. We think that's going to persist for at least two or three quarters that's built into our guidance. Rates have softened pretty significantly. It tempers the growth of PEO. You can't see it as much because our PEO growth in the fourth quarter organically was in the upper teens. And so it's tempered a bit by the cyclical nature of the workers\u2019 comp market, which currently is soft, but we will see where we end up at the beginning of next year. So there's a couple of things that mask what is very, very strong performance on the PEO side and we were very heartened also by strong performance in mid market HCM. James Berkley : That's good to hear. Just two more quick things I wanted to touch on. Something that you guys mentioned, you talked about SurePayroll briefly, just saying, you had a great year there and you expect them to do well going forward I think. Can you just expand on that a little bit? And then secondly, the duration comment you made, I think your portfolio is around like 3.1 years or so, like, what can you bring that to? And how would that impact the 3 million to 4 million you referenced? Just a little more color on how we should think about that. Martin Mucci : Yeah, I'll lead with the SurePayroll. Yeah, I think, we have really mastered the [indiscernible] demand generation, we've put a lot of investment in that from both SurePayroll and Flex and Paychex Flex. And I think we've really done a great job as far as the investments in improving demand generation and nurturing, meaning including nurturing leads, that were weaker leads in the past that we may have lost because we didn't -- they didn't -- weren't ready to buy it. But we've got a quite complex nurturing process now where we can reach out and continue to build the leads, and get them when they're ready.  SurePayroll, I think has been, not only priced effectively, but also through the demand generation, getting a lot more leads and been able to close them and also allowing some self service options. So allowing clients to kind of onboard themselves if they wish, which was a lot more self service options that prospects want now. They can go in, they can start. If they need help, we\u2019ll jump in and help them. But that whole self service part of it is also another way of capturing a lead that was looking to get started right away and may have been difficult to reach if we call them back.  So the whole change, the number of changes we've made in demand generation and handling telephonic sales, both here at Paychex and through SurePayroll have been very strong and we expect that growth to continue. I think the product, the service and the positioning of how we sell online and telephonically has become much stronger this year.  Efrain, you want to take the\u2026? Efrain Rivera : Yeah, so, yeah, you're right, James. So the duration of the portfolio is in the low 3s. We could stretch that up to about 3.75 years of duration if we wanted to. We're obviously playing a number of those different variables across different scenarios. So that's why, I think in response to Jason's question, actually, maybe Ramsey, and Jason\u2019s question, what we feel comfortable with is by setting the range where we are, we will just see where the fed ends up from a rate cut perspective and then we can adjust the portfolio accordingly to not have a major impact. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Keane of Deutsche Bank. Brian Keane : Just a couple of clarifications, on the payroll client growth of 3%, was that in line with expectations and how is that tracking historically? And should we just kind of model that same amount of growth going forward? Efrain Rivera : Every year is a little bit different, Brian. So, I would say that what we say is that expect payroll client growth to be in the 1% to 3% range. Last year, we didn't hit that target. This year, we were solidly within that. I would say that going forward, we expect to be within that range. Brian Keane : And then thinking about the PEO insurance revenue growth, I know in the back half, we're talking about 11% to 14% growth. I'm guessing the fourth quarter will be the strongest quarter, though as some of the worker comp issues lap and then kind of growth rate should be a more normalized growth rate there once we get through the worker comp issue. Efrain Rivera : I am going to hold off talking about it specifically, because there's, by the time we get to Q4, there'll be lots of specific issues that are going to affect -- could affect that growth number. So I hope, but I think what we're comfortable with is saying where we are at the second half, we\u2019ll update as we go through the year. Brian Keane : But the drag, primarily the drag out there in kind of the second half, is that workers\u2019 comp growth rate or just any other puts and takes? I know, the business obviously outperformed, growing 18, I think it was 18 to 20 was the guide for fiscal year \u201819 originally, and then. And now that's a little bit of a lower growth rate, ex that, so just trying to make the delta change. Efrain Rivera : So I get where you're going, but I guess Brian, what I'd say is that we should have anniversaried a lot of the impacts by fourth quarter, but I have no idea of what the growth rate and the existing growth rate we\u2019ll be in at that point in market growth rate I should say, not ours, I know exactly what ours is. So I can\u2019t call that specifically. I think the fourth quarter will depend in large measure on how strong we exit the year, next year with PEO, with Oasis in the fold. So I think it's going to depend on that and also where we are with the workers\u2019 comp market. So they're still miles and miles to go before we get to Q4 of next year. But those will be the factors that will drive Q4 growth. Brian Keane : [Technical Difficulty] continues to move and improve, how much room is there still to go that you can improve client retention? Martin Mucci : Hi, Brian. You cut out just at the very beginning of that. Could you just say that again? Brian Keane : Yeah, just was asking about client retention. That seems like it's continued to improve and move the right direction, just trying to figure out how much more room is there for that improve as you guys go forward here? Martin Mucci : Okay. Yeah, I think we're very pleased with what we've done. We're at historic highs. So we'll always try to make that a little bit stronger. I think we're finding ways to service clients differently now, as they want to be serviced a little bit differently. It's not all -- it's probably half of them that want that necessarily telephonic payroll, dedicated payroll specialist, so many more are calling in, so many more are using the app, the chatbots and that we're doing for self service.  So, it's putting us in a place that we haven't been before, that could drive a little bit of more improvement. But given the number of losses in small business, which is still a large majority of the clients, I'd have to say, I'd like to say, I do see some improvement, but it probably has some top level, it can get to when you just have a large number, half of them or more, a little bit more than that are just out of business. So it'll depend a little bit on, obviously, the economy as well. But those leaving for service, price and those things, I think and still get a little bit more of improvement out of it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Jeff Silber : Just had a couple of modeling related questions, I know you typically don't guide to free cash flow. Is there anything going on differently next year or should we just kind of assume this typical conversion rate from EBITDA? Efrain Rivera : I think it's probably typical, Jeff. We also gave, I think, in the investor slides, we give you an update on the D&A for next year versus this year. So, you can calculate the incremental amount. I know you're big on those two numbers. So as and, they're important, so they're in the slides there. But, there should be no significant changes in terms of conversion. Jeff Silber : You caught me on that, Efrain. Thanks. Efrain Rivera : You caught me so. Jeff Silber : And then also just a minor one, you gave us some color on the cadence quarterly? I do appreciate that. Is there any specific impact from a margin perspective quarterly and also from a tax perspective quarterly? Efrain Rivera : Well, I mean, from a net perspective, there's some impact. When you work through the model of what I said, where the first half is 3%, and I called out Q1, 1% to 2%, and then in the back half, so from a net perspective, obviously, in the back half, what you're seeing is higher margins. But part of it is too that, partly due to ASC 606, we have more -- we're more heavily back half weighted than we used to be before. And so if you look at our expenses, and you assume that there's not big changes quarter over quarter in our expenses, what you see is that the flow through of the incremental revenue drives higher income in the back half of the year. That's what you're seeing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Marty, I wanted to ask a little bit about the PEO business. I know, Oasis, you talked about investment both in sales and technology. And I'm wondering, what kind of growth you are anticipating next year for the Oasis sales force? And just from a technology standpoint, is that just that you're going to have a more robust mobile offering or are there other investments that you're making in the business? Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think Kartik, what you'll see and we've already been doing some of this is linking them to our products. So, Oasis already now is linked to our time and attendance products. They are linked better to our interfacing with our 401(k) in our retirement services product. These are things that that salesforce has not had before. They also have the opportunity to use our insurance agency, which they didn't have before. So if they didn't, if it is a PEO, if the underwriting didn't fit primarily, they couldn't necessarily take them for insurance, for the insurance products. And now they can run those through our insurance agency.  We're just kind of working through all of the sales teams, but we have all of the leadership team now in place for a number of months, for probably a quarter and they're working through combining all of the sales processes and compensation plans and directions. And so they'll have more products to offer. They'll have insurance, the insurance agencies to support them. And they'll certainly have all of the tools with salesforce and the level of technology that we use for our sales teams to track leads and referrals, et cetera. So, we're feeling that we're pretty solid coming into this fiscal year as we start this month with Oasis and our PEO teams really combined -- and underwriting as well, all kind of combined and streamlined, so that they're going to have a lot more to offer. Kartik Mehta : And then Marty, I think you talked about maybe changing of how you're obtaining clients in the sense that I don't know if you use this word or not, but inside sales, and has that, I guess how has over the last 6 to 12 months, changed as to how you're obtaining clients versus just sales force that knocks on doors versus somebody that's inside. Martin Mucci : Yeah, the inside sales or telephonic sales, from a Paychex standpoint, has continued to increase their production, their double digit growth over last year. We're also introducing, in trialing some self service and really through SurePayroll who has had that now for most of this year, now, you're seeing that, one, the leads come in, and they can either be addressed immediately by either the field or telephonically, depending kind of on the size and what they're looking for, if they're directly referred to by a CPA, who is tied to our field sales rep, we\u2019ll get them right to the field sales rep immediately. And they'll address it, if they'd rather just deal with something on the phone, do a demo over online, and then close on the sale right there and have it, implemented it, we\u2019ll do that. And now we're moving, you're going to see us moving toward a self service option as well that SurePayroll has, and has been working very effectively.  One of the biggest issues with telephonic sales and leads frankly coming in is that once you have the lead where someone's been interested, they fill out a form, you can't get back a hold of the prospect, because nobody answers their phone anymore. So, what we're doing is, we're -- by allowing self service where the client can actually get started and set themselves up, if they have an issue, then we can talk to them. But they've already started by almost completing the sale by starting to set up themselves, which they'd like to do immediately. So that has also really turned out very well for us and we're seeing a lot of good leads there for sure. The field is still very important to us, particularly from a channel development, we still continue to be a leader, I think in the CPA referral market, incurring client referrals. And that's done very strongly by the field. And they'll continue to concentrate on that. But as more of the small, the brand new businesses start up and they come in through the web, the deal is how fast can you handle them and they're certainly fine with handling it over the phone or setting it up themselves. Kartik Mehta : And then just one last question, Efrain, obviously the balance sheet, other acquisition opportunities that happen to come up, what's the comfort level in terms of leverage for the company today? Efrain Rivera : Well, right now, we end the year, we're at zero net debt. So, we certainly have the ability to get more leverage, be more levered if we want to. Yeah. I don't think there's a specific number, we're going to be conservative about it obviously, a turn and a half of EBITDA that starts to get a little bit higher than, a little bit higher in the range, would we go higher, it would really depend on whether we thought an acquisition was strategic or not. So I think it depends on the, it depends on the opportunity. Oasis, we used cash on hand, we borrowed $800 million. Oasis is going to be cash accretive. We have the capability of doing the right kind of targeted acquisitions to be more acquisitive and it will depend on, it will depend on whether, what\u2019s the size of the acquisition and how strategic the opportunity is. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Grossman of Stifel. David Grossman : Just wanted to go back to the growth of the PEO, but I guess I'm just having a little trouble following the math. So perhaps you can go back and reconcile the organic growth of the PEO in the fourth quarter, which I think you said was about 10%, with the high teens growth for the year, and then the guide of 11 to 14 in the back half of the year, next year, which presumably is an organic number when you lap the comparison. I know workers\u2019 comp is a little bit of that. So if you could just maybe deconstruct that for us. Efrain Rivera : So now, you started with a faulty premise, you said that PEO was 10%. PEO was not 10%. PEO and Insurance was 10% in the quarter. PEO, as I mentioned before, if we isolate it, was upper teens, number one. Work site growth, work site employee growth was again double digit, we didn't disclose an exact number. But you can see from the growth in work site employs that Marty cited, we're up to 1.5 million of work site employees serviced across our ASO and our PEO that we had nice growth. So, we had really good bookings growth organically on the PEO, the PEO at the end of the year organically was growing in the upper teens. And then in the back half of next year, we're calling up 11% to 14%, once we anniversary Oasis and what's going on there is that there's a drag from workers\u2019 comp that's impacting that number. So if there were no workers\u2019 comp, the number would be higher, based on where we anticipate things will be as we get to the third and fourth quarter of next year. So hopefully that \u2013 David Grossman : Right, so I'm sorry. So you are high teens PEO growth in the fourth quarter, and you are high teens for the year. Is that it? Efrain Rivera : I think it's called out either on one of the slides or in, I called it out in my comments. But our PEO growth for the year was 19%. David Grossman : Thank you for that clarification. Efrain Rivera : It's always important to remember that PEO and Insurance as the Paychex Insurance Agency, and we're battling a bit of a drag on the workers\u2019 comp side that we will battle into next year. But we're obviously showing some pretty good underlying growth. David Grossman : Right, right. And then just, there was a comment, I think, Marty, you made about the integration with the carriers, as it relates to Oasis. So perhaps you could just give us a little bit more color on kind of where you are in that process and how much incremental geographic reach you're getting as a result of that, as you try to convert the payroll installed base? Martin Mucci : Sure, David, there's really two pieces of that. Well, first of all, I think we're in good shape. We're in the middle of that now, but have been already working through it, and particularly the last few months. So one, there's geographic growth, because they were in some states and areas that we weren't. So, they had relationships there and already had some clients that we could gain referrals from. From the carriers, they were a stronger -- they were stronger with one particular carrier that we have not been quite as strong with that gave us a little bit more leverage when you put ours together. Now we have more strength and more clout with all the carriers that we\u2019re involved with. So we think we've got very good plans between the two of us, going forward into fiscal \u201820. And those were allowed kind of through the year. And so that gives us a better, also, when you have more, more clout, I guess or more clients, obviously, we\u2019ll have better integration with those carriers as well. So I think we're set up well with the number of carriers, the plans and the integration with them. So it's going to give us an expansion into a little more, a few more states that we're not in, but better than that, a little bit stronger carrier relations for the best benefit plans, which is one of the most important things to have as you go out and compete. David Grossman : Right. So as you look at kind of the geographic template with Oasis, do you think you've got pretty much solid coverage across the overlap with your installed base and payroll customers? Martin Mucci : Yeah, we certainly do, particularly, I wouldn't say it covers the whole map by any means, but it covers those states that particularly have an interest in PEO and I don\u2019t mean just the Georgia, Florida, Texas, California kind of thing, it's going into more states as we expand it, but it definitely picked up. I think they were in 14 different states, so we definitely picked up more states and where there is more interest in PEO, so it expanded where we were from that standpoint. And again, as I mentioned earlier, we're already integrating them with some of our products that they didn't have to offer as well. So not only do you get caught with the carriers and the benefit plans that they can offer, but also now they can more easily sell time and attendance that's integrated, 401(k) that's integrated, and they have our insurance agency to back them up if there's a client we don't want to underwrite. Efrain Rivera : Hey David, one other thing I would say, I want to make sure that it's not implicit in the assumption in your question, PEO is probably, is unique among the products that we sell in that a significant amount of the sales come from outside the Paychex client base. So if you take HROI and Oasis, you now have access to clients that are outside of the Paychex traditional base, client base. So our expectations about growth in PEO are not solely based on the upsell of existing Paychex clients. They're based on going out and getting new, brand new to Paychex clients and PEO. So, it's a mixture of both. So, and we talked geographic coverage, not just the base. It's also being in those geographies in a more concentrated way. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson. Lisa Ellis : Can you talk a little bit about the investment focus areas for 2020? I mean, you've had terrific success now with the digital marketing initiatives, sales initiatives, et cetera. You've got client base up, retention up. As you're looking out into 2020, what's the next wave of investment areas? Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think it continues to be in the innovation of the products and adding every -- about every six weeks, we're adding additional feature and functionality to the payroll products, and particularly the HR side of the business, whether it's learning management, whether it's a partnership with, let me stick with the product for a second, I want to go to partnership. But with the products like learning management, data analytics, I think you'll see also, we're continuing to invest in the chatbot and artificial intelligence that we're using. We're seeing that to be a big help from the service perspective, and also on the mobile app. So we're continuing to make things simple for clients and their employees.  70% of our mobile app usage is employees of our clients. And what we're finding is things like when we make it easy to enroll in 401(k), they can do it in four clicks now versus the paperwork and the passing of the paperwork to the client and to us and back and forth. That participant rate is already going up. And those who are signing up for the 401(k), that leads to better client retention, because they now pass all the compliance tests. And they have their employees that are happy with their retirement plans and gives them better retention.  So the investment will be to continue to make things simple from the mobile app side, from the client employee side, self service is going to be \u2013 it just continues to be very important, right from initially signing up, right through to setting up everything for yourself, there's a whole wave these days of clients and their employees wanting to do things themselves when they want to do it. So you've got to make everything simple. Luckily, our investments very long ago started to be, our development was mobile first, meaning everything is made, designed simple for the mobile app, and then can expand for your desktop, as you need it.  So a big thing there. Partnerships will be again, for, we have the only large partnership that's been announced with Indeed. We are out there, providing a connection directly to Flex with basically the push of a tile or a button that will get you to Indeed and help you post a job, critically important right now in this low unemployment area. These are partnerships that we haven't necessarily done before and we're being much more aggressive in trying to partner with what the needs of the client have been.  So, we're very pleased with the investments in artificial intelligence and chatbots. What that also, I didn't even mention, has done for service. Now we're taking, I mean, 60% of the service requests coming in on a chatbot are handled by that or coming in online are being handled by that chatbot. That's freeing up our personnel for much more complicated questions and for more clients that they can handle. So, it's really helping us from a service perspective as well. Lisa Ellis : Efrain, I have a, just my follow up, a sort of back to basics question on the PEO and ASO business, because you've mentioned a few times now, your insurance agency, can you just remind us when and what types of clients you will take on the underlying actuarial risk? And then I guess I thought that you reinsure that. So can you just clarify, sort of in what situations does the client end up entering the PEO versus end up using your insurance agency potentially? And like what differentiates those two and sort of how does it impact your economics? Efrain Rivera : Yeah, so just the 122nd flyover, on workers\u2019 comp, I'm going to say between 60% and 65% of all clients in PEO end up being underwritten by Paychex and then we set reserves and have reinsurance above certain levels, have been doing that for more than two decades without any issues. We look at that very, very closely. So then you say, well, what happens to the other third? Well, there's certain clients that you don't want to underwrite workers\u2019 comp or we have the unique advantage of having a insurance agency right next door. So we will place those clients with Paychex Insurance Agency. And one of the things that we found this year that was really a help was that by creating more of a tight linkage between the PEO and the insurance agency, it's now much more seamless to say to a client that otherwise we would not do workers\u2019 comp for, to simply refer them to the agency to see if they can get a policy place, that's been a big plus and a big hit with our sales force too. On the healthcare side, it's primarily a state of Florida issue, there's a little bit of other risk we take. And that's just a function of the concentration of clients that we have in Florida, we have an MPP plan, we do insurance with the blues of Florida that gives access to a much broader network or to a broader network of healthcare providers. And again, we look at the projected MLRs or medical loss ratios for the pool, we adjust reserves appropriately and above a certain amount, we reinsure that risk. So that's basically what we're doing, more limited risk taking on the healthcare side, we take some risk on workers\u2019 comp, reinsure it, and then are very strict about who we let into the pool in either case, and refer other clients. By the way, I said, workers\u2019 comp in terms of insurance referrals, we also refer for healthcare to our agency. So we've got flexibility and this helps us kind of protect the quality of the pool and workers\u2019 comp in healthcare. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Hey, so I know you mentioned a couple of times on the retention that you're bumping up against historical levels. So if you think about the investments you've made, kind of diversification into PEO, is it, what's the probability we enter a new range on that? And I guess, Marty, can you remind us kind of where we are, where that number is today? And if it is in fact the case, so we can kind of reset that range, what's a better way to think about that? And then just, what's the sensitivity to 100 basis points in terms of revenue? Martin Mucci : Yeah, I'll start with -- it's a little stronger than 82% on the client retention, the way we look at it. I think it's a little bit better than that from a revenue perspective, we don't typically give that but it's better than that. So our historic high has been right around that 82%. Now, when you think about, as I said Kevin earlier, when you think about losses for the small business side, it's pretty tough to get a lot better than that, because small businesses just start up and go out of business. And obviously, we've been able to handle that very effectively and profitably, but I think, we'll look through the investments that I just talked about, on Lisa's question, when you think about the investments in chatbots and artificial intelligence and responding to clients even quicker, is there something there not to mention, we've done a lot of investment in data analytics, and knowing models of which clients are, which clients are most likely to leave us and then we approach them kind of proactively through a retention team. I think all of those have that and the great service, which we are at historic highs for our net promoter score as well. I think are all benefiting that, getting us to the best. So do I think we can do a little bit better than that? I think so. But I just think it does have a top limit because of just the number of out of businesses that happened in the small business market. Kevin McVeigh : And then just real quick, obviously, we've taken about 200 basis points investment, put it back into the business. But you've shifted a lot of the capacity of the cloud. So just trying to get a sense, where are we in that cloud evolution, number one, and then just obviously, there's certain amount of margin benefit from that as well. I guess, twofold, when do some of those investments run off? And then what's the uplift on the margin, as the capacity is done through the cloud as opposed to the traditional service? Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think, pretty much, you can say everything is pretty much in the cloud now, the way the clients approach us and where our services are. I mean, everything is software as a service, and everything is built as I said, mobile first, everything is available that way. I think some of the additional investments that we've made and talked about will start to run off at the end of this year. We made an investment and a very deliberate investment, to speed up some of the product development that we could see ourselves doing in the future, instead, to take advantage of the tax savings, to instead of just run it off of the bottom line in a one-time kind of fashion.  Hey, let's put some of this to accelerate the product development, we've been very happy with that. Obviously, it's driven the best client satisfaction and retention scores; it's improved our sales overall, our part growth is the best that's been in three years from a sales perspective. So we're feeling like the right investments were put in place for sales, for telephonic sales, for demand generation through marketing, and through IT, but some of that through the IT will start to come off towards the back of the year. I don't think we've given, hey, what that will do necessarily, the margins are probably will. But at this point, but it will roll off, some of that will go back down to a little bit less investment, normalized investment toward the end of this fiscal year. Efrain Rivera : Hey, Kevin, one other thing to answer that question qualitatively. As Marty said, the investments start to roll off as we exit this year, which is what we had said before. At that point, in the absence of any change in the mix of the business, you would expect operating margins now to start to float back up. The only caveat that I've said when I get asked on that question is what is the growth of the PEO, because the PEO has a moderating impact on margins. Now, the offset to that would be faster revenue growth potentially, but I would say as we go through the year, we'll have better sense of kind of what the overall margin of -- the underlying margin uplift excluding PEO is going to go up. PEO will have an impact, though, overall, depending on mix. Kevin McVeigh : And Efrain if I could real quick, are you kind of where you are from a headcount perspective? Or would there be some more optimization based on kind of how the capacity sits? Martin Mucci : You mean, just I in general, or are you specific to anything? Kevin McVeigh : I would say just the, either, however you want to answer that. Martin Mucci : I think, look, we're always -- we've got a history of being very profitable and making sure that we keep our costs low. I think we continue to always look for leverage. As Efrain said, the change in the margins have been mostly because of the PEO business, and the way that that hits your financials drives a lot of revenue, but also has higher expenses and brings the kind of margin percent down. But I think we're always looking for ways to continue to leverage and I think the investments we've made, but again, back to when you think about artificial intelligence to chatbots, and so forth, answering 60%, 70% of the questions, we certainly are looking to continue to drive some headcount down where it's not needed.  But we've also been very good at then reinvesting that headcount where it is needed. So for years, we've taken headcount out of operations, where we got more efficient and put it into technology, where we knew the market was going. So, I'm not sure head count itself, it will all depend on where the growth is. And of course, we've grown headcount, really because of the growth in the business, not necessarily we haven't -- we've never really de-leveraged from a headcount perspective in my, at least 15 years, we've always driven head count down, but may have invested that somewhere else. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Tien- tsin Huang : Just a quick question on retention, you had a lot of good questions there already. But just on Oasis specifically, do you have pretty good line of sight now on the retention there in the initial period, I can't remember if you said that there's an opportunity to maybe improve retention there, once you apply the, maybe the Paychex lay there or not? Efrain Rivera : We really haven't broken that out. I think we have a pretty good line of sight that it's been pretty solid. We had no surprises whatsoever, which is always good. And on acquisition, I think they've done a good job on the service side and selling to the right clients. We have not seen any fallout from insurance plan changes or anything else at this point. So I think the retention has been solid. And, there's always -- we're always looking for ways to improve it. But we certainly did not have any surprises and we're very satisfied with where they are on retention. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana of Jefferies. Samad Samana : So Marty, based in your commentary, it looks like retention was up 100 basis points to 81% on last year's 10-K, you mentioned it's over 82% this fiscal year that just ended. So I'm curious, why did gross new customer adds grow in \u2013 or in fiscal \u201819 versus fiscal \u201818. I'm just trying to parse how much of that 3.1% total customer growth was driven by the improvement in gross retention versus new customer adds? Martin Mucci : Yeah, it's a mix of both. We don't break it out and we don't give that level of detail. But certainly, the overall growth of clients was a benefit of both good sales results and a little bit better retention. Just that improvement and retention alone on the payroll side would not have made that total difference there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of Baird. Mark Marcon : I was wondering, you mentioned that in the mid market, you ended up seeing good growth. And I'm wondering specifically, were there some new additions to the overall bundle that\u2019s driving that? What's the primary driver do you think of the improvement there? And I'll leave it there for now. Efrain Rivera : I think a couple of things. One, I think, certainly the product adjustments that were or the product enhancements that we've made, so adding data analytics, adding a new HR centre, what we call HR centre gives performance management support. Also, I did mention the learning management. So everything that's needed this year from a recruiting, training, the personnel development that clients have been looking for, prospects are looking for, we have added and made it much stronger. And so I think from a product set, that's very good.  From a sales perspective, I think the approach of going totally with HR and the HR need has been very strong as well. So I think the approach of selling HR and approaching the client from their total HR needs has been strong and sales are up, probably the best growth we've seen again in three years in the mid market. And we seem to be on a good path to start the new fiscal year as well. Mark Marcon : That's great. And then any change in terms of the profile of those mid market clients in terms of who you're winning them from, or what sort of systems they had in place previously? Efrain Rivera : No, I don't think so. I think from any of the competitors, I think we're doing pretty well, it's been pretty consistent. I think we're obviously winning a few more I think than we were. And I think that's again, the sales execution is stronger, the sales training is stronger, and the product itself is stronger. So we're pretty pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the mid market. And I wouldn't say it's from any one competitor. I think we're doing pretty well against all of them when you compare it historically. Mark Marcon : Great. And then with regards to the improvements that you've made, it's been a very short period of time that you've already ramped up in terms of the chatbots, and the ability to answer questions, and you're getting the 60% to 70% of them now, where do you think that goes in a couple of years? Efrain Rivera : See, I think, I mean, based on the improvement so far, and what I read, when you research this kind of around the country, I would think you could get up to 75%, maybe even 80%. And it's so easy. Well, I think it's easy, but our development team might not, but it's so -- you can be so responsive to the feedback of seeing if the question was answered or not that you get so much better about refining the questions that they're being able to read the questions or asking and respond to that, but I definitely think it could get up into the 75% range anyway, maybe even 80%. Mark Marcon : And you're directly tying the improvement in terms of the client retention and the client satisfaction scores to people who utilize the chatbot or being serviced? Efrain Rivera : I wouldn't say if that direct yet. I don't have it, that\u2019s specific, but I think it certainly is part of it. I mean, we really ramped that up this year. And obviously, we've seen good satisfaction and we get good results. We always ask the client, after they've received their answers to dissatisfy what you were looking for. And we're getting very good feedback on that and very good results. So it certainly I think has helped on the client satisfaction, but I think primarily, the satisfaction has been on the product, the ability of the product to serve the client, the ease of use of the product and the great service, personalized service that we're providing. Mark Marcon : And then with regards to the self implementation on the small end, I know it's really early days, but are you seeing any sort of, maybe too early to tell, but is there any difference in terms of the client retention level that you see from clients that are willing to self implement? Efrain Rivera : I think it's a little early to really have enough data there. But, what you do see is typically clients who set themselves up historically, even in a small sample, are more likely to be retained, because they feel like it was their fault that there was a problem because they set themselves up. And therefore, they own it a little bit more and they're a little more tolerant of giving us a chance to help fix the issue that they may have created. Mark Marcon : And then lastly, just workers\u2019 comp for next year, and how we should think about Insurance Services. I'm not talking about the next fiscal year beyond the one that you've already guided for. But for the second half, when we go into the new calendar year, are you assuming that workers\u2019 comp rates are going to be down 15% to 25% in terms of your overall assumption, and then within PEO and insurance, were you expecting the insurance part to be down? Efrain Rivera : Okay, so that's a compound question, you\u2019ve got two pieces to it. So let me just parse them. So with respect to workers\u2019 comp, workers, the workers\u2019 comp I'm talking about is not workers\u2019 comp that has anything to do with a PEO. So, take that out of your mind. So it\u2019s purely the workers\u2019 comp, yeah, Paychex\u2019s workers comp. So I would say, Mark, I don't know in the back half specifically, how much we have is down. But certainly in the first half, where we declined pretty significantly versus first half of last year and then it starts to moderate, the decline starts to moderate in the back half of the year, because we started to experience the declines in workers\u2019 comp heavily in third and fourth quarters. So I think it moderates as we go through the year. I would not expect the 15% to 20% down in fourth quarter, again, that's -- way too much. I would think we're getting closer to kind of flat or maybe even slightly above by the time we get to purchase, because we're anniversarying some sharp declines in the back half of the year. Mark Marcon : And then just for the Insurance Services revenue? Efrain Rivera : So insurance in total? No, because health and benefits is growing nicely, actually had a good quarter revenue wise for health and benefits. This is again, health insurance is to Paychex\u2019s clients. That's growing nicely at upper single digits. And, we'd expect that to continue to grow and grow nicely through the balance of the year. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Steven Wald : It\u2019s Steven Wald on for James. Just maybe one quick one, following up on the margin discussion, I think you said all else equal past sort of 2020, results with Oasis, expect the margin to sort of float up. I think on the last call, you have talked about expecting year-over-year EBITDA margin improvement in 2021. Can you speak to whether that's still your expectation? And also, maybe sort of, if the okay times are good times however you want to call it continue, what the sort of upper limit is on the EBITDA or operating margin? Efrain Rivera : Yeah, I'll answer the first and can\u2019t answer yet the second. I think we need to have a full year of Oasis under our belt to understand what the behavior of costs is in the business, we understand it will be in 21. We would expect EBITDA margin to float up in \u201821. There's many reasons for that. But, I think that we should see some improvement on EBITDA margin. What is the ceiling of that? A little bit early to say at this point? We'll have a better sense as we go through the year. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019ll now return the call to Mr. Mucci for any additional or closing remarks. Martin Mucci : Thank you. And at this point, we\u2019ll close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast, the conference call will be archived for approximately 30 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our fourth quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude the Paychex fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex. Please go ahead. Martin Mucci : Thank you, and good morning and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2019. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet, will be archived and available on our website for about approximately 1 month. On today\u2019s call, I will review business highlights for the first quarter, Efrain will review our first quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal 2020, and then we will open it up for your questions. We are pleased with the solid start to the fiscal year 2020. Our financial results reflect good progress in operations and sales. Total revenue growth was 15% for the first quarter, including the incremental results from Oasis Outsourcing Group, which we acquired back in December of \u201818, Management Solutions revenue grew 5%, while PEO and Insurance Services revenues grew 56%. And not only are we off to a solid financial start, but our client retention and satisfaction continue to be at record high levels and sales continues to perform well as we start this fiscal year. We are excited to introduce several new technology enhancements and solutions at HR Tech, which is happening this week in Las Vegas, and as a longstanding leader in this human capital management space, we have insight into the needs of our clients and their employees and see trends in our markets. These new solutions address key developments in payments, wearable devices, integrations, and data and analytics. Our new wearable solutions allow Paychex Flex time users to track time worked on with their smartwatch, employees can clock in and out with a simple tap of the watch. It also makes time and attendance tracking easier for the increasingly remote workforces with enhanced geofencing capabilities, which remind employees the punch out as they leave their work locations. This is the first of many potential use cases utilizing wearable solutions that we will be making available to Flex users. We are also excited to be introducing pay-on-demand and real-time payments by the end of calendar year 2019. Paychex clients can allow employees to access a portion of their earned pay before the scheduled check date. With many Americans living paycheck to paycheck, this advancement in technology allows financial flexibility when needed. Following this enhancement, then in early 2020, we will be offering the option to have earned funds deposited in an employee\u2019s bank account in real time. Real-time payment is an extension of our market-leading innovative technology. We will be one of the first providers to offer real-time payments or employee direct deposits, continuing our position as a tech leader in this space. While Paychex offers the full breadth of services across the HCM spectrum integrated into our Flex platform, we understand that clients may prefer to keep some solutions they use in place. Our Paychex product integration is a private marketplace that takes the company\u2019s integration partner strategy a step further, continuing to simplify the process for customers looking to connect Paychex Flex with some of the most popular HR, accounting, point-of-sale, and productivity applications on the market today. Clients can determine how and when an integration deploys with the ability to \u2013 for it to happen real time, regularly scheduled or based on an action within their Flex platform. Our robust and continually evolving set of APIs allows clients the flexibility to choose how they receive their services through one integrated provider or by using various HR solutions. Data and analytics are areas of increasing focus. Paychex has a rich and reliable depository of data gathered from interactions with clients. We are pleased to introduce the Paychex Flex intelligence engine. One aspect of this feature is the Paychex Flex Assistant, which we have discussed before. This is our customer service chatbot introduced last year, which continues to evolve and be enhanced. Our users in-app interactions with Flex Assistant allows them to elect a preference for their learning via written how to documents, tutorial-style video, vignette short videos, or a guided interactive tour. Coming in December, the chatbot will offer these options during every customer interaction, providing the ultimate and learning flexibility. At any time, a live Paychex agent is just a click away to provide personalized service experience based on the context collected through the bot 7/24/365. Paychex is the only company to offer that personalized service option in our space, 7/24/365 days a year. Through machine learning, our chatbot continually expands its knowledge base and provides a more robust data set to leverage and formulate answers to frequently asked questions. During the past quarter, we approached 0.25 million sessions interacting with the Flex Assistant, the bot is able to address approximately 200 commonly asked questions, and that number is growing. In addition to these exciting introductions during HR Tech, during the quarter, we also provided a set of enhancements to our solutions designed to help common \u2013 solve common HR and payroll challenges including Paychex Solo, a bundled offering designed to meet the specific needs of sole proprietors, which includes a payroll, incorporation services, and a solo retirement plan, a new customizable, new grid entry view for payroll, electronic app Form I-9 and E-Verify processes that is integrated with our paperless onboarding, HR conversations, this is a tool in our performance management module that enables collaboration between employees, managers, and HR staff; and document management, a centralized and secure digital file repository for company forms, policies, references, and employee documents and certifications. We are singularly focused on continued innovation to meet not only our customers but also their employees\u2019 evolving needs, simplify HR complexities and offer solutions to help them thrive and grow. Also, we are offering cyber \u2013 cyberattacks are a growing threat to businesses of all sizes. We are now making cybersecurity liability protection available to our clients through our Paychex Insurance Agency and Access Insurance Company, a leading cybersecurity insurance carrier. This solution helps business owners mitigate, and the potential impact of financial \u2013 impact of data breaches, hackers, and ransomware and online banking fraud. It is particularly critical for businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees since 60% fail within six months of the cyberattack due to a lack of resources to offset the breach. Shifting to our PEO business, the acquisition of Oasis was the largest acquisition in our history and double the number of work site employees we serve in our PEO. We are making steady progress on our integration plans and we are now focused on completing the integration of our sales and service teams. Through all of these efforts, we remain focused on what is most important, serving our clients and their employees and growing our PEO. We launched new branding for our HR outsourcing solutions including our Paychex PEO and ASO solutions. This new product brand Paychex One conveys the power of a comprehensive, flexible, total HR solution that can scale and meet the needs of any business at every stage of their development. We\u2019re also very proud that for the ninth consecutive year now, Paychex has earned the distinction of being the retirement industries leader number one in the total number of defined contribution plans. This ranking was announced as part of the annual 401-K record keeping survey published by PLANSPONSOR Magazine. We provide solutions to remove the complexity of saving for retirement and this is an integral part of the package for our clients to use as part of the recruitment for new talent, as well as retaining talent. Recent enhancements to our mobile app make enrollment in the retirement plan possible with only four clicks. This is already led to an increase in participant enrollment, which will lead as well to improved client retention. We also ranked number three on sellers Selling Power 50 best companies to Sell For list in 2019. This is the seventh consecutive year we have appeared on the list and our ranking reflects our commitment to providing our sales teams every opportunity to succeed. We continue to return exceptional value to our shareholders, and in May, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend of $0.06 or 11% to $0.62 per share. Our dividend yield remains of approximately 3%, a leader in this market. And during the first quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares of common stock. In summary, we continue to focus on the growth of our business, providing great value and convenience to our client our state-of-the-art technology allows our service to our clients and their employees the way they want, when they want, where they want. We\u2019re focused on providing technology-enabled service to improve business efficiency and meet our clients\u2019 needs. Our full suite of HCM product offerings and world class service is a powerful combination that positions us for sustainable growth. The continued efforts of our employees and their commitment to our clients, is making a difference. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera and Efrain is going to review our financial results for the first quarter. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Hey, thanks, Marty and good morning. I would like to remind you that today\u2019s conference call contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such, involve risks. Please refer to the customary disclosures. In addition, I\u2019ll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted operating \u2013 diluted earnings per share, sorry. Please refer to our press release and investor presentation for a discussion of these measures and a reconciliation for the first quarter to their related GAAP measures. I will start by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter and then follow up with some greater detail in certain areas. I will wrap with the review of our fiscal 2020 outlook. As you saw, total revenue and total service revenue both grew 15% for the first quarter. Our growth excluding Oasis was between 5% and 6%. Expenses increased 18% for the first quarter to $643 million. Increases in compensation-related costs, PEO direct insurance costs and amortization of intangible assets contributed to total expense growth for the first quarter, primarily driven by the acquisition of Oasis. Operating income increased 9% to $349 million. Operating margin was 35.2% for the first quarter. EBITDA increased 13%. And EBITDA margin was approximately 41% for the first quarter. Margins were moderated by business mix due to growth in the PEO business and accelerated investments in sales, technology and operations. Other expense net for the first quarter of $5 million includes interest expense of $8 million related to our long-term borrowings. As a reminder, we used $800 million of private placement bonds to fund a portion of the Oasis purchase price. Effective income tax rate was 23.3% for the first quarter compared to 24.5% for the same period last year. Net income increased 8% to $264 million and adjusted net income increased 6% to $258 million for the first quarter. Diluted EPS increased 9% to $0.73 for the first quarter and adjusted diluted EPS increased 6% to $0.71. We received approximately $0.02 of benefit from stock-based compensation payments during the first quarter, which we exclude in our adjusted diluted EPS. I will now provide some additional color in selected areas. Management Solutions revenue increased 5% to $724 million for the first quarter. The increase was primarily driven by increases in our client bases across many of our services and growth in revenue per client, which improved as a result of price increases net of discounts. Retirement Services revenue also benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the asset value participant funds and we had a strong quarter in Management Solutions, if you recall the guide I gave you for Q1. PEO and Insurance Services revenue increased 56% to $247 million for the first quarter. In addition to the acquisition of Oasis, the increase was driven by growth in clients and client worksite employees across our combined existing PEO business. Insurance Services revenue was moderated by softness in the workers comp premiums. This was partially offset by an increase in the number of health and benefit clients and applicants. Interest on funds held for clients increased 20% for the first quarter to $21 million, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates earned. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased 1% for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Investments and income, we continue to invest primarily in high \u2013 not primarily, but in high credit quality securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 2.1% currently and an average duration of 3.1 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 2% for the first quarter, up from 1.8% from last year. I will now walk through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of approximately $700 million as of August 31, 2019. Funds held for clients were $3.8 billion, consistent with the balance as of the end of last fiscal year, May 31. I\u2019ll remind you that funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.7 billion for the first quarter. Total available-for-sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $53 million as of August 31, compared with $20 million as of May 31, 2019. Stockholders\u2019 equity was $2.5 billion as of August 31, reflecting $222 million in dividends paid and $172 million worth of shares repurchased during the quarter. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a robust 42%. Cash flows from operations were $295 million for the first quarter, an increase of 8% from the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher net income and non-cash adjustments offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in non-cash adjustments was primarily due to higher amortization expense, largely driven by intangible assets acquired through the acquisition of Oasis. Now, let me talk about guidance for the balance of the year. I remind you that our outlook is based upon current view of economic conditions and trends and business trends continue with no significant changes. So we have reflected the impact of the two interest rate cuts that have already occurred this fiscal year. So we are not at this point including additional guidance on further rate cuts; we\u2019re uncertain about what will happen in the balance of the year. I will provide our current outlook and then add color in a couple of areas. We provided updates to the guidance. As you saw, on the strength of a strong quarter in Q1, we now think Management Solutions revenue is anticipated to grow 5% above the range of previous guidance of approximately 4%. We thought that first quarter would be a sequentially a little weaker; we actually got out of the gate a little bit stronger. PEO and Insurances revenue is now anticipated to grow approximately 30% at the lower end of the previously provided range of 30% to 35%, more to come on that but we started a little slower than we had originally contemplated. Other expense net, which was previously referred to as net interest expense, is anticipated to be in the range of $18 million to $20 million, a modest change from previously reported guidance of $15 million to $18 million here due to interest rate changes. And if you remember what that is, is a combination of interest income and interest expense. So the decrease in interest rate changes effects what we will earn on the corporate portfolio. Net income and diluted earnings per share are both now anticipated to grow 9% above the range of our prior guidance of approximately 8% and adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are both expected to increase approximately 9% above the range of our previous guidance of growth in the range of 8% to 9%. Other guidance remains unchanged. Interest on funds held for clients anticipated to grow in the range of 4% to 8%, that\u2019s what we said at the beginning of the year and that\u2019s what we\u2019re sticking with. We assume that there was a good probability that there would be a second rate cut it happened and that was contemplated in the guidance. Total revenue anticipated to grow in the same range of 10% to 11%. Operating income as a percent of total revenue anticipated to be approximately 36%, although inching ever so slightly up. EBITDA margin for the full year fiscal 2020 is expected to be approximately 41%. And the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2020 is expected to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%, although we anticipate that now will be toward the high-end. As I indicated PEO and Insurance revenues are now anticipated to grow approximately 30%. We anticipate that growth for the second quarter will be in the range of 56% to 60% and growth in the second half of the fiscal year will be within the range previously provided of 11% to 14%, but at the lower end of that range. PEO and Insurance revenues growth was partially impacted by change in classification of an immaterial Oasis revenue stream out of PEO and Insurance services into Management Solutions after we last provided guidance. So make sure when you look at the presentation we posted that you got the right beginning number; it\u2019s not a big difference, but make sure you\u2019re working off that number as you look at updating your models. Management Solutions, in addition, we have experienced lower workers\u2019 compensation insurance rates that moderated our insurance services growth. It was a little softer than we had anticipated in Q1. We anticipate the trend eases as we go through the year, but started a little bit slowly there and we are also anticipating modestly lower at risk insurance attachment in our PEO business based on current trends and the number for us, if it\u2019s not at risk insurance, we don\u2019t recognize it as revenue. So our business can do very well without having significant at risk insurance attachment. We looking at the trends, think it will be a little bit lower than we had originally projected. Now in contrast, Management Solutions guidance was increased to approximately 5% growth from our previous guidance of approximately 4% growth due to favorable trends we\u2019ve seen during the first quarter. In addition, Management Solutions has increased partially due to the change of classification of the immaterial Oasis revenue stream and had a negligible effect in the first quarter and will have a negligible effect for the remainder of the year. For the second quarter, we expect growth at approximately 5% and then between 4% and 5% in the back half of the fiscal year. Operating margins, which for the full year are anticipated to be approximately 36%, very quarterly as you probably captured in your models for Q2, we expect margins to be in the range of 33% to 34% and for the second half of the year, we expect to see them at approximately 38%. So in the second half we are anticipating at this point approximately 38% margins. I got asked a lot after the guidance that we expect to see higher margins in the back half of the year and the answer is yes. Now, I refer you to our investor slides on our website for more information. And with all of that, I will turn it back to Marty. Martin Mucci : Thank you, Efrain. Maria, we will now open the call to questions, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you kind of a general question about your pricing strategy. Marty, you walked through a lot of really interesting kind of product innovation that\u2019s happening. When you are able to raise prices, is it always in conjunction with a new enhancement or in addition to value, or are you still able to just raise prices on a renewal just due to the underlying kind of stickiness and competitive moat of the product? I am just trying to understand whether pricing is kind of tied to innovation or really it\u2019s just something you can leverage due to the underlying kind of competitive moat you have? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think it\u2019s still both. I think we are seeing not only for the innovation in bundling more things together, but also the normal price increase that we have given guidance on pretty consistently, is held up pretty well. So, we had our kind of normal annual price increase, and we have seen that hold up pretty well. And I think that\u2019s part of where you are seeing management solutions -- is holding is better than we originally projected, it\u2019s because of that. So, actually we have the pricing power both ways, I feel at this point. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And then on the PEO and insurance segment in the quarter, so the deceleration there \u2013 there are few puts and takes there that you mentioned, both of you mentioned, the softness \u2013 is the implied sort of deceleration in the quarter in PEO and insurance just really solely or more due to the softness on the insurance side. Can you just sort of speak to the underlying growth rate of PEO sort of ex-Oasis in the quarter and kind of disaggregate the insurance from the PEO performance for us? Efrain Rivera : Yes, thanks, Ramsey. So, I would say, just to be clear, the PEO business has been growing solid double-digits. So, it grew very well in the quarter. We knew that workers\u2019 comp was coming up against a tough compare because much of the softness in workers\u2019 comp occurred in the back half of last fiscal, and so it was a little bit more pronounced than we anticipated; that\u2019s part one. And then part two is, in the PEO, the attachment of at-risk insurance impacts the revenue; it has no impact, there is very little impact I should say on margins. So, we saw a little bit less at-risk insurance attachment in the quarter. I would just mention that, that varies widely from quarter to quarter. So, you can find a big client that has a lot of work \u2013 I am sorry, that has a lot of healthcare attachment, the revenues go up. It really does \u2013 it changes your margin, but it doesn\u2019t do much for the bottom line. So, we saw a little bit of softness on both of those. Ramsey El-Assal: That\u2019s great color. Thanks so much. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thank you. Hey, Marty. Hey Efrain. Nice job on the Management Solutions. Can you give us a sense of how much of that was better retention as opposed to just any thoughts around kind of what drove that upside? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think I will let Efrain speak to some of it, too, but the client retention has continued to be at our highest level. So we are feeling very good. We ended last year with a record high, and we continued right through the first quarter. So, we feel very good about the client retention piece of it and then there were a few other changes that Efrain wants to speak to. Efrain Rivera : Yes. So, Kevin, we saw, as Marty mentioned, strong retention in the quarter. We had strong rate meaning combination of discounts and price increases sticking those were good. We had increases in the client base. We had a lot of good things happen in the quarter that make us incrementally more bullish. I would say two other things that are important relative to the results in the quarter, the first is that we saw very good performance coming out of our mid-market segment on the sales side, which also helped. It was really not a significant contributor, but it made us incrementally more bullish going into the back half of the year. And the other thing I would say is that we saw strong performance coming out of our PEO business from a sales standpoint that also even though the revenue was a little softer, we feel pretty good about where we are at. By the way, just a final point on that, worksite employees \u2013 before I get the question, worksite employees \u2013 worksite employee growth was strong in the quarter. Kevin McVeigh : Great. And then it\u2019s interesting because obviously you are seeing overall payroll slow, it seems like your business fundamentally is accelerating. Marty, is that kind of the benefit from the investments the last couple of years or you are kind of repositioning the company or just any thoughts on that? Martin Mucci : Well, yes, I think we definitely have been repositioning the company from a couple of standpoints. One is from a tech perspective, the company is much more \u2013 Paychex is much more of a technology company now providing service as well than it has been in the past, and all the investments are really paying off like the things that I listed out. This is and it\u2019s impacting not only the clients in their retention and their value and satisfaction, but also the employees of the clients. So, our business and the products that we are introducing very much focuses on the employees, and it\u2019s kind of perfect timing for a market that\u2019s difficult to hire and retain employees for small and midsized businesses. So, the fact that you have a 401(k) for example is that you can sign up for \u2013 participants can sign up for clicks on a mobile app that\u2019s a 5-star rated app and makes it easy to sign up.  That participation is up double-digits as that drives better retention of 401(k). That also drives retention of the employees and it\u2019s better for the clients. The other positioning of the company is certainly more to HR. The sales process today is very much about an HR overall need than it is for payroll by itself and we have been positioning the company that way whether it\u2019s through PEO or frankly through the power of kind of over 3,000 sales people. We use the power of those 3,000 sales people to not necessarily the old way sell payroll then call them back for other services, but basically look at their needs upfront and sell the value of HR in the full product suite that Paychex can offer upfront. So definitely the company has been \u2013 we have been repositioning the technology side of it and the HR side of it and that has made a big difference as payroll has become more or less \u2013 more of a commodity type of thing and the need of the client has been much more about HR retirement, the HR generalist. We have 600 HR generalists now out there serving the worksite employees that we serve either PEO and ASO. It\u2019s a huge need now given the changes in regulations in complexity. Kevin McVeigh : Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI. Rayna Kumar : Good morning. This is Rayna Kumar for David Togut. Martin Mucci : Hi, Rayna. Rayna Kumar : Hi. You called out another strong sales bookings quarter, could you maybe discuss in which products and segments in the market you saw the best growth? Martin Mucci : Well, we don\u2019t break it down too much that we get past selling season in the next quarter or so when we have a better sense of the year, but definitely, as Efrain mentioned the mid-market sales in particular, we saw very strong growth and this has been more of a challenge in the last couple of years for us. Once we got the investments in technology and product out there, we also have very solid leadership team in that mid-market and we performed extremely well in that first quarter. So, I would say certainly the PEO, the retirement business, etcetera, but when you look at the mid-market stands out certainly from the start of the year and actually as we ended last year as well, but this first quarter was really strong in the mid-market. And that\u2019s a real positive to us because we had, certainly over the last couple of years, hadn\u2019t been quite as strong as we thought we needed to be and we are very pleased with where we started out. Rayna Kumar : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. You called out a number of real-time payment products, can you maybe discuss the timeline for rollout and the revenue model associated with these products? Martin Mucci : Well, the end of this calendar year, we will have the kind of pay-on-demand so to make sure that we are clear on that. So the pay-on-demand obviously offers employees of clients the ability to take some wages out earlier than waiting for their 2-week period or etcetera, real-time payments we see coming in early 2020. We think we will be one of the first, if not the first, to offer real-time payments. This is really more of a accelerate \u2013 we offer same day ACH today. If you have a last minute change in your payroll, if you need to make some changes, if you need to do something at the last minute and be sure the funds are there and there is some charges for that and we expect there will be some charges for real-time payments which takes that to the next level of making it immediately available. Real-time ACH has \u2013 ACH same-day has some limitations from a timing perspective depending on banks and so forth and real-time payments will really kind of wipe out most of those limitations and you will be able to get funds in your employees\u2019 accounts basically in real-time. Rayna Kumar : Great. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Jim Schneider : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wonder if any follow-up on the improvement that you called out both in Management Solutions and also the mid-market, is that more a function of the enhancements you have made with Paychex Flex, any color you can put around that? And also maybe just talk about how much of that\u2019s being improved by the sales force enhancements and channel strategy? Anything in terms of color you could provide around that will be great? Martin Mucci : Yes, sure. I think it\u2019s a little bit of both. I think certainly the product is the enhancements to Flex have been pretty significant, not only from the payroll side, but the integration side at all, some of the products and features that we discussed today even like the payroll grid offering many more options and making it just easier for them to use from a payroll standpoint, but the integration of the HR and I think the sales team and sales, so their effectiveness and the sales approach being much more about HR first instead of leading with payrolls coming in and offering the full suite of products that we offer. And then also as I mentioned today in the comments offering others to have \u2013 we have a full set of APIs to other providers of on-demand services and HR products and accounting products and that is getting broader and I think we see that as well. We certainly offer a one solution set. That\u2019s the great thing about Paychex. We can have it all fully integrated into Flex if you want it, but if you are on an HR or an accounting system that you want to make sure you keep an interface into Flex, you can do that as well. So I think it\u2019s that approach. I also think the employee approach, Jim, that I mentioned earlier, really doing things with the mobile app that is making self-service more available to their employees, not only their check stub, their W-2s, signing up and signing off on time in attendance, changing schedules, setting up your 401(k), all of that is adding a lot of value to the mid-market in particular and we are seeing that pay off for us. So we are very pleased with the first quarter start. Jim Schneider : Great. And then maybe as a follow-up, on the PEO, the reduced guidance you called out several of these idiosyncratic factors on the insurance side, but I want to make sure that I am clear in terms of what you are seeing in the core PEO business. Is there any slowdown there either in terms of market demand or from a competitive positioning standpoint and maybe just talk about how the Oasis expected growth is doing relative to what you thought was going to be? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So, Jim, so two parts of that. So the short answer is, no, but let me explain why because it\u2019s important to understand. So, when some questions started to rise \u2013 started to get calls relative to what are you seeing with respect to worksite employee growth within existing clients, I did a deeper dive to understand what was going on and we are seeing solid worksite employee growth within existing clients. So, that was an issue that came up and was commented on. So we are not seeing any of that. That\u2019s one. Second, if I look at worksite employee growth, worksite employee growth again has been solid in the quarter. So we are not seeing anything there. On the Oasis side, in order for us to get fully optimized on the sales side for Oasis, we are in the process of ramping our sales efforts there and I think that process is ongoing. So, it\u2019s \u2013 there \u2013 I agree that it\u2019s somewhat idiosyncratic the reasons for the slight modification in the guidance, but it has no \u2013 it really is not indicative of any changes both in demand patterns and in or the underlying market. If I called out the growth rate on sales in PEO I will just say this, it\u2019s multiples of revenue growth. So that\u2019s one reason why we feel pretty comfortable about where we are at. Jim Schneider : Yes. And the trends in Oasis you are seeing? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I was just talking primarily on the sales side, the integration is going well and we are in the process of pulling it into the Paychex family growth. Martin Mucci : Yes, we are at the point of just finalizing all the combination of the sales teams and the service teams, but we feel like the integration has gone well and we are feeling very good about it. We are also, of course, with Paychex and with that integration, we have the insurance agency, the 21st largest in the country. So when underwriting, if it doesn\u2019t fit the PEO, we have that option to take them through the insurance agency that some of the changes that Efrain mentioned as well, we are getting more through that insurance agency and that\u2019s going as well. So you don\u2019t want to turn down a client, that many times Oasis had to turn down in the past possibly over underwriting, we can now move them to the agency and offer them insurance through the agency itself. So, we feel good about the start here and the integration is certainly on track. Jim Schneider : Good to hear. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from James Berkley of Wolfe Research. James Berkley : Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Not to beat the dead horse on the PEO side, but I guess just trying to be like more direct. Are you guys still trending a couple of quarters ago you said bookings in PEO space for like low-double digits, are you guys still in that range? And then on the worksite employee growth, I think it was double-digits last quarter, can you confirm, it\u2019s still double-digits this quarter? Efrain Rivera : I think I said that, James. It was strong. James Berkley : Yes, okay. And then I guess Efrain, just we talked a few days ago, I guess just about that new HRA rule, it could be helpful just for investors to hear your thoughts on the impact there it\u2019s coming into play in January 2020? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So this is new legislation that makes it easier for employers to use HRAs as an alternative for funding of healthcare plans and the questions that have come up from investors around the impact on the PEO side of the ledger will this impact annual growth and we have looked at it and of course until it\u2019s in place and people are actually having the opportunity to take advantage of HRAs in a different way, it\u2019s \u2013 you can\u2019t say 100%, but we feel pretty comfortable that should not have a significant impact on PEO growth. Martin Mucci : Yes, we have had \u2013 we have offered HRAs through \u2013 for some time, I don\u2019t think even with the legislation that gives some support and credit, so I think it doesn\u2019t seem like employers are going to run from traditional insurance plans to do the funding. We have offered those as I said for some time and seen \u2013 not have seen a great uptake. I think there are some businesses that do that, but I don\u2019t think there will be any major shift that we would expect that, that\u2019s going to happen from traditional insurance plans over to the HRAs. James Berkley : Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Lisa Ellis : Hi. Good morning, guys. I guess I will ask the inevitable macroeconomic question. Marty, can you give some color on what you are seeing on sort of the second order dynamics around the macro environment? I know you have a very unique look into things like obviously employment growth, but also like small business survival rates, the attach rates, the value-added services like benefits, etcetera. Can you give us a little color there? Thank you. Martin Mucci : Yes, I think we reported our small business index yesterday and it actually we had an uptick from September to August. One month doesn\u2019t make a year or trend, but job growth actually ticked up a bit and these were businesses under 50 employees and we saw some growth not only or improvement in the job growth, it\u2019s still down about 1% less job growth from last year, but this was the first time we have seen an uptick in a couple of years where it moved up month to month. We also saw wages in hours worked up. So, wages looking pushed up from about 2.6% wage increase, the 2.8% and hours worked went up. So, I think small businesses are still feeling overall a little shaky on the economy and what\u2019s going to happen, but generally they are getting good product demand for their services and there is still their biggest challenges hiring enough people to fulfill the demand. So we also did a business sentiment report and everything was positive, everything had gone up from the previous report probably 6 to 9 months ago that felt that it would be easier for them to \u2013 a little bit easier for them to hire, a little easier for them to get capital. So I think while the economy itself makes them a little cautious, I think that they are feeling like right now they are getting good product demand and their biggest challenge is hiring. So you saw the hours go up, because they are working with they have more to fulfill the demand and the wages are going up as they are trying to raise wages to get to pickup the employees. So, overall pretty positive actually with our latest report that just came out yesterday. Efrain Rivera : The other thing we said and Marty mentioned this yesterday is SMEs are typically a little less impacted by slowdowns in global trade. So that segment of the economy obviously larger multinationals and enterprise level companies are starting to feel the pinch. You are not feeling as much of that lower down the employee count. So, it\u2019s not impossible to have results like this in one segment of the economy where you see more concerned and pessimism in another part of the economy. Martin Mucci : Yes. We have talked about tariffs and trade issues and we found in serving clients that about three quarters of that small businesses, are not impacted. Generally, they are regional businesses. They are the lawyer\u2019s office, the doctor\u2019s office, the restaurants, etcetera, the contractors, they are not impacted. The 25%, a quarter than our, have a little bit tougher time changing their supply chain and so forth, they don\u2019t have the leverage of larger companies, but three quarters of them really don\u2019t feel like they would be impacted by trade issues or tariff issues. Lisa Ellis : Alright. And then maybe as my follow-up, can you and this is \u2013 Efrain, give your perspective or your best perspective on how you anticipate the PEO business performing if and when we see a macro slowdown. I mean, I know there is an argument that PEO should actually tick up because the cost and economic value proposition is so strong for small businesses, but then on the other hand, it\u2019s also got a perks component to it. Just what\u2019s your view on that? Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Yes. So I think the first thing to understand that question is, what\u2019s the average size, at least in our base, for PEOs and typically a PEO in our world is in the 25 to 30 employee range. So you\u2019re comfortably out of the 20 and under-zone where you would tend to see more of an impact from a macro slowdown and what I mean by that specifically is 20 and above, you start to see a lot less impact from business failures in the event of a downturn. You see that Increasing as you go down the employee count. So now you\u2019re in an area of the economy where \u2013 the employers where you tend to see less of an impact from macroeconomic slowdown. And then the question is, in that kind of environment, do you have a greater demand for HR services or do you have a lower demand for HR services, and when you think about it, the balance really kind of lies on a greater demand for managing your workforce in the event of a downturn. So I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say it would not be impacted. I think there\u2019ll be some impact, but it will certainly be less impacted than a typical small business would be. Martin Mucci : And less impacted we are than we used to be. If you went back to the last recession and we were primarily a payroll company, I think, we feel that really half of our revenue coming from non-payroll services and moving to more than half and from non-payroll that also changes kind of the impact to us as a company in a recession area. Efrain Rivera : And one final point on that, Marty raises, which is important, when we went into the recession last time, which was in the \u201808 time frame, we were heavily dependent on float income; almost 30%, somewhere between 25% and 30% of our net income was generated by float. We\u2019re completely different company now. And I\u2019ve heard people make the argument and \u2013 hey, look I like a good argument like anyone else\u2019s, but I do think the data suggests that were different. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thanks guys. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Hi, guys. I was just looking to get a couple of clarifications. What was the revenue growth contribution of Oasis in the quarter trying to get to an organic growth number in the PEO and Insurance in the first quarter? Efrain Rivera : So, Brian, I called it out as a little less than 10%. Organic growth was between 5% and 6%. Bryan Keane : Inside of PEO and Insurance? Efrain Rivera : No, no, total revenue. We didn\u2019t split it out like that. I just caution that that if you want to know what the growth rate for PEO was in the quarter, PEO \u2013 not PEO and Insurance, it was solid double-digit. Bryan Keane : Yes. I just was trying to get there was about a $15 million gap I think in Street numbers in PEO and Insurance versus the actuals. It sounds like\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Yes. Yes, so part of that, Bryan, I called out; part of it is that at the end of the fourth quarter, we made a small classification change in staffing revenue, which some people picked up and some people did not. I would just caution that you could come back to me offline and I\u2019ll walk you through the numbers, but the starting point was a little bit different. We made that change, not everyone picked it up. So I think that\u2019s part of it. I think that\u2019s generating part of the change there. And so part of that moved into Management Solutions. That probably accounts for a good chunk of the difference. Bryan Keane : Okay, helpful. And then just on that guidance in PEO and Insurance to be toward the lower end of 11% to 14%. Is that that the workers comp will drag a little longer than you expected? Just trying to make sure I understand the change. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Workers\u2019 comp started a bit more slowly than we had anticipated in Q1. And I called out at-risk healthcare and insurance attachment rates based on what we saw in the first quarter. We are walking through all of that with now three pieces of the PEO and we think that that number is going to be a little bit lower, but I would just caution one thing about that that really doesn\u2019t have that much of an impact on margins. And then the second thing is I could come back next quarter and say, hey, the attachment rate actually ended up being a little bit higher. It\u2019s a little bit tough to nail it with precision, but we\u2019ll keep updating it. Bryan Keane : Okay, super. Got it. Thanks guys. Efrain Rivera : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas of William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : Hi guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So just to stick with Oasis, briefly, I think based on my math Oasis did maybe $85 million or so in the quarter, which I think was maybe $5 million or $6 million below last quarter. Just wondering if there\u2019s anything to highlight on the step down, if there is any seasonal factors to consider, and if that was in line with your expectations as of last earnings call? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I don\u2019t do on the spot math. I would say that our \u2013 it always was pretty much in line with our expectations. So I\u2019d have to go through that with you to make sure that you are using the right set of numbers. Andrew Nicholas : Okay, fair enough. And then with respect to the PEO market, I\u2019m just curious you\u2019ve seen any changes in the competitive landscape recently. I think more specifically I\u2019m curious about when you\u2019re going head to head with another PEO, which I recognize isn\u2019t as frequent, but when you are, what are the determining factors for winning or losing business? And relatedly, how important is pricing in those conversations and if you\u2019ve seen any changes in the pricing dynamics as well? Thank you. Martin Mucci : Yes, I really haven\u2019t seen any changes in the competitive market for PEO, and in fact, I think with Oasis and giving us some new markets, we\u2019re in some new markets, it really comes down a lot of times from a competitive standpoint. So you\u2019re not seeing something \u2013 you really I think more competitors I think it\u2019s the same competitors and we\u2019re a little bit larger obviously now at this point being the second largest, and I think it\u2019s really the insurance plans, which we feel very good about having the insurance plans and of course the service that you provide with the HR specialist. And I think we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate that we\u2019ve been in this business for a long time both PEO and ASO, and by the way, we can offer either one of them that\u2019s part of the new branding of Paychex One is the brand of our HR outsourcing. So you can go PEO, you can go ASO with us. We\u2019ve been in this business for 20 years. We have 600 HR specialists out there and we have great insurance plans and we continue to expect to have those. And that\u2019s really what it comes down to is, what\u2019s the service model, what the insurance plans that you offer, what\u2019s your history in the ability to offer that service. The competitive nature hasn\u2019t changed much. I think we\u2019re very well positioned to win in this market. Efrain Rivera : Hey, one other point to your earlier question and you can call me back offline. I would caution with saying that that revenue is sequential in PEO; certain quarters there\u2019s cyclicity in quarters. And typically in the back half of the year, you have higher revenue than the first half of the year. So it\u2019s not, preferred compare to look at it quarter-over-quarter because it bounces around now. Andrew Nicholas : No, that\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s kind of what I assume, that\u2019s why I asked. So I appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Tien- tsin Huang : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just a couple questions on the HR and the Management Solutions side that was clearly better you laid out a lot of reasons but versus your 3% to 4%. What was the difference there, another reclass maybe contribute a little bit, but can you comment on payroll HCM pricing maybe raking for. Efrain Rivera : Yes. We still would have had 5% in the absence of the re-class. So I just want to make sure that that\u2019s clear. And the other thing I want to make clear is that I did call down in Q1 due to a composition of days issue in the quarter that did hit us. So we had just stronger performance through a combination of both. As we discussed earlier, pricing, client growth, stronger mid-market performance on the sales side; the combination of all of those just ended up being stronger than we had anticipated which was a good turn for us. Tien- tsin Huang : It is. That\u2019s great. And then just on the quarterly EPS, Efrain, I think last quarter you mentioned in the first half, net income would run low single-digit growth. This came in ahead. Can you maybe help us recast second quarter versus second half, if you don\u2019t mind? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Well, I guess what I\u2019d say, Tien-tsin, as I gave a fairly good guidance on what we expected revenue was going to be in the quarter and what we thought margins were going to be. So I would say, it\u2019s implicit in what we were saying was that I give you a decent number for Q2 that we expect to Q3 and Q4 we called out operating margins being at approximately 38% for the back half of the year. So it\u2019s going to be better, and at this point, there is an element of conservatism to what we\u2019re guiding. We\u2019re still in an uncertain interest rate environment. So we want to preserve a little bit of flexibility if the Fed decides that it wants to continue to cut without altering the guidance. So back half from an EPS standpoint is going to be stronger than the first half, even though we got off to a pretty good start in the first half of the year, I should say. Tien- tsin Huang : Yes. No, for sure, I know that tax and interest played some smaller roles to there. So the last one, I think, you mentioned there, Efrain, so 38% second half margins, is there any change or and that\u2019s using that as a baseline for fiscal \u201821? Efrain Rivera : Yes. There is a big danger Tien-tsin, let me explain why. So when we did \u2013 when we adopted revenue recognition, what it had the effect that was moving a revenue stream into Q3 that had previously been spread across a number of quarters. When you do that what ends up happening is that you cyclically \u2013 cyclically, wrong word, you create a situation where Q3 is always going to be your highest margin quarter, and the reason is very simple. You simply have more revenue with no greater associated costs. All of that drops to the bottom line and you are typically seeing, although I called out 38% for the quarter, it\u2019s not going to be uniform \u2013- I\u2019m sorry, 38% for the back half, it\u2019s not going to be 38% in Q3 and Q4. Q3 will be higher than Q4. And so that\u2019s the danger. If you just take that as the run rate for margins going forward, you\u2019re kind of not taking into account the Q4 \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, Q3 is going to be a higher margin quarter now going forward. Having said all of that, we do think that that all things being equal, we think that expenses will trend down in the back half of the year and we\u2019ll have some opportunity to improve margins from where we are as we go into 2021; hard to believe, but hopefully that\u2019s helpful. Tien- tsin Huang : It is. No, I was just looking for clues as you guys are obviously going to get a little bit of benefit from some of your investments. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Wald of Morgan Stanley. Steven Wald : Hey, good morning. Maybe just following up on the margin question, if there were a couple of things or one thing that you could call out to hold you back, whether it\u2019s perpetual reinvestment or just faster than expected mix shift, like what would keep you from something like notable margin improvement starting in 2021 and how should we think about that conceptually? As you talked about like moving toward less of a payroll model more of a tech model, how should we think about the margin conceptually in that lane? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I guess, I\u2019d like to defer a better or more complete answer to the second half of the year because trends will become more evident, but if I were to point to one thing, we\u2019ve had relatively high spending and what\u2019s been kind of unusual about our performance is that we haven\u2019t taken any charges. We have made changes on the fly, we\u2019ve delivered double-digit EPS growth and we have done that all within the context of the kind of programs that we run. So we understand that as we exit the year some of that spending will decrease, we know that, we\u2019re working on that actively, and the question is how much we\u2019ll have better sense of that as we go through the second half of the year. The investments have paid off. I think that the results we\u2019re seeing reflect that and I think that all of the technology advances and improvements that Marty was mentioning are really the fruit of that accelerated investment, but you don\u2019t continue to invest at that accelerated pace. You pull some of it back down. So we anticipate as we go into \u201821, that\u2019s what you would see. Steven Wald : Got it. And then maybe just one quick follow-up, I think earlier in your comments you talked about this shift away from being sort of thought of as a traditional just payroll-driven model toward the tech offerings and all the products you guys have been rolling out, and all that makes sense. I guess, just as we think about it from a macro perspective and what we sort of seeing in your data ADPs broader macro data, are you guys prepared or of the mind that we shouldn\u2019t think of Paychex as being heavily levered to shift and implement? Martin Mucci : Well, I think certainly not as levered. It\u2019s going to have some impact, but I think as Efrain mentioned earlier in a question probably more specifically on the PEO, payroll was, especially the small business payroll was very much tied obviously to new business start-ups and losses in businesses going out of business because of a tough economy. When you\u2019re 50% or more and more of an HR time and attendance retirement etcetera, services non-payroll and not so focused on just the smallest clients. It\u2019s going to have a different impact because in a recessionary period or a down turn of employment, you\u2019re going to have a bigger need for HR, how do I retain who I have, how do I maybe lay off people, how do I make changes in cost structures. These are all from our clients perspective, there is a huge need for HR support, and other products and technology like self-service. When you think about 10 years ago, we didn\u2019t have a mobile app that had much of it on a self-service from an employee basis and we can save \u2013 we\u2019re now saving clients a lot of money and better \u2013 and giving them better productivity by saying, hey, if you want to change \u2013 if your employees want to change their address or change their deductions, etcetera, they can do it all on their phone by themselves now. They don\u2019t need to call and go through, you call us etcetera. So the dynamics of the company and the clients and what they need us for has changed pretty dramatically and I think that \u2013 and certainly that was our positioning that we started moving toward many years ago to say, hey, you can\u2019t just be a small business payroll company, you got to be an HR and a complete outsourcer to small and mid-sized businesses and that certainly is going to have much less of an impact if there is a recessionary time. Efrain Rivera : One of the other thing I would add to Marty, this is just sort of concretely in terms of what we\u2019ve seen over the last three years certainly since the end of fiscal \u201816. If you look at our financials, at the end of fiscal \u201816, about 60% of our revenue came from payroll, 40% of it was what we would have called HRS. If you look at where we\u2019re of this forecast, obviously, it depends on what model you are using, but payroll now is in the mid-40%s with everything else being 55%. That trend is something that\u2019s deliberate, not something that is happening to us. As Marty said, that is the positioning that he and the management team have adopted and the numbers bear it out and I do think that we have evolved very clearly to a tech-enabled services company that is much more HR focus than it was three years ago. Steven Wald : Alright. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin of Cowen. Bryan Bergin : Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the real-time and on-demand pay the offering rollouts that you\u2019ve. Can you comment on who may be partnering with those? I\u2019m curious if the strictly for account deposit or card offering there as well. I\u2019m just trying to the mechanics of that offering and how it rolls in your model. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Yes. Bryan, I think we\u2019ll announce that probably a little bit later as we get into the last quarter \u2013 calendar quarter of this year for the pay-on-demand and because I guess I just want to be sure we\u2019re all together on before I announce it publicly who the partner is; there certainly is a partner there that we\u2019re doing it with. And then real-time payments, it\u2019s the same thing; one of the major banks, and I would wait until we get closer into the first part of the year just to make sure that everything is from a competitive standpoint, I don\u2019t want to give out too much too early, but we have partners in both, fairly solid relationships, everything we feel is in place. I just would like to announce those more as we roll it out; one will be in the next really now we\u2019re in October next couple of months and then one will be early 2020 for real-time payments. Bryan Bergin : Okay, fair. And then just a follow-up on the Insurance Services business. The pressure from the workers\u2019 comp rate there, just your outlook on went out abates. Is it still just the moderation as you go through the second half comps? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So it\u2019s a little bit lighter in the quarter than we had planned. And so I was a little bit more cautious as we went through the year. Our expectation is that in the back half of the year, it starts to abate and then by fiscal \u201821, I keep saying that, but fiscal \u201821 we should be past. Martin Mucci : So the attachment rate is pretty solid. It\u2019s a continuation of the rates that this is \u2013 it cycles in and out, and we\u2019re just in that cycle where there is lower workers\u2019 comp rates and sales are OK. In fact, the attachment is up from last year on clients, but the rates are just lower and that driving in the revenue down and you got to kind of wait for the cycle back around. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Thank you very much. Okay, Bryan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana of Jefferies. Samad Samana : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask question about the new Paychex Solo offering and I\u2019m curious how we should think about in terms of the size of the opportunity and what maybe go-to-market model is. Is it still got of direct sales organization or is it going to be similar to maybe some of your competitors to have more of an inbound type of model for their small customers? I\u2019m just curious. Martin Mucci : Yes. I think it\u2019s going to be a little bit of both. They certainly can be referred and sold by the field sales force. We\u2019re also going after it through the web and for leads and then the direct sales \u2013 telephonic sales force will be out selling it. We think it\u2019s a big market from a sole proprietor standpoint. When you \u2013 we found is there is that need for the retirement product and of course the incorporation services, and then if you find that sole proprietor that needs payroll and we can incorporate payroll, a simple retirement product and incorporation, we think we\u2019ve got a nice market there. It\u2019s pretty new. It seems to be off to a good start, but I think we want to see it for a couple of quarters. But it has got a nice opportunity from that micro, this whole proprietor really marketplace as an offering, but it can be sold from a web lead, from telephonic sales or from the field as well. So we think we\u2019ve got it covered across the field sales forces and we think we\u2019ve got a nice tight clean product that will have some opportunity there for us. Samad Samana : Great. And then maybe a question similarly on the other end of the spectrum, I mean, the company has invested significantly in its technology and a lot of the commentary today has been focused on that. I\u2019m curious how you guys think about potentially starting to move upstream or targeting larger customers based on the technology investments that you\u2019ve made and maybe what the company\u2019s view on that is. Martin Mucci : Yes. I think our view is really that still that under 1,000 \u2013 I mean, we\u2019ll have some clients over 1,000 employees. But we focus \u2013 there is a big market and when you think about those mid-market, this 20 or 30 employees to 1,000 is a very big market that we think we\u2019re very well positioned for. Certainly, we have been from a service perspective, personal service perspective, but also from now from the technology perspective in the breadth of services in the need for those HR services have come down in size so much over the last three to four years and I think we\u2019ve been very well positioned for that. So really not looking to get into that 1,000 plus generally unless there\u2019s a specific need that we can fill there, but we think that the best value, best margin and best approach for us is to stay very focused on a kind of 1 to 1,000 and specifically how we handle under 20 and how we handle 20, 30 to 1,000 is what\u2019s really taking off from a technology API in breadth of offerings that we provide. That\u2019s where the best margin is, that\u2019s what I think we\u2019re very well positioned from our experience and product set to be successful at. Samad Samana : Great. Thanks for taking my questions and look forward to visiting the company at HR Tech today. Martin Mucci : Okay . Efrain Rivera : Thanks. We are looking forward to it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of Baird. Mark Marcon : Good morning, Efrain and Marty. I was wondering, with regards to Oasis, just how much of that end up contributing to the expenses for this quarter and how should we think about that furthering and being rationalized is as this year unfolds and going into next year. Efrain Rivera : Yes, Mark, I mean, I mean a lot of it as we call out in the in the press release is driven by Oasis, in particular, the amortization expense and operating expense associated with Oasis. You know, our \u2013 there is a lot of combination going on there, but combination of expenses, the expense growth ex Oasis would be somewhere in the 4% to 5% range. Mark Marcon : That\u2019s very helpful. And then with regards to what you\u2019re seeing from a competitive perspective and then viewing that vis-\u00e0-vis all of the technology improvements that you\u2019ve put together, what are you seeing in the 5 to 20-employee market, how should we think about that? And I\u2019m particularly interested in terms of the new initiatives that you have in terms of being online sales, online implementation that was something that you talked about during the last quarter, what are some of the early results there? Martin Mucci : Yes. They look pretty solid, Mark, particularly I\u2019d say 5 to 10, we focus very much on virtual sales or telephonic sales and in driving those leads. We were doing the 1 to 4 leads internally with telephonic sales because of the speed from lead to close and we had a lot of success as we built the teams out for that last year. We moved the 5 to 9 leads, the majority of those inside the web leads to the inside sales teams for the same reason, we\u2019re off to a good start, both on lead demand generation, the way we nurture those leads and get them to inside sales and then our handling those leads that also frees up the field sales forces to get more of the larger customers in that, let\u2019s say, under 20 in that frees that small business rep team up to do that. So we\u2019re seeing a good start to the year on that. Competitively, not seeing any big changes there we\u2019re seeing kind of the same players. I know there is one that\u2019s talking about that they\u2019ve been going down market. I haven\u2019t really \u2013 we haven\u2019t really seen an impact of that much at all. I think again the investments that we made in the technology, the reputation we have for service to that under 20 really bodes very well for us. So I think it\u2019s, we haven\u2019t seen a big change in the competitive environment and actually, we\u2019re off to a pretty good start we feel. Mark Marcon : Great. And then with regards to interest rates, obviously, the Fed has done some things, but rates are actually going is different than what they were basically targeting. When we take a look at like your incremental effective yield in terms of what you\u2019re placing now relative to what the effective you have us on the overall portfolio, how does that compare percent right now? Efrain Rivera : I think you\u2019re probably, Mark, somewhere in \u2013 boy, you asked a great question, which requires layers of layers of explanation. So I will try to summarize it. Unlike other people 45% to 50% of our portfolio is invested short term. So you get an immediate decline on the short-term part of the portfolio by whatever the Fed does. So if you\u2019re in the 1.5% range, that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting on the short-term portfolio, and then if you drop, you lose the 25 bps that \u2013 if you have a decline of 25 bps then you\u2019re going to lose immediately 25 bps, I mean, immediately, but 30 days or so. So, on the short-term portion of the portfolio, that\u2019s what happens. On the long term, it\u2019s a little bit trickier because there you\u2019re really kind of turning that portfolio over about 20% of that portfolio turns over and I think that we called out in the script. It\u2019s a little bit above our effective yield notes, a little bit above 2%. Current investment rates will depend on that frankly on the shape of the yield curve, which in some ways is anyone\u2019s guess, but I would say, now you\u2019re your 25 bps to 50 bps below where you were when you started the year. Now, I just read an article yesterday. I\u2019m sure you read the same articles I do about kind of what the Fed is anticipating doing or not doing so and I caution taking it to the bank, but that\u2019s depend indicator of where we are. And then the final thing which is the third part is we do have opportunities if we see where the yield curve \u2013 the shape of the yield curve to extend duration, right now, we said duration was about 3.1 we had flexibility to go longer if we want to, so all of those are the puts and takes. Mark Marcon : I was specifically thinking about that 20% that\u2019s rolling over. That would be incrementally invested relative to \u2013 Efrain Rivera : Yes, Yes, that\u2019s what I said. So you\u2019re probably in the 25 bps to 50 bps below. Mark Marcon : But relative to the effective yield that we\u2019re currently getting. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Right. I\u2019m sorry, yes, yes. Mark Marcon : Okay, great. And then with regards to some of these new initiatives that you\u2019re rolling out that I\u2019ll be demoing today at HR Tech, what sort of contribution do you think they\u2019re going to end up having as you start making the plans for \u201821 and how does that impact the size of the sales force? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think from \u2013 I\u2019m glad you\u2019re out there. The group is excited to demo everything at HR Tech. I think it\u2019s always with us with a number of clients we have, it\u2019s a small impact to start as we ramp up penetration rates and attachment rates. But I think it does bode well for \u201821 to get these things and see how we\u2019re growing. From a sales force perspective, I think there could be continued growth there, but I think we\u2019re also looking for continued productivity with the sales force. We have a very talented sales leadership team and sales force that is always looking to sell more products in the way we\u2019re approaching as I mentioned earlier is the power of those 3,000 plus reps selling kind of all of our products, not just the yield traditional way where we would sell payroll first and come back and we\u2019re finding much more success, whether it\u2019s the small market or the mid-market kind of coming in looking for the value, the client is looking for overall, the needs that they have and selling that completely. So we may have some continued increase in reps, as we see opportunity and there\u2019ll be also some increase inside and outside probably from a telephonic sales and field sales perspective. Mark Marcon : Great. Thanks.. Martin Mucci : Okay, Mark. Take care. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Jason Kupferberg : Hey, guys. Just wanted to follow up on the commentary around the mid-market sales, you certainly sounded bullish there. It sounds like you think that trend is sustainable. So I just wanted to get your perspective from kind of share gain standpoint if you think that this is something that\u2019s going to be continuing for a while. So it feels like historically market is maybe where you would highlight some more competitive intensity and now it sounds like you\u2019re clearly making some strides to overcome that. Martin Mucci : Yes, I think a couple of things; one, I think from a share perspective, the market has continued to grow. So the good news is while I think we certainly are doing well from a competitive close rate when we\u2019re in there, the market itself is growing. So the need for HR has continued to come down in size, so clients that were looking for different solutions at 100, 200 to 300 employees are now looking for those at 50 employees or 40 or 30 employees. So meaning full time and attendance, you just see the over-time rule just came out and changed and put more focus on over-time. Clients will be looking for more time and attendance solutions. And when you can now have the technology of wearables and geo-fencing to say, hey, if they\u2019re working remotely they\u2019re working from home or another location, you can track all that and they can do it on their watch, all those things make you very viable to even a smaller client than used to think they could afford that kind of thing. And the smaller client needs it. So the market itself is growing from an HR and full service perspective, and then I think the competitive environment really hasn\u2019t changed much. I don\u2019t \u2013 there hasn\u2019t been new competitors; different competitors have their strengths and weaknesses. And I think right now between the technology and the service model we have, I think it\u2019s a very strong, and we do feel very good about the first quarter and I think what we feel like the momentum is there for certainly the rest of the year and beyond. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. And Efrain, I think it may have been two quarters ago, you had suggested Oasis could do $335 million to $375 million in revenue in fiscal \u201820, if I\u2019ve got that right. Is that still the right range? And any thoughts on where within that range might be most likely now that you\u2019re about a third of the way through the year? Efrain Rivera : Yes, I don\u2019t recall that specific one, but I think we\u2019re in that range, Jason. The one thing I would caution is that\u2019s total, there\u2019s a few revenue streams in there that are reported not just on the PEO side; part of the classification change we made at the end of the year was one of those revenue streams and we had been reporting part of the ASO revenue that Oasis provided. It\u2019s not a huge amount, but it\u2019s part of that total. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. And then just real quick last one, buybacks uptick pretty materially this quarter. Just an update on what\u2019s left on the authorization there and any implications or ways we should interpret that in the context of what might be in your M&A pipeline? Efrain Rivera : Well. That\u2019s a good one, Jason. That\u2019s a good \u2013 that was good, I was tracking there. So, Yes, no, look, shares had crept up \u2013 that was a good one, I would say; that\u2019s a question of the day. Shares had crept up a bit and \u2013 just because it was clever, the shares it crept up a bit and we\u2019re committed to keeping our share count flat. So we thought it made sense to be a little bit more aggressive. It really has no implication whatsoever on M&A. We\u2019ve got still a lot of dry powder and we got a lot of opportunities that we\u2019re looking at. And then finally, I think we\u2019ve got about $250 million or so left on the authorization. But, look to the extent that we needed to get more, we could of course have that conversation with the Board. Jason Kupferberg : Yes. Got it. Thank you, guys Efrain Rivera : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thanks for letting me back in. Hey, not to belabor the attrition, but Marty, you go to kind of more of the tech-enabled HCM kind of the incremental disruption from switching full suite versus payroll. Does that reset the opportunity on the attrition side longer term, and is there any way to think about what a longer-term target would be with the kind of new revenue contributions? Martin Mucci : Yes. Good question. I think it does to some degree, although you still got to think about the mix of the clients. So with our mix still definitely toward the low end and with the growth of that under 20 market, that won\u2019t change too dramatically, but it certainly gives us a much better retention tool when you think about also the mobile app in the tied to employees. The services that we\u2019re selling more and more to the direct employees and how they\u2019re using that mobile app really gives us kind of a fresh start on retention. But to the degree that a large majority of our clients are still under 20 and that base is still susceptible to start-ups and turnover and that kind of thing. So can we get retention better overall, I certainly we\u2019re always looking to break records on it. I don\u2019t think it will be huge though, given the makeup of the client base. Efrain Rivera : Hey, Kevin, one build on what Marty said, so while we report client retention, your question really goes to revenue retention and revenue retention has been running in the mid-80s and so I think that as more of these products stick, you do have an opportunity even if a client retention is not materially different to have a bit better revenue retention and so certainly we would hope to see more of that. Kevin McVeigh : And that probably gets wider tend that revenue retention versus client, is that a fair way to think about, Efrain, versus history? Martin Mucci : That\u2019s correct. Yes. Kevin McVeigh : Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Operator : And that was our final question. Martin Mucci : Operator, I think that\u2019s it, right. Alright. At this point, we will close the call. If you\u2019re interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it\u2019ll be archived for approximately 30 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our first quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Martin Mucci. Please go ahead. Martin Mucci : Thank you, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex second quarter fiscal 2020 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2019. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about one month. On today\u2019s call, I will review business highlights for the second quarter, Efrain will review our second quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal 2020, and then we will open it up for your questions. Financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 reflect good progress on our key initiatives. Total revenue growth was 15% for the quarter, Management Solutions revenue grew 6% and PEO and Insurance Services revenues grew 57%, including the results from the Oasis acquisition. We have been investing significantly in the area of sales, marketing, service and technology. These investments are paying dividends as we've seen continued momentum in new sales efficiencies and operations and the introduction of new and enhanced products. Paychex has been known much more as a provider of innovative HR technology solutions than ever before. Our investments in demand generation and sales are contributing to solid growth in new sales revenue and in particular we are pleased with the strong performance of the mid market space aided by greater attachment of our broad suite of HCM, SaaS-based software solutions, such as our time and attendance and HR administration products. We are now in the main selling season. We believe we are well-positioned for continued momentum. We're also continuing to experience improved efficiencies in our operations through the use of self service functionalities and our robotic process automation efforts. By automating more routine processes, we are reducing operating costs and providing more time for more high value client service interactions with our team. The evidence of high quality service by our teams is demonstrated by our client retention and satisfaction scores which remain consistent with record high levels. We have seen continued increases in net promoter scores, most notably in the mid market space. Let me touch briefly on what we are seeing in the small business environment. The Paychex | IHS Markit Small Business Employment Watch sowed hourly earnings growth at its highest level since 2011 while job growth has been holding steady. Wage increases are beginning to reflect the tight labor market for small businesses. The constant battle for talent highlights the importance of having a partner like Paychex, who can provide solutions to simplify HR recruiting and on-boarding and a competitive benefits package to attract and retain top talent. We are currently operating in an unpredictable regulatory environment. Compliance with a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape is one of the many reasons employers choose Paychex for their HR needs. We're proud of our leadership role within the industry, partnering with regulatory agencies, keeping our clients informed and quickly updating our systems to be in compliance and support changes as they become effective. Just this month, the IRS released the final version of the new form W-4 to be used by all new employees and for all adjustments effective January 1, 2020. By remaining actively engaged with the IRS and providing feedback throughout their process, we were able to have the new forms and related calculations integrated into our systems within minutes of the issuance by the IRS. The workplace continues to evolve both in technology and the way people work. And we are very proud that Paychex has been included on the Fortune magazine's Future 50 list of companies that are best positioned for long-term growth. In addition to solid financial results, Paychex was recognized for its commitment to innovative technology offerings designed to meet the needs of the evolving workplace. We continue to focus on enhancing our product offerings, and the use of technology to remain a leader in this industry. Last quarter at HR Tech, we discussed some of the newest products being introduced. This month, we launched one of those products Pay-on-Demand, which enables workers to access wages, they have already earned before payday. This pay action is a great tool for recruitment and retention of talent, as it allows employees to be paid, when they want, allowing flexibility -- more flexibility than the traditional weekly-by-weekly or monthly pay schedule. Other companies in the industry offer similar services on a smaller scale, but our solution is unique and that it provides our clients with flexible payment options including direct deposit, pay card and digital payment into Amazon or PayPal accounts, however the client employee wants it. The other exciting products we demonstrated at HR Tech are progressing on track and will be launching in the coming months. We continue to focus on investments in emerging technologies such as wearables, real time payments, product integration, data analytics and artificial intelligence. We are proud that Paychex's commitment to tech innovation has been recognized by industry experts. We were very proud to earn Awesome New Technologies for HR award at the HR Technology Conference and Expo in October. This recognizes the enhancements and increased flexibility of our Paychex Flex service product. We were also named to the HRExaminer 2020 Watchlist for artificial intelligence and HR. This recognized our innovation using AI tools and machine learning to strengthen existing operations, our Flex Assistant chatbot currently answers over 200 commonly asked questions, spanning the Flex suite of products and seamlessly integrates with real time live chat capability with a Paychex service agent 7x24 by 365 days a year. In addition, we have intelligent tools within Flex architecture that deliver a more personalized user experience through learning individual user preferences over time that can be listing out how to do something or even watching now short videos to learn how to use the Flex product. Paychex Flex also won a Gold award for excellence in technology from Brandon Hall Group in the category of Best Advance in HR or Workforce Management Technology for small and mid-sized businesses. This is a fourth straight year that Paychex Flex has been honored with a technologies excellence award, which validates our tech vision, investment in that vision and the value tech brings to our clients. We're proud of the experience our Flex platform [technical difficulty] employees enhanced through automation we have built into the application based on individual patterns and preferences. We also continue to see increased utilization of our industry leading 5 star rated mobile app. During the quarter we experience an increase of over 50% in the number of mobile sessions and a 35% increase in the number of mobile only users. This increased mobile usage by clients and their employees has led to efficiencies internally and higher net promoter scores. We are serving clients and our employees the way they want to be served. Shifting to our PEO business. The acquisition of Oasis was the largest acquisition in our history and doubled the number of worksite employees we serve in our PEO. As with any significant acquisition, the integration efforts can cause some initial disruption in sales cadence and some operating inefficiencies as we realize the expected synergies. As we discussed last quarter, we realized some of this in the first part of this fiscal year as we went through that process. That has led to slower than anticipated revenue growth for the year. However, we believe we are in a good position now as we progress with full sales rep headcount, and our operations teams continue to focus on what's most important, that is serving our clients and providing them the right combinations of solutions to help them succeed. We are excited about the continued strong demand for PEO services in the markets that we serve. In summary, we continue to focus on growing our business by making things simple for our clients. Our innovative technology allows us to service our clients in a way that they want, when they want, and where they want. We're focused on continuing to introduce innovations to our technology-enabled service to improve business efficiency and drive even more value for our clients. Our whole suite of HR solutions has been the recipe for growth and positions us for continued growth going forward. The efforts of our employees and their commitment to our clients are definitely making a difference. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer, to review our financial results for the second quarter. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Marty, and thanks to everyone on the call. I'd like to remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements. Refer to the customary disclosures. In addition, I\u2019ll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA et cetera. Again, refer to our investor presentation, press release for reconciliation of second quarter to related GAAP measures. I'll begin by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter, and then I'll follow up with some greater detail in certain areas and wrap with the review of the fiscal 2020 outlook. As you saw, total revenue growth was 15% for the second quarter, Oasis contributed approximately a little bit less than 9% to this growth. Expenses increased 18% for the second quarter to $649 million. Similar to last quarter, increases in compensation related costs, PEO direct insurance costs, and amortization of intangible assets contributed to total expense growth. Total expense growth was primarily driven by the acquisition of Oasis. Operating income increased 11% to $342 million, operating margin was 34.5% for the second quarter and EBITDA increased 16%, and EBITDA margin was approximately 40% for the quarter. The EBITDA margin increased slightly compared to a year ago. Operating margin declined due to the amortization of intangibles associated with the Oasis acquisition as you all know. Our expense net for the second quarter of $5 million includes interest expense of approximately $8 million related to long-term borrowings. As a reminder, we borrowed $800 million bonds to fund a portion of the Oasis purchase price. Effective tax rate was 23.2% for the second quarter compared to 23.8% for the same period last year. Net income increased 10% to $259 million and adjusted net income increased 8% to $254 million. Diluted earnings per share were up 11% to $0.72 for the second quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.70. We received a little over $0.01 of benefit from stock-based comp payments during the second quarter which is included for GAAP but we excluded for our adjusted diluted EPS. Let me provide some additional color in certain areas. Total service revenue was up as I said to $971 million, 15%. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue increased 6% to $727 million and PEO and Insurance Services increased 57% to $244 million. Management Solutions revenue growth was 6%, which actually exceeded our expectations, included a contribution from Oasis of slightly less than 1%. The remaining growth was primarily driven by increases in our client bases across many of our services, along with growth in revenue per client. Revenue per client improved as a result of higher price realization and increased penetration of our suite of solutions, particularly time and attendance, retirement services and HR outsourcing, and this has been a focus of our efforts over the last several years. And if you chart our growth and revenue per client, you\u2019ve seen a pretty steady increase. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the asset value participants\u2019 funds. PEO and Insurance Services revenue growth of 57% was largely due to the acquisition of Oasis, which contributed 47% to this growth. In addition, the increase reflects growth in clients and client worksite employees across our existing PEO business. Insurance Services revenue benefited from an increase in number of health and benefit applicants, partially offset by the impact of softness in workers\u2019 compensation premiums, as we've been discussing all year. Interest on funds held for clients increased 9% for the second quarter to $20 million, primarily as a result of higher realized gain, average investment balances and interest rates. Funds held for clients average investment balances were impacted by wage inflation and increases within our base offset by changes in client base mix and timing of collections and remittances. Turning to our investment portfolio. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield now of 2.1%, average duration of 3.1 years. Our combined portfolios earned an average rate of return of 2% for the second quarter, up from 1.9% last year. Quickly looking at year-to-date results. Total revenues up 15% to $2 billion, service revenue up 15% to $1.9 billion with Management Solutions reflecting growth of 6% to $1.5 billion, PEO and Insurances reflecting growth of 57% to $491 million. Interest on funds has grown 14% to $40 million, operating income up 10% to $691 million, and net income and diluted earnings per share each increased 9% to $523 million and $1.45 per share, respectively. Adjusted net income increased 7% to $511 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.42 per share. Let me walk through, the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash, restricted cash, total corporate investments of $708 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients were $3.7 billion, compared to $3.8 billion as of the end of last year, May 31, 2019. Funds held for clients, as you know vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.7 billion for the second quarter. Total available-for-sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $39 million as of the end of the quarter, compared with $20 million as of the end of last year, May 31, 2019. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $2.6 billion as of November 30, 2019, reflecting $444 million in dividends paid and $172 million of shares repurchased during the first six months. Return on equity for the past 12 months has been a stellar 42%. Cash flows from operations were $565 million for the first six months, a robust increase of 14% from the same period last year. So, strong performance on cash flow. The increase was primarily driven by higher net income and non-cash adjustments. Increase in noncash adjustments was primarily due to higher amortization expense, largely driven by intangible assets acquired through the acquisition of Oasis. Let me talk about 2020 guidance. I remind you that our outlook is based on our current view of economic conditions continuing with no significant changes, though we have reflected the impact of the three interest rate cuts that have already occurred this fiscal year. I\u2019ll provide our current our outlook and some color on a couple of areas. We've provided updates to the guidance as you saw. Our Management Solutions revenues has been trending positively and now we anticipate it to grow in the range of 5% to 5.5%. This is raised from the previous guidance of approximately 5% growth. And we're doing well in almost all of the buckets that comprise that revenue stream. PEO and Insurance Services now expect it to grow on the range of 25% to 30%. As Marty previously mentioned, we\u2019ve got off to a slow start with Oasis slower than we anticipated. We still maintain a strong long-term outlook and continue to execute on our plans to integrate our PEO business. Interest on funds held for clients is now anticipated to grow approximately 4%, modified from a range of 4% to 8% we started the year, and this simply reflects the most recent federal funds rate cuts. And diluted earnings per share growth has been increased to a range of 9% to 10% growth, raised from our guidance of approximately 9 [technical difficulty] guidance remains unchanged. This followed total revenue 10% to 11%, operating income as a percent of total revenue approximately 36%, EBITDA margin for the full year expected to be approximately 41%, effective income tax rate expected to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%, net income adjusted -- net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are all expected to grow at approximately 9% for fiscal 2020. Now, let me provide a little color on the back half of the year. As I indicated, PEO and Insurance revenues are now anticipated to grow in the range of 25% to 30%. While the second quarter results were within the range provided 56% to 60%, we have taken a more conservative approach for the back half of the year, given our current trends. In particular, we've continued to experience a lower compensation -- lower workers\u2019 compensation insurance rate that have moderated our insurance -- moderated our insurance services growth. We anticipate that this trend will likely ease as we enter the next fiscal year. We're also seeing modestly lower at risk insurance attachment in the PEO. In addition, this change reflects impacts from the slower start from the -- at Oasis acquisition. We now anticipate that growth for the third quarter of PEO and insurance will be approximately 10%. Management Solutions guidance was increased to a range of 5% to 5.5% growth from our previous guidance of approximately 5% due to favorable trends that we've seen in the first half of fiscal 2020. This incorporates the higher than anticipated growth achieved in the second quarter and assumes that third quarter will come in the full-year range. I refer you to slide 16 in our investor presentation, which shows the impact of the re-class in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 of an immaterial amount of Oasis revenue. Please note that the as adjusted numbers on this slide represent the base on which we apply the growth rates we are guiding to in Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance revenues. And the reason I call that out is when I look at your models, two thirds of you do it that way and one third has split between third and fourth quarter. Please look at that number so that you can adjust your models correctly. Operating margins, which for the full year are anticipated to be approximately 36%, do vary quarterly. Our margins for the second quarter exceeded the guidance we provided in the last call, which was a range of 33% to 34%. That indeed was impacted by delays in hiring related to the tight labor market. We still anticipate margins of approximately 38% for the back half of the year. We expect to continue to invest significantly in sales and marketing in the back half of the year while still achieving our target of a full-year operating margin of approximately 36%. And with all that, I'll turn the clock back over to Marty. Martin Mucci : Thank you, Efrain. We\u2019ll now open the call to questions, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it. I wanted to ask about the trend and the lower workers\u2019 comp insurance rates. And I just was trying to get an idea of your visibility to how those rates trend. How do you -- what gives you confidence about those rates over time going into next year? I think, you indicated sort of becoming more favorable. What type of read do you gain on that rate? Efrain Rivera : Well, it's a couple of things. One is that because we have a insurance agency and our pricing policy is on a virtually daily basis, we get a sense of -- pretty clear sense of where that pricing is trending. That's one part. The second is it\u2019s influenced by what state workers\u2019 compensation or where they're setting up pricing. And we know we have a pretty good sense of what states are contemplating or have contemplated changes in workers\u2019 compensation insurance. So, I think the combination of those. And then, the final thing is we're looking at the mix of revenue quarter by quarter. And we know that we started the year with a strong compare and it starts to ease as we get into the back half of the year a little bit. Ramsey El-Assal: Got it. Okay. And then, could you talk about your retention trends, and the degree to which those trends are, I would imagine moving in the right direction, giving your confidence in terms of raising the Management Solutions segment guidance for the year? Martin Mucci : Yes. We're continuing to see pretty much near record levels on retention across both small and mid-sized clients. We're seeing very good retention numbers. And so, they've been very solid. And, you know how conservative we are. As we look forward, we still think they're going to -- we're going to maintain that going forward. So, we feel the value of the products obviously and along with the needs of the clients during this, particularly this kind of tight labor market, I think are really keeping retention. And we're not seeing out of businesses really increase either. So, all -- both from an environment and from our performance, I think are both keeping our retention numbers at record levels. Ramsey El-Assal: That's terrific. Thanks for taking my questions. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thanks. Hey. It seems like the organic growth, particularly in managed services is settling in at higher levels, despite much tougher comps. Can you just frame out, like how much of that is retention because Marty, I know you mentioned kind of maintaining those levels. Is it possible you kind of set a new level, based on more of the SaaS offering as opposed to the traditional service? So, maybe just a sensitivity on SaaS for service and what that can do to the retention over the course of time? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think, it certainly does. I think we're appealing to the clients the way they want to be served, as I mentioned earlier, and our employees. The employees are playing a pretty strong role these days, more than I think ever in the past. As you see the mobile app, 70% of the usage of the mobile app is the employee of the client. And so, they're having a bigger impact on retention. And we started talking about that a couple of years ago. So, I think that does have an opportunity. The issue is always still, when you see improvement, particularly on the small client basis, there are so many businesses that go out of business every year. And we've been in this a long time and it hasn't changed that dramatically. So, what I think where you do have room for improvement is certainly from a service value standpoint. I think, the need for clients, small businesses, midsized businesses to have software as a service, to have mobile apps, to have self-service available to their employees, all those things are making them more valuable and stickier, I would say to a client. So, we certainly see some -- we're optimistic, but we still also know that so many businesses start up and go out of business on the small end. Kevin McVeigh : And just to follow up on that, Marty, real quick. If it's -- if you're bumping up at that 82% level, any sense of -- how much of that is failures versus maybe other parts that are driving the attrition? Martin Mucci : I think, if you put all together, kind of no employees out of business bought or acquired. It's typically been 50% plus a little bit. So, that accounts for about half of it, and a little bit more even sometimes. And then the other pieces are price. And it's still just as competitive as it's always been, hasn't really increased. But that number has been pretty consistent and then service value kind of stuff. So, I'd say 50% to 60% of your roles, all those things together are kind of out of control type of thing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Berkley with Wolfe Research. James Berkley : Just quick question on PEO side. Would it be possible just to break out in more detail, just kind of that segment PEO and insurance separately, how bookings have been trending on the PEO side and maybe how much of the guidance drop was attributable to Oasis, which you expect to turn around? Martin Mucci : Well, let me start and I\u2019ll have Efrain jump in. I think, what we've seen there is, one, we have our -- we think the market is still very strong for PEO in particular. So, the demand continues to be strong, you're still seeing a very tight labor market. So, they're looking for help in recruiting and retaining employees, they're looking for benefit packages that will retain employees and HR kind of mobile app and strength to not only recruit, but retain in that mid market -- small and mid market. The other thing is that the integration of Oasis certainly has impacted this somewhat. We\u2019re off to a slower start. We mentioned it in the first quarter last year. We really began the active integration around June, so about six months ago. And once we started aligning underwriting procedures, sales comp models, service processes and those things, it kind of slowed our sales cadence down at Oasis. And it was definitely impacted by underwriting. We've always been very tight on the underwriting side. We wanted the processes to be very tight. And so that gave us slower ramp up for the sales. And then, we had to wrap up the sales headcount, and that was a little slower than we expected. Now, we're at that full -- near that full ramp up of the sales headcount. And also, we got through a couple of insurance renewals. It's always important to kind of see where we're coming out for the first time with a major integration like that with insurance renewals. And we came through fine. But that and the underwriting, I think, certainly impacted some existing clients. Now that all -- that we\u2019re through that, we have a much better sense of the first year of Oasis and where we're going to come out for this first fiscal year, the remainder of the first fiscal year. We think the market is very strong, our organic PEO business, non-acquisition was very strong year-to-date. And so, we feel still very strong about it. We just got off to a slower start than we thought, and that's going to impact the full year's performance. James Berkley : I guess, I\u2019d ask another way, if it's okay. If you didn't do the Oasis acquisition, would have organic PEO growth been in line with expectations, like would that have been unchanged? Martin Mucci : I think, it would have been pretty much unchanged. I mean, when you look -- we feel very, we're actually performing, sales have been stronger than we expected in our organic PEO business. And so -- yes, I think it would have been stronger. I mean, this is -- we really feel like this is kind of around the first part of the integration. And although we've had the company, we purchased the company in December, we kind of let the fiscal year play out, we had a number of things we were organizing around, running some synergies. Then in -- beginning of our fiscal year, we kind of put new processes in place. And frankly, it had a little bit stronger impact than we thought in slowing things down from a sales and even retention perspective. Now, we've kind of got that turned around and we just wanted to make sure we're conservative, kind of on the rest of the year and how that will come out. But, we feel very good about the market. And yes, it would have been stronger, if you just looked at without the integration, we certainly would have been above I think our expectations on PEO only side. James Berkley : That's great to hear and obviously doing really well on the merchant -- I mean on the Management Solution side as well. And so, just last question on that point. Just given the tight labor market, any thoughts, incremental thoughts on kind of where we are in the economic cycle? How do you think about things like labor participation rate, how much slack there might be left in that and room for you guys to run in the small business side? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think, we're still feeling pretty strongly about how the market is -- how the market outlook is. The optimism still -- it bounces around a little bit, business optimism. But, what we're seeing is the wage increases are the highest, as I said, since 2011 from small businesses under 50 employees, this is what's in that watch. And the hours worked are up also for the highest and like three years. So, we're -- we look at that as demand for the employees. So, the businesses -- the toughest thing for small -- in particular small but midsized businesses right now is, I can't find the people to finish -- to get the work done for the demand I have. That to me points to a pretty strong economy still, and that's how it feels to us. When hours worked are up and the wages are up, it's because hey, I've got the demand, and from client -- from customers that want that. So, I think that's very good. The tariffs and the trade issues, we've seen impact roughly a third, maybe 25% to a third of small businesses. Most of those are much more regional. And so, they're not going to be impacted by that. The third, 25% or third that are impacted by tariffs and so forth, have a harder time but most small businesses are not impacted by that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you. Good to see the strength in bookings in the quarter. Could you perhaps dimension the rate of growth that you have seen, Marty, both in the small business, managed solutions market and also big market? And then, you called out strength from a macro standpoint. Any additional color about which solutions are getting the most traction, where you think you might be gaining market share? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think, one retirement contains to be very strong and I think the Secure Act, most of you probably know got through the house yesterday, and it\u2019s headed for the Senate. If that gets approved, that's giving tax credits for new retirement plans and I think that would continue to be a boost for small businesses, starting retirement plans. And we continue to be just very solid on retirement services, both, what we would call large market and small market, generally are doing very well. Time and attendance, when you thinking about the overtime changes that have been recently made in providing overtime to more, it\u2019s hitting employees of our clients. Time and attendance continues to be very strong double-digit growth as well. And we're -- we tried to stay -- we really stayed I think ahead of even the market from a technology standpoint. So, it\u2019s not just the old punch cards, it's finger scan which has now gone to scan, which has gone to face scan and now wearables we\u2019ll be introducing very soon that you can punch in and punch out on your watch. And these are all things that are being demanded by clients. So, I think time and attendance, retirement, certainly HR overall and the technology that goes with that, meaning I want to see data analytics that help me as a small and midsized business compared to other businesses. We have that data base that other clients or other businesses don't have. We can use data from 600,000 plus clients that say, hey, here is what your turnover looks like compared others, here\u2019s what your wages look like. So, I think data analytics and HR and all of those things, all are pretty strong. And so, overall, we see pretty good growth. Now, we are heading in this -- we\u2019re in selling season. So, it\u2019s too early. We really need third quarter to kind of give us that look on sales. But so far year-to-date, sales have been good and particularly in the midmarket, we feel very strong about the pickup that the products have done in the marketplace. David Togut : Thank you. I appreciate all the insights. Martin Mucci : Okay, David. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Steven Wald with Morgan Stanley. Steven Wald : Hey. Good morning. So, just maybe going through the pieces of the revenue guide. I know you haven't changed the overall revenue guidance. But if I look at your adjusted numbers, I believe we talked about this after last quarter, the two different adjustments you made there and sort of map out those pieces of your segment guidance, sort of getting to 9% to 11% range on the bottom and top end of pieces added together. Is that generally how we should think about it? It sort of seems like at the midpoint you\u2019d be at the low end of your prior 10% to 11% guidance that's... Efrain Rivera : Yes. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re far off, Steven. I think that's fair. Steven Wald : Okay, cool. I just wanted to make sure I understood that. And then, because I know this caused some questions last quarter, the Oasis components, I know that you reclassified a piece of it last quarter as to how to think about it? But, I think in the press release you said it added about 1% to the Management Solutions. So, should we think about it as Oasis minus $7 million to $8 million is all in the PEO and the rest goes in the Management Solutions? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I'd have to -- I'm doing mental math really quickly. I think, it\u2019s a little bit lower, maybe $6 million to $7 million, but I'm not looking at the detail. But, I don\u2019t think that's far off. Steven Wald : Okay. Yes. I just wanted to make sure I was clear on those things. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Steven Wald : All right. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : Hi. Good morning. Andrew Nicholas : I just wanted to talk a little bit about technology in the PEO business. I was wondering if you could talk maybe about your plans for Oasis and maybe even HROI from a tech perspective. Are both businesses still running on a third party software or other plans to transition to internal proprietary software in the near to medium term? And then maybe relatedly I was just wondering if you could maybe speak to the tech capabilities of your PEO business relative to the competition? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think, the capabilities -- well, first of all, yes, they're both on third party and license software, and so far that seems to be going very well. So, we're watching that closely but we're not looking to necessarily move to any quick integration or client conversion to disrupt the base or anything like that. So, we think that the third party software is doing fine and in fact gets upgraded pretty consistently. And so, we feel good about that. The integration, we're tying it in as much as possible to our products as well. So, I think the technology that we're focused on with the HROI and Oasis is how to tie it into our retirement information -- our retirement integration, excuse me, into our retirement time and attendance and so forth so that they can benefit most from those products. And that's going well. And so, we\u2019ll determine over time whether it makes sense to get them to our PEO in house products or not I think, you never want to necessarily move clients through a conversion, if you don't have to. And if that's taken care of it, we're still continuing to watch that. It\u2019s not a focus right now. Our technology and the PEOs that we feel is very competitive. We can see, as I said, the demand is good in the street, and we're selling well particularly on the organic side. If you look kind of non-acquisition and integration, we're doing very well on the organic PEO and in fact are ahead of sales. So, I think our product is performing very well competitively in the marketplace. Efrain Rivera : Just to add a little bit more color there, Andrew. So, we run on both the Flex platform for our PEO business and we also run on a third party software, which many of you know what it is. But, it's a customized instance to that software. So, there have been a lot of upgrades and adjustments, enhancements made to that system. And I think the challenge, as Marty mentioned is with those customizations and enhancements over time we want to figure out what the right decision is in terms of bringing 411 [ph] on our internal platform and that will take a little time to sort out. Andrew Nicholas : And then, maybe sticking with the PEO space. Just wondering if you could update us on your appetite for M&A there, and maybe more broadly how you would characterize pricing in the space. And last thing there would be, does some of the slower than expected start with Oasis tied to kind of integration issues change that appetite at all? Thanks. Martin Mucci : Let me let me start at the end and go back. I think, yes, with any integration, when you update -- and remember, Oasis has had a number of companies as well. And so, we had to go across the number of companies that they had acquired as well. We want to be sure that we felt comfortable with all the underwriting processes, the sales comp models, getting tighter process on service. When we pull all that stuff together, you have some consternation that goes on and some slower ramp-up of hiring of the sales folks, et cetera. And we really think that was tied to just getting things all aligned. And we really didn't push those things until about June into the summer. And so, that put us a little bit behind this year as far as starting out. So. I think it was really geared around that. M&A, still very interested. Certainly always looking at what opportunities are there from a -- when you talk about pricing, if it's pricing of the M&A, the valuations are still I think pretty high, but it all depends. There are so many PEOs, it's such a fragmented environment. But, there is a lot of opportunity I think out there and we're just trying to make sure that we get the right valuations. From a pricing -- from the market standpoint, I think, we're extremely competitive. I don't think the competition in that market has changed very much. And I think we're very competitive and we're seeing that by being above sales of sales forecast in the first part of the year with our organic PEO. So, where there is no distractions or anything at the beginning of the first half of the year, we've seen very good sales results from our organic PEO. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : I wanted to ask a follow-up just on Oasis, just so we have the numbers right. I think, originally, the expectation was for Oasis to generate $335 million to $375 million in revenue this year. Can you just help us get a sense of what the new range would look like, obviously just given the integration challenges that you talked about? Efrain Rivera : I think, Jason, we're still in that range, but we're certainly towards the lower end of that range. Jason Kupferberg : And then, just on the sales force side of Oasis, I mean, I guess, as you went through the integration process, was there any unexpected uptick in voluntary turnover among Oasis sales people? Martin Mucci : Yes. Jason, I think, we lost a few. It was a very -- we started making changes to underwriting process and sales comp and things like that at the beginning. It was pretty minor number, but we lost a few, because at the same time, you had some PE firms buying up a couple of other small companies that were trying to attract sales reps. So, I think we lost a few. I wouldn't say it was a -- it was not a big number. And then, that put us a little behind ramping up the sales force, those numbers that we wanted, which we're back at now. So, that's a bit of what we encountered at the beginning. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. And then, just a final clarification, Efrain, just on the EPS side. I know, because there's a couple of EPSs out there. So diluted EPS, you did uptick but your adjusted EPS growth expectations are unchanged, correct? And I think that's the number you focus most? Efrain Rivera : Yes. That's correct. Yes. That's reflecting -- but we focused on both, Jason. But that's reflecting taxes. I mean, look, I get the question frequently, why do you guys call that out, I think in an effort to be transparent about what we think is underlying operating performance and what's underlying financial performance. Underlying operating performance, we exclude the impact of stock comp. Not everyone does, we do. And then, financial performance is what it is. So, that's what we're trying to be clear on. Jason Kupferberg : Yes. Okay, very helpful. Thanks, guys. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Tien- tsin Huang : The ancillary services, can you give us an update on penetration for some of those services, like time and attendance and retirement services, how much more room is there to go? Efrain Rivera : Hey, Tien-tsin. Sorry for the mispronunciation. But, for some reason, at the beginning of the question, we didn't -- you didn't come in... Martin Mucci : You cut out. Yes. Efrain Rivera : So, we didn't hear the full question, o to answer it. Could you repeat it, would you mind repeating it? Tien- tsin Huang : Yes, I'm happy to. I hope this is a little better. Just the penetration rate of some of the ancillary services like time and attendance, retirement services. I think both were called out as being positive. Where are you in that? Martin Mucci : Yes. We're definitely picking up. We don't give detailed penetration rates on those, but we definitely are picking up penetration across the base on time and attendance. Retirement continues to go up. The other thing on retirement that has been very helpful to us is in the mobile app, we've not -- we have released probably six months ago where you could sign up on the mobile app. I think I've talked about it before, as opposed to all of the paper that employees of our clients would go through. So the participation rate is up. And that's now retaining more 401(k) clients that otherwise would have dropped out because they didn't have the correct participation of their employee base. So, we're -- not only are the sales stronger, but the part -- the retention of 401(k) in retirement is stronger as well. Health and benefit insurance picking up a bit as well. Of course, we're still strong on the insurance side, and we've linked the PEO to our agency. Being a top 20 agency, we have -- if you don't qualify for underwriting in the PEO, we take you over to the insurance agency to write you, we have a very unique offering at that point by the ability to do that. So, I think all have ticked up pretty strongly. Those are certainly the best that I can think of right off hand right now. Tien- tsin Huang : Okay. Efrain Rivera : Yes. So, Tien-tsin, we only update those at year-end. But, I think just to underscore what Marty said, we're trending above where we ended last year. And if you look at it from a revenue standpoint and break out the revenue on each of those areas that were called out time and attendance, HR and retirement services, those are trending above where Management Solutions as a whole is growing. So, we're experiencing good result. And by the way, I just want to make sure that it's clear. That is our strategy. Our strategy is to approach a client and sell them on the full bundle, which is why we present the revenue in the way we do. Tien- tsin Huang : Right, yes. I know, it's been clear, you want to drive up revenue pair. [Ph] So, I get that. So, just as a quick follow-up then. And I know, Marty you mentioned -- I remember last call, you talked about improving enrollment on 401(k), what have you. So, sensitivity to AUM and asset value, given some of the move up here, I'm curious is there an update or any rule of thumb we can use? The equity market has been strong. It sounds like that that's helping you quite a bit here maybe. Martin Mucci : Yes. That's a good question. So, it's really assets under administration, Tien-tsin. We'll have to come back. It's not a huge number. So, we wouldn't anticipate a significant change. But, in the back half of the year, as we get into thinking a little bit about next year, we'll talk about it. Right now, I don't think it would be significant, unless there is something dramatic in the market, it wouldn't be significant on the order of pennies in terms of EPS. But, we'll update as we go through the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Yes. Good morning, guys. To me, it sounds like the Oasis a little bit of an integration challenge is more one-time in nature. So, I'm trying to think about what the normalized organic growth rate for Oasis might be, post one-year out? Efrain Rivera : So, when we bought them, people asked me this. They were growing kind of mid-to-upper single digits organically. That's where they were they. We expect that we will be able to bump that growth rate with additional sales people. Obviously, as Marty mentioned, we're off to a slow start there, but our expectation is we can get it growing above those rates in the future. We got to get through this year and get through the disruption of this year. Bryan Keane : Yes, guessing that the growth rate this year will be a little bit below their historical average as a result? Efrain Rivera : Yes, it will. Bryan Keane : Yes. And then, one follow-up I had on the revenue per client increase. It also sounded like you're getting a little bit of higher price realization. Just trying to figure, is that normal higher prices or is that something that you're seeing a little bit different, a little bit more pricing power than usual? Efrain Rivera : I think we had a little bit more pricing power this year than other years. I think that we do a lot of work on the analytics side to understand how to price each client. I think we've done a good job on the pricing side to do that. So, you hope every year there is opportunities to do it. Obviously, we hope to hold that kind of pricing power. But every year brings another set of challenges. Then, it also depends on competition. So, while I think the level of competitive intensity remains high, it certainly has dramatically increased. And one thing we haven't talked about Bryan, which I think is important is we're having a really good year to begin the year in our mid-market business, which also helps Management Solutions. So, a continuation of those trends in the back half of the year going into next year then has a solid, or I was going to say buoyant effect, that's a little bit too strong, but a positive effect on Management Solutions revenue. Martin Mucci : Yes. I think, the investments are really paying off that we've made in the product and the technology on the HR side of the mobile app. Those things are paying off. And as Efrain said, mid market is really coming on strong. We've had a couple of years where it was -- it wasn't as strong as we would have liked, but we're feeling this year -- certainly we're seeing this year, in the first half of the year and now we can tell you more after this quarter. But, it feels really solid about the performance there on the sales side and retention side. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Efrain, just to maybe get a little bit more color on the pricing comments you made for the payroll business, I'm wondering from a competition standpoint, have you seen a change, or are your competitors getting less aggressive or is this a strictly Paychex issue where you are able to raise prices, and maybe the competition for new business is still the same? Efrain Rivera : I think it's primarily internal. I think we have -- I think our algorithms internally get better and better every year and I think we understand more clients are okay with certain price increases and what clients are not. I think you have to be very -- do it with a great -- a lot of care. If you raise prices carelessly, you end up creating chopping behavior. I think, the other part is that there are -- I think, the strength of our model permits us to understand, because the level of customer intimacy we have permits us to understand what segments of the client base we can get better pricing out of. So, I think it's more internal than it is external. But, I think, it's important in that equation that the rest of the market is not acting irrationally from a price standpoint. Kartik Mehta : And then, Marty, just on the PEO M&A question, I know, you said obviously valuations are everywhere, but just from a Paychex standpoint, you said Oasis, you want to get this integration done, maybe it didn't go as smoothly in the beginning as you wanted. Is that slowed down maybe, M&A, would you wait a little while and get Oasis running to the point you want before you acquire another PEO, or do you think you are in a position where if an asset came up, you'd be ready to acquire it? Martin Mucci : I think, Kartik, we're very much in position. And we really feel like Oasis is in good shape now. It was really just kind of first half of the year that was -- most of the integration kind of -- just a lot of changes that we had to make that always caused some slowdown. But, I think now we're very much read. And in fact looking at a number of things today is that -- that are out there and available. And I think from a management leadership standpoint and our organization, we're very much ready. Remember how large -- Oasis was the largest private PEO in the country. So, you knew you were going to have some integration there that we had to do more, but as far as everything else from HROI, all the acquisitions we've done, we've had a very solid track record from integrating and then hitting or beating of the numbers that we expected from those acquisitions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Lisa Ellis : Hi. Good morning, guys. First one for me is on the rollout of the Pay-on-Demand products. You called out I think that you just launched one of them in the prepared remarks. But, if I recall correctly, I think you're launching two, right? One that's more targeted toward employers and one targeted at employees. Can you just give us a little more color on the exact timing and the monetization models for those two products? Thank you. Martin Mucci : Yes, certainly. So, the one we rolled out this month -- a few weeks ago, was the one for employees. That was the basically Pay-on-Demand. And as I mentioned, it's an expanded -- we think, options better than most I have out there. This is -- you can not only select when you want the money and not only put it in your bank account, but you can put it on a pay card, if you want, you can put it in your Amazon account, you can put in your PayPal account. We think this has the broadest selection of options and flexibility that we've seen in the marketplace. And we get a percentage. Obviously, we're doing that with a third party and we get a third -- a percentage of that back into the business. And we think for the most part though that the monetization of that is really in the retention of the clients and their employees that we're adding another thing to get to employees that's going to want them to stay with Paychex, stay with the mobile app, stay with the pay flexibility, et cetera, which is going to be good for the clients in a very tight labor market. In the real-time payments which is really more geared toward the clients, as you mentioned, that's geared toward the end of the first quarter of the calendar year as it consistently has. It's right on track. And we feel that we\u2019ll be one of the first to offer real-time payments. There will be a charge for that, as we've mentioned in the past, and we're still working through all of that and looking at the marketplace and so forth. But, as we get closer to rolling that out on schedule, then we can talk about the monetization of it. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. And then, second one for me. Maybe Marty, can you comment on how the new -- it looks like this -- the AB5 law impacting workers in California is going to go into effect? Can you comment just on how you see that type of law impacting Paychex and how you'd handicap your expectation that that spreads across the country? Thank you. Martin Mucci : I think, it's funny. Two years ago the gig economy was very big and expected to kind of take over employment, and then it really has kind of quieted down to a certain degree. I think those laws and similar ones will come up. I think, it's the flexibility that we want to give employees. I think, it'll be picked up by states, like you said, like California and New York, places like that first. I think, we'll be ready to handle that and I think, frankly, having a mobile approximately, having Pay-on-Demand, having flexible retirement plans, things like that, we are very well -- we're pretty well geared for that. And we're continuing to look at our product set to see how we can do things more -- even more around an employee versus an employer, which has obviously been our model for many years. So, I'd say it's still early stages, but it's still pretty early on the gig economy too that seem to be the -- it was going to be the wherewithal, it was going to be everything a few years ago, but it's quieted down. I think we were able to handle some of that now and we're continuing to look at our product set with our head of product to see what else we can do to make that easy and to be able to comply with any new employment laws that come out. Lisa Ellis : Okay, great. Yes. And I guess just to like completely clarify, I think, this law impacts like workers will be classified as like W-2 full time employees versus ones that are classified as contractors. But, you currently essentially cover or process payroll for both of those. Right? I mean, does this... Martin Mucci : Yes. Lisa Ellis : Yes. So, it was sort of mutual effect. Yes. Martin Mucci : Correct, mutual effect right now. Yes. I was thinking more of a wider look at that issue of the whole gig economy. And there is a real opportunity there. But, you're right. Yes, we cover both of those now, whether they are contractors, 1099s or W-2s, either way. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Bryan Bergin : Hi, guys. Good morning. I wanted to ask on margins. So, to maintain margin guide following a good first half year, is there a ramp in the investments absorbing this somewhat in the second half or is it a function of just getting Oasis back on the path you expected or is it more-broader than that? Can you just go into some of the moving pieces? Efrain Rivera : I think, Bryan, when you look at first half versus back -- I'm sorry, second half versus first half, the key thing that occurs is that in Q4, you have your highest margin quarter. So, you have expenses that are -- that don't ramp anymore, because now you've anniversaried Oasis. And so, expense growth is more moderate, but then revenue is higher, particularly in the third quarter where margins typically are going, approaching or above 40%. So, I think that's what drives it. That quarter is unique in terms of the amount of revenue that it has. And then, the fourth quarter also has a high revenue and expenses aren't ramping along with the revenue driving margins higher. Bryan Bergin : Okay. I wanted to follow up then also on the on-demand pay product. Can you just talk about some of the early adoption levels on the employee side? And how should we think about the funding mechanisms of these pay products and any potential impacts to the portfolio? Martin Mucci : No, it's all done through third parties. So, there won't be any impacts on our float. We're not taking any of the risk on it or anything else. We're just getting a percentage of the fees that are paid. And it's very early, Bryan, it's very early on the adoption. I mean, we've heard certainly the demand for it, but it just we rolled it out a few weeks ago. So it's really too early to say. But, there seems to be a great demand for it. And again, I think this is the most full featured from -- full flexibility from an opportunity. So, we're anxious to see how it goes. I\u2019d be able to give you a better read after the next quarter. Bryan Bergin : Okay. That's fair. Efrain, just the last one on Oasis. As you lap this acquisition over I guess part of the third quarter, anything to call out in the expected contribution of Oasis to 3Q, anything seasonal in that mix between the two segments to note here? Efrain Rivera : Nothing that's not contemplated in the guidance. Yes, nothing significant. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Samad Samana : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, the Company has mentioned mid market strength multiple times in the call this morning. I was curious if maybe you can give us an idea of what the average number of employees for new deals in the quarter looked like, just to see if it's -- how it's impacting the mix versus the historical average, closer to about 16 employees? And then, I have one follow-up question. Martin Mucci : It definitely is much larger than that. So, it would pull that mix up. We don't normally give that number out, Samad, but -- I mean it's much -- I would say, look, it's somewhere between probably 50 to 150 to give you a wide range. But. the average is somewhere under 100 kind of thing on a client ID perspective. Samad Samana : Okay, great. Martin Mucci : It's much larger than that, the 15 or 16. That's what pulls that up. Samad Samana : Yes. I guess, I was wondering more about what the overall average then would have been for this quarter, just to kind of get a sense of how much it's pulling up the overall average. Martin Mucci : Right now, it's pretty consistent. So, I don't think it's moving it enough. I think we -- I don't know if we really give that out other than annual, if that. But, it had some -- I think, it would have some adjustment, but not much, pretty consistent. Samad Samana : Okay. And then, maybe just as a follow-up as I think about the sales head count investments that you're making, is there -- the products that you guys have rolled out, as I think about the mid-market, are you also hiring reps that are more geared toward selling to that 50 to 150-employee type of customer? And should we see -- as we think about the ramping investments in the back half, should we continue to see that trend in terms of the type of sales person you're hiring as well? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think we definitely are. We're promoting some from within and from a career path standpoint and we're always excited about that. And by the way, that market goes anywhere -- I don't want to get you the sense that that's only that with that market is. That market goes anywhere from 20 -- frankly 20 or 30 employees these days to a 1,000. But, I would say, it's primarily in that 20 to 500 space, but it goes pretty broad. Yes, we're hiring people with more experience, some from competitors, some from other industries and then promoting some as well from internally. And it -- we'll continue to invest in that and we're pretty much up to full hires where we are now, but we're always looking for good people. And I think success is helping us from that standpoint, recruit as well. That always helps. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much. I know the call has been going long. I just had a quick follow-up actually for Efrain. I know you don't give a fiscal \u201821 guidance, but in terms of tax rate, is the tax rate that we're using or you're guiding for this year, is that something we should use for next year as well? Efrain Rivera : Yes, Jeff. Look, I'm going to say, right now, I don't see significant things that would change it. State taxes and stock comp expense move it, but it's probably not a bad proxy right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. David Grossman : So, each of the PEOs reported some issue in the most recent quarter, and while each was different, there was typically some element of health insurance involved. So, can you provide some context to -- in contrast to what you're experiencing and what may or may not be happening industry-wide? Martin Mucci : Yes. I guess, I\u2019d say, I don't think -- when we look at it, if you looked at retention in particular, and now we're through a couple of renewals, I would say it was a pretty fair -- I think, there is always a combination of underwriting and tightening up where we want our performance to be from a medical loss ratio. And we're pretty conservative and careful on that in what we're -- and our underwriting standards. And so, I think that had some impact on retention. But, I don't think we had any necessarily abnormal impact on the rates that we got themselves. I think, we got pretty fair renewals overall from the carriers and then we have our own self-insured plan. I think, we're performing pretty well there. And I don't think the carriers gave us anything that was that difficult. I think we just -- we have a little bit tighter underwriting standard that we wanted to put in place, or I guess tighter than what it -- at least what it was. And that had some impact on some clients. On the other hand, David, the nice thing about us is, we can take some of them over then to the insurance -- to the insurance agency and write them through the carriers as opposed to taking -- or some of the risk on ourselves. So, I don't think -- I think, in contrast, I don't think we saw anything -- I don't feel like we saw really anything that abnormal from the carriers and the renewals themselves, which bodes to me and for us I think it bodes well for the future. There was no abnormality there that should continue or anything. David Grossman : Got it. And then, just going over to the mid-market, I know that has come up several times. But, if you just had to isolate one thing that's changed most that may have impacted the momentum in that business, what do you think that is? And do you think you're gaining share or you just think you're doing a better job of retaining your clients as they migrate into that kind of mid-market category? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think the one thing is definitely the technology investment. I mean, look, we had a solid sales force and great sales leadership there and an operational and service performance, but I think the biggest change has been the technology investment over many years now. But it's really come to fruition the last few years in particular, as everything has come together, the mobile app, the HR administration, the data analytics, the artificial intelligence work, everything has come together now. We have a fully integrated solution for a mid-market that is very simple to use. And I think that is really shown in the sales performance, particularly this year, but we could start to see it the last half of last year and then the first half of this year. The sales performance is better and the retention as well. But, I really think it's the technology on top of good sales and operations leadership and performance. And just to think of it, I think, we are taking some share, but you do know -- as you know, that is a growing market for all players. And we just haven't gotten as much of our fair share in the last few years in my opinion, as we should have. And we had to get the technology really to all pulled together. We kept introducing good products, but now we pulled it together. And we also now have moved to say, hey, if you want a product integration, if you want something, if you have the best HR time and attendance that you think is better than ours, we'll build the product integration for you as well or we have the product integration already through APIs. And so, I think all of that has really helped. I think, the technology would be the number one biggest thing. David Grossman : Right. And just, can you help size it for us, or just give us some context, so that we can think about how impactful it can be to the overall growth rate? Efrain Rivera : What do you mean in terms of revenue, David? David Grossman : Yes. Efrain Rivera : Yes. So, mid-market revenue, if you look at it in terms of total payroll revenue, we give you a payroll, so I'm not giving you a number you can't figure out. It's been running about 25% or so of our overall payroll revenue. So, you can figure out Management Solutions. You know what percentage is Management Solutions. You can get a sense of that bucket within Management Solutions. So, if it accelerates, it's helpful. And I think that where it is helpful and I think there was a discussion earlier about this, if you see -- you see continued trends and over time, you see average client size go up, and that's positive, but also you have more opportunity to attach ancillaries, when you get those clients. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Mark Marcon : Just a few follow-ups, first, just on the PEO side. When you talked about the carriers and what you're doing in terms of your own self insurance -- on the healthcare cost, what rate of increase are you typically seeing as you go into next year, for a like-for-like type plan? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I think, Mark, I would say, no one is giving you the exact increase. I would say, it's pretty competitive with the market; in some cases, it's a little bit below. So, part of following up on what Marty was saying, because we try to manage the book very conservatively, we ensure that we manage those losses tightly so that we can go out to market with rates that are competitive in the market. Mark Marcon : All right. I appreciate that. And then with [Technical Difficulty] not sure if you're hearing that. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Martin Mucci : A little bit there, Mark. Go ahead. Mark Marcon : With regards to the percentage of the clients that you're selling -- what percentage of your PEO clients actually are taking your insurance where you are self insured for it? Martin Mucci : Yes. So, I'll flip it around. We don't give the exact clients. But, if you look at PEO revenue, PEO revenue includes at-risk revenue of 35% to 40% in that revenue. And you can get to that because we give you a breakout for cost. So,, that gives you a sense. We don't break it out by specific clients. Mark Marcon : Got it. And then, with regards to the mid-market, you're obviously doing really well there. In terms of the new sales, is there any change, Marty, in terms of the composition of who you're getting those new clients from or how we should think about that with regards to -- there is still some surprising number of companies out there with really old legacy systems versus some that have transitioned to newer systems? What does the composition look like in terms of the new sales that you're getting? Martin Mucci : I think, it's been a combination of taking some from competitors. And I would say -- I think, it's probably this year, I would guess, it's run 50-50 on old legacy systems going to moving into a new platform, a software-as-a-service platform of ours and really moving up the technology, and then, probably the other half is more something they didn't like from a competitive standpoint. So, I think we're taking some from market share and then some from as the market expands itself. And that's probably roughly around half and half I'd say, at least this year to-date, kind of thing. Because you know that market, it does continue to expand and it's growing across, -- the market itself is growing of those who just see the need, particularly in this tight labor market, to have something that's going to help them hire and onboard with all of that, doing it paperlessly, then retaining them with integrated benefits on a mobile app and retirement plans. And so, they're seeing a need that they have to go up that it\u2019s -- it definitely is more critical to them in a tight labor market to move on to a more modern system. And I think ours is appealing to a number of those prospects. Mark Marcon : And then, two longer-term questions. One would basically be you started off the whole presentation basically by talking about some of the effectiveness that you're seeing in terms of your sales and marketing efforts coming through and sales -- SG&A actually ended up declining as a percentage of revenue, despite the strong sales growth. So, I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the longer term implications for the increased efficacy with regards to your sales efforts and what you're seeing there. That's the first question. And then, the second question is basically, how we should think about the effective yield for next year through a float balance and through duration? Martin Mucci : Okay. Let me take the first one and then Efrain... Efrain Rivera : Yes. That's fine. Martin Mucci : I think, Mark, the interesting thing is it's a sales and marketing kind of combined look and you're seeing is -- we've talked about, I think before a shift more toward marketing, many times they -- most people are buying or making their decision, they are 70% or 75% of the way through the decision before they ever talk to anyone. And they're looking for much more online approach there, being marketed to online, the way you market to them, the way you get leads, the way you nurture leads, and then the way you sell. And we're trialing a number of things that will make us even more efficient from that standpoint where you're spending marketing dollars, because a lot of the marketing is really the sales now. We certainly still have a lot of field reps that we count on that are building relationships and getting referrals in the field and talking to clients, but particularly the smallest clients who are starting up businesses are going online and looking to look demo and even buy online and we're preparing for all of that. So, I think we're looking for efficiency, but even more so, what's the best way to market and sell to a prospect or an existing client that's in business and try to be as efficient as we can. But, it's really looking at how is that shifting from web to -- from live person to web, telephonic to e-commerce and in positioning ourselves well for the future on that. And I think, we have a pretty good handle on it and we're trialing a number of things now that seem to be successful. Mark Marcon : Great. Efrain Rivera : Hey, Mark, on the yield question, I'd say that the yield will go out this year, meaning this fiscal year is probably the yield that we have, we will plan for next year, given that apparently the Fed has decided that it wants to hold. We do have a little bit of play there in terms of float balances which have been increasing slowly. And we do have a little bit of play with duration. But for planning assumptions, that's what I would assume. Mark Marcon : Just to be clear, Efrain, the yield -- the year on is basically the year is basically what we should plan on for next year, not the average for this year? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I think, it's going be slightly lower, but I'm just saying the back of the yield we have in the back half of the year is probably -- is the yield we go into next year with\u2026 Mark Marcon : Got it. Efrain Rivera : And we have a little bit of play with duration. You saw this year -- this quarter duration was 3.1. We can extend it further, but it will depend a little bit on that or it will depend on the shape of the yield curve, how far we want to go out. Operator : We have time for one final question, and that question comes from the line of Matt O'Neill with Autonomous Research. Matt O\u2019Neill: Hi. Thanks guys for squeezing me. I know it's a long call. Most things have been asked and answered. I was just curious, has there been any noticeable evolution in the kind of lead-gen sources, maybe moving a little bit all way from the CPA channels and more towards the online channels? And sort of as a follow-up, if that's true, is that something that drives kind of more price-sensitive customers or not really any change on that side of it? Martin Mucci : No, I think, Matt, it definitely has moved some. I mean, we still rely a lot on being out in the field and building those CPA relationships. They are good partners with us as well as current clients. But definitely, as I said, a lot of -- today, everybody is doing their research online, even if you're given a referral. In the old days, you just call us and today you're going online, you're searching our website. Our investments have been in the website and then being able to demo the product, whether it's -- you can demo it right on your mobile app if you download the mobile app. And so, it has been about how do you get those leads, and we put a lot of investment in that from a marketing standpoint, as well as how do you then nurture those leads, if they're not ready. That's different than it used to be. That's a whole nurturing piece that we have put in place for the last few years now, about how to get information to clients and make sure when they're ready, they come to us. And then, we're moving to more of an -- even in e-commerce, where you can buy online particularly with SurePayroll or other options, you can buy online. That also lowers some costs. It increases marketing costs, but sales costs come down and balance a lot of that out as you're selling either online or through telephonic means. And you're giving them more tools telephonically to help demo a product to a client and then sell it to them. So, we're definitely seeing that change and I think that will ship costs from marketing -- or from sales to marketing. They become all kind of one part of cost that you look at to be the most efficient. But, it really is about how you best sell to clients, and they are definitely searching, demoing and even thinking about or buying online, and we're into that already and we're looking -- we might -- we'll find ways to expand that as well. Matt O\u2019Neill: Thanks for that. And again, happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Yes. Thanks, Matt. Operator, so, I think that's the last question. Correct? Operator : Yes. That's correct. Martin Mucci : At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it'll be archived for approximately 30 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our second quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. We appreciate it. We wish you all a happy holiday season. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Paychex Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Martin Mucci : Thank you. And thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 29, 2020. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. And this teleconference is being broadcast over the internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month. I will start today\u2019s call with an overview of how we are responding to COVID-19 and then review business highlights for the third quarter. And Efrain will review our third quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal 2020 including our current thinking and the potential impacts of COVID-19 on our business, and then we\u2019ll open it up for your questions. First and foremost, I want to address the evolving situation we are currently facing with COVID-19. Our number one priority is the safety and wellbeing of our employees and serving our clients and their employees. Our business continuity plan was implemented, and our teams are working around the clock to ensure that we take the necessary steps to ensure our employees\u2019 safety while continuing to support our clients through this unprecedented time. Early on, we instituted travel restrictions and began to reduce the number of employees working in our offices. At this time, all employees, unless designated as critical on-site person, that\u2019s less than 5%, are now working from home and our service metrics and client response time has been excellent. In fact, our average answer performance yesterday was 7 seconds. Extremely proud of this team and the work they\u2019ve done in a very-fast period of time. I\u2019m incredibly proud of how the whole leadership team and employees have responded to this situation. Because of their hard work and efforts, we\u2019ve been able to complete all of these transitions without any service disruptions. We continue to help our clients navigate the significant amount of information and changing regulations from state and federal governments including The Families First Coronavirus Response Act. Our compliance team also remains in contact with federal, state and local government authorities on a real-time basis to ensure we are aware of and offering support and ideas on any new regulations or support initiatives related to COVID-19 that could impact our clients. So, far, we\u2019ve seen minimal changes in our key metrics. However, with the expanding shutdowns of businesses throughout the nation, we do expect that this will be particularly challenging time for small and midsized businesses. This will have impact on our results, and Efrain will provide some color when he discusses our current outlook. The federal government has taken a number of steps to stabilize these issues and is considering more relief actions as we speak. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all aware of the at least handshake agreement last night. And we\u2019re working through those detail changes as we see how the vote and the presidential approval goes probably today. Small businesses in particular are in need of aid to be able to stay in business and pay their employees. The speed in which relief actions are put in place will impact the severity of the economic impacts, resulting from this virus. Last weekend, we were part of a small group that sent a letter to Congress, supporting the small business loan program to help businesses continue to pay their employees and offered our assistance as a payroll processor to do that in the most effective and timely way. We continue to monitor leading indicators to gauge the changes into the small business environment. We believe we are well-prepared to navigate our way through these uncertain times. The significant investments we\u2019ve made in our technology and in particular our mobile app, and our expanded product and features and our service model options allow us to support our clients in any environment. And as you are well aware, we maintain a strong balance sheet and cash position. We will continue to focus on our business objectives and invest in our people and our clients. This is a rapidly evolving situation, but we will keep you informed on the expected impacts as events continue to unfold. Now, I will update you on our business and financial results for the third quarter, which reflect good progress on our key initiatives. Total revenue growth was 7% for the quarter, Management Solutions revenue grew 6%, and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenues grew 10%. Through the third quarter, we have continued to see strong execution in operations with record high net promoter scores and client retention. In addition, we have had strong results in our virtual sales divisions, digital marketing efforts, and mid-market sales through the selling season. As we have discussed on previous calls this fiscal year, we had a slower start than anticipated on the integration of Oasis. We believe we have addressed these issues in sales. We are now fully staffed and have a new leadership team in place. For service, staffing levels are stabilized and the focus can now -- continues to be on servicing our clients with less need to work on integration of the clients into the platform. The business has strong fundamentals that will drive growth over the long-term and we remain very-positive about the continued strong demand for HR, insurance support and PEO services, particularly in this difficult environment. As the largest 401(k) record-keeper in the U.S., Paychex was prepared to respond to the SECURE Act, which was enacted in December of 2019. This legislation provides incentives for employers to offer retirement savings plans and provisions to improve savings for millions of Americans. With our strong expertise in retirement plans and our award-winning Retirement Services Participant Portal, we are well-positioned to assist small and midsized businesses and their employees as they navigate this new legislation and plan for retirement. We launched Pay-on-Demand in December, which improves the employee experience by offering them flexible access to wages they have already earned before payday, helping them manage their personal cash flow. This is a valuable tool for employers to help attract and retain talent. Other companies in the industry offer similar services on a smaller scale, but our solution is unique in that it provides our clients with flexible payment options including direct deposit, pay card and digital payment into Amazon or PayPal accounts. We also believe that Pay-on-Demand will see increased usage in this current environment with employers needing a more flexible workforce that will need much more flexible pay options and probably more immediate pay. We were excited to launch the first of our wearable apps as well, which we demonstrated it in October at HR Tech Paychex Time where the Apple watch was launched in January for Flex customers. This allows clients, employees the flexibility and convenience of punching in and out on your Apple watch. We also launched Paychex Flex help center, which provides dozens of training resources and how to tutorials for assistance using Flex technology from within the application itself. Help center allows customers to access help materials that are relevant and easy to consume via their individual preferred learning method, whether that is video tutorials, step-by-step instructions or chat. The latest product releases included significant enhancements to existing features, which continue to add value by making things simple for our clients and allowing users flexibility and choice. These enhancements include electronic signature capabilities in our document management tool, improved visibility into labor costs and employee data with live reports and additional integrations with some of the top HR finance time and attendance, and benefit solutions in our Paychex Integrations solution. While Paychex Flex does provide a full suite of HR solutions, the open platform allows customers the flexibility they may need to integrate with other tools, if they so choose or if they already have them and don\u2019t want to switch out of them. Products like learning management services with online training, electronic signature capabilities of document management will support the needs of clients in this time of remote workforces. Our real-time payments offering will be introduced in April. We believe we are one of the first to offer this capability to customers, and this will allow employers to pay employees faster, which can help attract talent, can also help quickly resolve any issues with payroll. Our technology roadmap continues to focus on the area of emerging technologies such as wearables, real-time payments, product integration options, data analytics and AI, all of which will play important role in helping clients in this current environment. We are proud that Paychex\u2019s commitment to technology innovation has been recognized by industry experts. Our Paychex Flex Assistant was selected as a Stevie Award winner for best use of technology in customer service. Flex Assistant answers over 250 questions, covering the breadth and depth of the Paychex payroll and HR suite. What differentiates our technology is that it seamlessly connects to a live specialist in real-time, if the user wants more assistance and the entire bot transaction is visible to that specialist. So, no repetition is needed. So, Paychex and SurePayroll also received Stevie Awards for our excellent customer service. As a critical business partner for many of our clients, we pride ourselves on doing business with integrity. It is ingrained in our corporate culture and very evident in the last few weeks as we quickly implemented our business continuity plans for our clients and employees. I\u2019m extremely proud that Paychex has once again been recognized by Ethisphere as one of the 2020, 2020 World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies, the 12th time we\u2019ve received this recognition. And in summary, as we navigate these unprecedented times, we continue to support our clients, our employees, our communities and our shareholders. We have invested heavily in making our technology solutions and service flexible and mobile, and we are more prepared than ever to handle this current environment. I would like to thank our IT, sales, service, compliance, marketing and HR teams who have worked diligently to ensure regular communication to our employees and our clients, and that all employees have the equipment they need to work remotely and stay connected with each other and our clients. Also, thank you to our employees, who have maintained diligence and flexibility during these transitions in the way we all work. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the third quarter. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Marty. Good morning. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and such involve risks. Please refer to the customary disclosures in our earnings release. In addition, I\u2019ll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share. Again, refer to the press release. Before I start, I hope that, as we speak, you all are safe and in good health. That\u2019s the most important thing at times like this. If you have loved ones who are affected by the virus and its impacts, please accept our thoughts and prayers for you and for your family. Being human at this time is the most important thing we can do. So, now let\u2019s talk finance. Let\u2019s start by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter and then follow up with some greater detail in certain areas. I\u2019ll wrap with the review of fiscal 2020 outlook and some high level commentary on fiscal 2021. Yes, some high level commentary on fiscal 2021. Stay tuned, based on preliminary looks into next fiscal year. Total revenue, as you saw, grew 7% for the third quarter to $1.1 billion. Oasis contributed attributed about 1% to this growth. Expenses increased 5% to the third quarter to $673 million. Increases in compensation costs and PEO direct insurance costs contributed to total expense growth, partially driven by the acquisition of Oasis. Op income increased 10% to $470 million; op margin was 41.1% in third quarter compared to 40.1% for the third quarter of fiscal year \u201819. EBITDA increased 8% that\u2019s $520 million; EBITDA margin was 45.6% compared to 45% for the same period last year. Very strong results. Other expense net for the quarter of $6 million includes interest expense related to long-term borrowings. Our effective income tax was 23.6% for the third quarter compared to 23.7% in the same period last year. Net income and adjusted net income for the third quarter both increase 9% to $355 million and $351 million, respectively. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share each increased 9% to $0.98 per share and $0.97 per share respectively. We received approximately $0.01 of benefit from stock-based comp payments during the third quarter, which is included for GAAP but excluded in our adjusted diluted EPS. Let me provide some additional color in selected areas. Service revenue decreased 7% for the third quarter to $1.1 billion. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue increased 6% to $850 million; PEO and Insurance Solutions increased 10% to $272 million. So, you saw through the third quarter continued strong performance on Management Solutions. This is primarily driven by increases in our client base across many of our services, along with growth in revenue per client. Revenue per client improved as a result of higher price realization, increased penetration of our suite of solutions, particularly retirement services, time and attendance, and HR outsourcing. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue growth of 10% was driven by the growth in clients across our PEO businesses. Insurance Solutions revenue benefited from an increase in the number of health and benefit applicants, partially offset, as we\u2019ve been saying all year, by the impact of softness in workers\u2019 compensation premiums. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 7% for the third quarter, primarily as a result of lower interest rates earned partially offset by higher average interest -- investment balances, I should say, and realized gains. Funds held for clients average investment balances were impacted by wage inflation and increases within our client base, offset by changes in client base mix and timing of collections and remittances. These results obviously do not include the impact of 2 March rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Turning to our investment portfolio. We continue to invest in high-quality credit securities. Long-term portfolios have an average yield of about 2.1% and average duration of 3.1 years. Combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.8% for the third quarter, down from 2% last year. Now, year-to-date. Total revenue increased 12% to $3.1 billion, service revenue increased 12% with Management Solutions reflecting growth of 6% to $2.3 billion and POE and Insurance Solutions reflecting growth of 36% to $763 million. Oasis contributed approximately 28% to the growth. Interest on funds held for clients, grew 6% to $62 million. Operating income increased 10% to $1.2 billion. Net income and diluted earnings per share each increased 9% to $877 million and $2.43 per share respectively. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 8% to $863 million and $2.39 per share respectively. Let me talk about our financial position, which I think is really, really important in a time like this. It remains obviously very, very strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $930 million as of February 29, 2020. Funds held for clients as of February 29, 2020 was $4.4 billion compared to $3.8 billion as of May 31. Funds held for clients, as you know, vary widely on a day to day basis and averaged $4.5 billion for the third quarter. Total available for sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $84 million as of February 29, 2020 compared with $20 million as of May 31, 2019, and as interest rates oscillate, that number changes very, very significantly. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $2.8 billion as of February 29, reflecting $667 million in dividends paid and $172 million of shares repurchased during the first nine months. Our return on equity in the past 12 months was a very robust 42%. Cash flows from operations were $1.1 billion for the first nine months and increased 3% over the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher net income offset by timing fluctuations and working capital. Let me just summarize our financial position because it\u2019s very, as I said, important. We are very solid with our cash position is strong. We have $900 million in cash. We have an undrawn revolver. We have the highest cash generation of our peer group. We have the highest dividend. And we have confidence that we will weather the storm for both, our clients, our employees and our shareholders. Now, I turn to guidance for the current fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. First, I want to provide context. As you know, there are new events unfolding daily and we\u2019re constantly incorporating this information. Our guidance reflects our assumptions as of today, based on the information that we have regarding potential effects on the business. This guidance also reflects the impact of 150 basis points of interest rate cuts that have occurred in March. Our guidance for the full year of fiscal 2020, as you saw in the press release now, is that we anticipate management solutions to grow approximately 4%; PEO now about 24% for the full year; interest on funds held for clients is anticipated now to decline in the range of 2% to 3%; and total revenue is now anticipated to grow in the range of 8% to 9%. Op income as a percent of total revenue is anticipated to be approximately 36%, EBITDA margin for the full year 2020 is expected to be approximately 41%, other expense net is expected to be in the range of $22 million to $24 million, and the effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23.5% to 24%. Net income and diluted earnings per share growth are now anticipated to increase approximately 7% and adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to grow approximately 6%. For the fourth quarter, as you can do it when you plug in your models, you can see that the guidance implies, we are anticipating the total revenue will decrease modestly and operating margins will be approximately 32%. We monitor a variety of leading internal business indicators to drive this estimate. Let me just provide some thought on that. And then, I\u2019m going to talk about next year. So, we look at leading indicators. And as I\u2019m sitting here, I have a 42-page document from our data analytics group that tells me a lot of stuff about what\u2019s going on in the business. Not everything can forecast all of the future, but we see what\u2019s happening in real time. We, through the middle of March, were not seeing significant impacts. Marty mentioned earlier that we were monitoring key metrics, didn\u2019t really see significant drops. And then, towards the last -- the second half of March, we started to see the impacts on the business roll through. We\u2019ve incorporated as much of that into the guidance in fourth quarter as we can. We think we have a reasonably good handle on what\u2019s going on. But to also temper that with experience of both what happened in 9/11, because that was an endogenous shock that was more short-lived. And then, you also balance that against the \u201808, \u201809 recession. So, all of those ideas are part of the information we\u2019re triangulating to get not only the fourth quarter but to the year that -- the next year, which I\u2019ll talk about in a second. It is for many of you, as you know, it says though we are, on the LIE [ph] expressway on our way to the beaches. And you know, there is -- the traffic is flowing smoothly, but you know, there\u2019s a stop ahead. What you don\u2019t know is those of us who\u2019ve been caught there, whether it\u2019s a two-hour stop, a three-hour stop or something longer. And so, we know a stop is coming. We expect that impacts will be felt in April and May for the remainder of this year. We\u2019ve estimated them as best we can. But circumstances can change, especially as more states decide to go on full lockdown. So, with that analogy and with the caveats that I just am about to mention, let me talk about next year. We typically give at least a preview of where we expect next year to be. And, we won\u2019t bailout and say it\u2019s too early to say anything. We know some things and we\u2019ll give -- we\u2019ll tell you what we know. We will give guidance during our fiscal 2020 in the fourth quarter call in June. So, our intent is to provide you with guidance that\u2019s more complete then. But, let me tell you about our thought process based on everything that we\u2019re monitoring. And again, we\u2019re early on in the process and subject to change. By the way, shut out to Accenture. They went first. They said what they could. And obviously, circumstances have changed. I\u2019m certain that when others report later, circumstances will have changed. They\u2019ll be in possession of better information, but this is what we have at this point. We\u2019ll share it with you. So, based on the leading indicators that we have and then based on modeling on the impacts of the business in other business contractions on a very preliminary basis, our thought process is that total revenue is going to be flattish to down low single digits for fiscal 2021. This scenario, remember, includes the impact of the most recent cuts to interest rates. And so that will impact total revenue growth next year. We\u2019re anticipating at this point that that impact will be somewhere in the range of about $20 million off of where we end this year. That part we have some understanding of. But obviously if the Fed decides to go negative, we\u2019ll have a conversation to that -- about that. Looking very preliminary, we would anticipate that operating margins will be somewhere in the range of about 35%. We would obviously manage the business to that and our tax rate for discrete items will remain consistent with fiscal year \u201820. And I just can\u2019t emphasize enough that this is preliminary subject to change. At this point, the scenario that we see unfolding is significant impact in Q1 followed by some improvement in Q2, moderate improvement through Q3 and then more of a recovery in Q4. That is consistent with the shock that we saw when we went through 9/11. We continue to update our information every day, literally. And I wanted to give you at least an understanding of how our thought process is going at this point. So, with that, I will turn it back to Marty. One thing I would say is we want -- I get a lot of questions, at the end, why don\u2019t you guys just stop taking questions at certain point. We will not do that. We will answer every single question we got. The only issue I would ask is that you keep them brief and focused. If someone\u2019s asked the question before, unless you need clarification on it, please -- please don\u2019t repeat the question, so everyone can have a chance to talk before our voices give out. So, with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Marty. Martin Mucci : Great. Thank you. Lisa, if you could now open the call to questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: ....question and for taking a stab at guidance in a really difficult environment. We appreciate that. I wonder if you could go into a little bit more detail in terms of the expense levers and the different levers you have in your business to sort of manage -- to protect the bottom-line in adverse scenarios. What do you have that you can kind of dial that you have -- that you can crank to kind of get ready to get to? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So, like most service businesses, 65% of your costs are people costs and 35% are variable. We obviously will go right after as much variable costs as we can. And then, we\u2019ll look at where there are other opportunities. I think that\u2019s the order in which we\u2019ll do it. Martin Mucci : Yes. I think with the changes, when you look back to the financial crisis of \u201808,\u201909, we were very quick to react there and yet keep full employment of the people that we had. Given some of the turnover that we have and so forth, I think we have a pretty flexible ability to keep a focus on the margins, as we always have as Efrain said. We\u2019ve always led by far the industry in margins and we certainly keep a close eye on that. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And my second one is on the PEO and Insurance segment in the quarter. Can you parse out what growth would have been there without the Oasis stub? And then, just more broadly, in the insurance part of your business, can you talk about sort of risk management strategies in the context of the environment we\u2019re in? And I\u2019ll hop back in the queue after that. Efrain Rivera : Okay. So, I\u2019m going to ask you to repeat the second question to clarify what you\u2019re asking. But, because I think the way you asked it, I can answer it in a variety of different ways. But, if you look at PEO and Insurance -- I am sorry, the PEO business, we would have grown about mid single digits, I\u2019d say in the PEO business in the third quarter. The second question, I didn\u2019t get. Ramsey El-Assal: It was just basically in terms of the insurance part of the business, maybe I\u2019ll rephrase the question, just sort of ask it as, how do you see that business sort of -- have you seen preliminary signs in that business of any type of deterioration in terms of leading indicators? And how do you go about managing risk in that side of the business throughout a downturn? Maybe I\u2019d leave it to you to answer it as you would. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Let me just explain why I\u2019m pausing. So, PEO and Insurance, I\u2019ve mentioned this to many of you, is both the brokered insurance business, which is roughly, call it 18% to 20% of revenues in that category and the PEO business. So, that causes sometimes confusion when people look at it. On the brokered business, we bear no risk. So, the short answer to your question, which I don\u2019t think is what you\u2019re asking, is that it really doesn\u2019t have much of an impact. The softness in the insurance I keep calling out is really the softness in the workers\u2019 comp insurance portion of the brokered business, not in the PEO. I think, what you\u2019re asking is, if I understand the question is, how are we monitoring the at-risk portion of the insurance in the PEO? I think that\u2019s the issue. So, the short answer to that is that it\u2019s predominantly in the state of Florida. That\u2019s one. So, number two, we look at medical loss ratios. And they have been running very favorable. And the third, which requires a much more understanding of the way we operate the PEO, we don\u2019t anticipate that we will make insurance -- make a profit on the insurance portion of the at-risk, particularly health insurance. What that means is that we are very cautious and very conservative in the amount of reserves that we provide. So, the short answer to your question is that we\u2019ve stress tested that population, which again is primarily in the state of Florida within -- by the way, just if you want to know, the average age of that population of worksite employees is about 38. What would happen, if the medical loss ratio increased by 10%, which would be significant, we are still in good shape from a reserve standpoint. So, the short answer is, we\u2019re constantly monitoring our medical loss ratios in that population. We adjust reserves as we think appropriate, based on the experience we\u2019re having. And at this stage, we feel we\u2019re in pretty good shape. If you are relying on that portion of your portfolio to generate profits, you put yourself in a more complicated situation because your reserves may be lower than you need, at this point in time. So, that\u2019s my explanation. Martin Mucci : Yes. I think, the only thing I\u2019d add to that is -- any initial view on the PEO side is actually very active on the HR and insurance side. So, -- and we\u2019ve done I think a very good job, on the diligence, the underwriting, and that\u2019s going to certainly continue. And so, we haven\u2019t seen any uptick in claims. And Efrain said how well we manage that and are very tight on that to begin with. But, we\u2019ve actually seen a lot of interest on the HR side obviously with the complexity of the regulations that are coming out, both the PEO and ASO part of our business. Our HR outsourcing, we\u2019re the only one with 600-plus HR specialists around the country that are handling these clients. And it is -- the interest has grown very quickly. So, initial pieces, there\u2019s going to be a lot of need for the HR support, not only at the beginning of this, in case I have to shut down temporarily, et cetera, but how do I handle the support payments, how do I handle small business loans, how do I with payroll taxes, all of those things. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thank you so much. And thanks for taking a shot at 2021, obviously in a fluid environment. Hey, Efrain or Marty, just a couple of thoughts on kind of the semantics?. How -- because obviously it feels like it just -- the shock is much more abrupt. Is there any way to think about as somebody gets furloughed versus laid off, how that impacts kind of the business model that? That was my first one. And then just what type of unemployment rate are you assuming in that 2021, if there\u2019s any thoughts around that? Martin Mucci : Yes. Let me start on the first one. I think it is really important. Right now, we\u2019re able -- with our new flex technology, we\u2019re able to actually survey clients who are in our app. And we\u2019ve had tremendous response just in the last four days asking them what\u2019s the impact to them. And we\u2019re seeing that the vast majority of small businesses and midsized businesses is the fact that, hey, I -- about -- over 50% have had minimal impact at this point, and then another 40% have basically furloughed. So, our hope and our word tracks from our payroll specialists on the service side, our sales people are, hey, if you can stay in business and keep somehow either furlough or keep paying your employees if you can, there\u2019s going to be support -- certainly, it looks like there\u2019s going to be help coming, whether it\u2019d be the small business loan project. That\u2019s why we push also to offer our assistance. We have all the information. We know the direct deposit accounts in the bank. We could quickly continue to help our clients pay their employees, six weeks, eight weeks, whatever the government wants to do, and then, just take that money from a government loan fund versus the client. And I think that\u2019s the quickest way to keep these businesses in business. So, it is really important. And I\u2019m seeing right now, at least leading indicator is that small businesses are trying to hold it together, maybe layoff or furlough a few people, but maintain their business model, so, that kind of depending on how long this is going to go. And if it doesn\u2019t go too long, they\u2019ll be able to bounce back. Remember, just two weeks ago, we had full employment, and it was -- the biggest challenge for small businesses was finding people to fulfill the demand. I don\u2019t think that the demand in many places will actually change. And I think it\u2019ll bounce -- I think it\u2019ll bounce back fairly quickly. People are going to want to get out, they\u2019re going to want to get back to restaurants and use services, may do it a little bit differently in how they stand close to people. But I think they still want to get out and use services. And so, these small businesses are trying to hold on to their employees, and that\u2019s going to make a big difference in how many clients are lost and how many checks we\u2019re cutting. Efrain Rivera : Hey. The second question, Kevin. So, let me just say broadly, many of our clients -- if you look at our -- on the payroll side -- I\u2019m sorry, Management Solutions side and you ask yourself, when you look at our revenue, how much of it is based on PEPM model, what the percentage of revenue is PEPM versus subscription. In our case, and there\u2019s certain -- there\u2019s a general rule of thumb is about a third is PEPM and two thirds is subscription. We assume that in the next several months, the drop in pays per control will become -- will be severe, will be pretty significant, I should say. I don\u2019t know severe -- I know you\u2019re asking the question that everyone is, unemployment probably go to 20% to 25%. I don\u2019t have a good crystal ball as -- and no one else does. But I can tell you that the way we\u2019ve modeled it, we see some significant contraction coming in the upcoming months. We\u2019ll see how long it lasts. We\u2019ve done the modeling and think we\u2019ve got at least a reasonable handle on it. So, I would say significant over the next several months. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Hi, guys. I just want to ask about a bridge maybe going from the 6 or so percent organic growth level that we\u2019re at today, down to the slightly negative growth in the fourth quarter, and then for next year. Just thinking about what\u2019s in those assumptions, including bankruptcies and other things that drives it to those levels? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Our assumption is that there will be client losses in the base that there will be -- that will be lowered pays per control. And we\u2019ve modeled it based on what we\u2019ve seen in prior recessions. And then, we got to figure out, my bad LIE analogy is just simply to figure out what\u2019s the duration of the traffic jam until that resolves. Then, the question is what\u2019s sharp rebound -- how sharp the rebound is? And we think it ends up coming back towards the end of the year. Bryan, I can\u2019t give you a bridge that says, it\u2019s 6% this, 3% that because frankly, the modeling is early on that. All I can say is that we\u2019ve looked at the client base, stressed it, assumed certain impacts, particularly for some of our payroll client base. Compare that against what we saw in previous recessions and come up with our best estimate. But we do anticipate that there obviously is going to be an impact to the client base and there\u2019s going to be an impact on pays per control. And I would just caveat it with one thing which Marty said earlier. To the extent that the downturn is severe but more a short duration, then our assumptions start to change. And to the extent that the downturn is both severe, short term and the government stimulus, which they\u2019re working through now, helps to keep some of those businesses in place. It also helps, our projections. Don\u2019t have any way yet of being able to figure all of that out. We\u2019ll see in the upcoming days what it looks like. That could have, and I emphasize could have some impact, but it\u2019s too early to tell. Martin Mucci : And then, of course, Efrain you mentioned the interest rate changes is in that as well. That\u2019s a more of a known item. Bryan Keane : Yes. I was going to ask that as my follow-up is how did you account for the stimulus? You\u2019re doing a lot for SMBs to try to prop them up and keep them alive. So, is that modeled in as well or do you just model in as if there would be no stimulus? Martin Mucci : I think, it was pretty high level. Bryan, we modeled some -- I think, we\u2019re trying to be a little more conservative on who would go out of business and on the checks because of that. But it was pretty -- it\u2019s pretty high level. And you didn\u2019t know where the stimulus is going to be and how long it\u2019s going to take. I think, the thing it\u2019s so important that we try to get across, I think the government\u2019s taken some great steps very quickly. This one could go faster, if you do use someone like the payroll processors, I think could be very quick, or if you have to go through a loan program, it could take weeks. Those weeks are very important to how this happens, I think to keep people employed and being paid in businesses in session. So, I\u2019m very hopeful that they will do something faster and because of the way they\u2019ve done it already and if that keeps these businesses running. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you. I appreciate the preliminary 2021 outlook. Could you dimension for us your revenue exposure to some of the most affected industries, like restaurants, just broadly foodservice, so we can think through 2021, in terms of the framework that you gave? Martin Mucci : Yes. Let me start and then Efrain can jump. I think, definitely -- I\u2019d say restaurants in general in those groups are probably around 5% or 6% of our base. And so, it\u2019s not as big as some might expect. So, I think, that\u2019s going to be helpful. And, those are the industries that you\u2019re seeing obviously the most impact in someplace like New York state and other states that shut down the restaurants completely. It also depends, as Efrain has said a couple of times, how long does that happen as we try to start to open those back up in a few weeks with even the partial, with a 50% rule or something else, how long do you -- how long do you keep them in business? But, I think it\u2019s around that number roughly on a client base. Efrain Rivera : Yes. You know David, so there\u2019s been a fair amount of talk about how this endogenous shock is affecting industries. Marty\u2019s right that if you look at essentially hospitality and foodservices, that\u2019s about 6% of our client base. So, obviously, that\u2019s impacted pretty significantly, both on the payroll side and on the PEO side, but it\u2019s 6%. If you look at everything else, for example, oil and gas is 1% and everything else is distributed in a distribution that looks pretty similar to what the broad economy looks like. So, we don\u2019t have significant exposures to one industry or the other on our payroll client base. Martin Mucci : Yes. One of the real positives, as Efrain mentioned about our model and our financial strength is we don\u2019t have any direct -- any large percentage in one industry, ZIP code or region. And so that allows us a lot more diversity across the base, the type of businesses and so forth. David Togut : Understood. Just a quick final question. You noted that the business really started to experience impacts in the second half of this month versus the first half. Can you share your -- what you saw in the second half in terms of quantifying the impact on KPIs? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So, what we saw was -- I was looking at, we were looking at, people running payroll and we weren\u2019t seeing the impacts. And it looked like clients to us were either staying at current -- with their processing routine or in some cases, they were accelerating their processing because they were in the process of either downsizing or in some cases closing. But, that didn\u2019t give us enough data. So, we went back into the other data that we had on time and attendance systems. We triangulated time and attendance systems, we triangulated marketing leads, sales activity, and we saw a significant drop starting as the rollout of state closures or state lockdowns accelerated. So that\u2019s where we saw the impact. Now, the good thing about that is that that we can see what the impact is and we can see the change in the demand environment. The question is, how quickly we come up out of that. Obviously, New York is not going to come out of that quickly. Question is what other -- what happens with other states that have gone into that place? Martin Mucci : Yes. One of the interesting things is while we\u2019ve seen leads drop off on the front end, but then there\u2019s been other pieces that have picked up. So, they\u2019re definitely down, but they\u2019re not like shutdown. They\u2019re down double digits, but not as much as you might have even thought. So, people still looking for and maybe because of this looking for payroll support, HR support, insurance, those kinds of things. So, they\u2019re also finding that frankly, this is the time that they better go with an outsourcer and that they would want to go with somebody who\u2019s national and has the support and service teams that we have that are desegregated across the entire country and that can provide great answer performance and support even with 15,000 people working from home. So, I think there\u2019s some benefits to the strength of who we are in our experience level at this point in time. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Steven Wald with Morgan Stanley. Steven Wald : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And I appreciate you trying to provide as much guidance as we can here. Just maybe following up on some of the comments that you just mentioned about this down double digit on the lead, but things aren\u2019t completely frozen. As we think about the developing competitive environment as we go through the trough and come out of this, how are you guys thinking about positioning that? Obviously you made a lot of investments on the Oasis side to get that fully staffed up from the sales side, but when we think about things like waiving fees right now to offset pressure the clients may be receiving or the fact that you may have some pricing competition from the very crowded market. How are you guys thinking about that over the next 12 months? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think, it\u2019s a lot more about are you positioned to help the clients through this difficult time. That\u2019s what they\u2019re looking for. Some clients are going to be looking for, hey, can you do something to help me in the short term on price? But, our price is frankly as a cost to small business or midsized business is not that big compared to the other things that they\u2019re concerned about. What we are finding is our strength in telesales for example is making a big difference. So, we\u2019ve been selling telephonically for some time, generating leads that are then picked up and handled telephonically with the conversation, the demo and the sale all being done over the phone and even to some degree, when you look at your payroll online, all by the client and self service mode. We\u2019ve retrained and added training to the field sales force on handling those calls remotely. So, being able to talk to clients that don\u2019t to meet in person, but to do that over the phone to be able to demo the product, and sell and complete the sale. And of course, with some of the features that we have with document management we\u2019ve had for some time, everything can be done electronically, electronic signatures, moving the documents back and forth, and of course, electronically on-boarding someone to start them up. Frankly, it is matter of a few hours. So, I think what we\u2019re focusing on is, all right, all of our marketing and so forth is how we can help you through this. Here\u2019s the service model we can give you. Here\u2019s the product and feature set that can help you when you think of how strong our mobile app is. We\u2019re seeing increases in mobile app utilization. Because now clients are -- many clients, employees are remote and they\u2019re able to use the mobile app. The investments that we made are really paying off from that standpoint of mobile app, learning management on site, they can give trainings to their employees online. Of course, direct deposit pay on demand can help them with their only part time or they\u2019re in short shifts when they need cash. So, we\u2019re positioning this as more of the value that we\u2019re providing. And then, if there\u2019s something that comes up specifically, we\u2019ll talk to the client, but it\u2019s not been as much about price as it is, hey, are you the full service provider that can help me through this period of time versus someone else that I have that\u2019s not as experienced and not as strong financially. Steven Wald : And then, just maybe a quick sort of two-parter. I know Efrain you mentioned 42-page report you have, sort of running through how to think about this. If we go back to the prior downturn, I believe retention rates dropped towards the mid-to-high-70s. How are we thinking about that relative to the great financial crisis? But also somebody asked previously about the exposure to industries and how you\u2019re thinking about it versus prior downturns. But, if cross section it and say, a restaurant in the Permian Basin that\u2019s more than just being exposed to oil and gas, how are you guys thinking about this? Efrain Rivera : So, good question, Steven. And I would say, we\u2019ll go into more detailed analysis of that type as we\u2019re going through the plan process. We\u2019re right in the middle of it right now. So, we\u2019ll do more work in that way. And by the way, the analysis we have looks at exactly those kinds of things. But, coming back to your question, when we in previous downturns -- and now I\u2019m going to go back \u201808 or \u201809, we started from a retention place that was lower than or -- yes, it was lower than where it is now. If we would have continued on the same track we were on through the third quarter, we would have had record retention. I mean, we were aiming towards really, really significantly -- significant improvement in retention through the third quarter. And if you would have said to me when I started nine years ago that we would hit that number, I would\u2019ve been surprised, because we were typically in the high 70s. So, we start from a good place. So that\u2019s the first part. But you have to stress it based on the change that you saw in different environments. And we\u2019ve taken our best estimate at what that will be. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now. Looking at it versus the modeling of -- or the actual experience of previous recessions, I think, we\u2019ve got a good handle on dimensioning the range, and then we can overlay what will happen by industry. But, to Marty\u2019s point, I think there is a -- there was a -- there is an assumption that we\u2019re very exposed to restaurants. So, we certainly have a certain amount of those in the base. But, it\u2019s not all of the clients that we service by a long shot. Now, I will say that that\u2019s for payroll. It\u2019s a little bit different for PEO. Martin Mucci : Yes. Steven, I guess I\u2019d just say, it is so determined on what Efrain said about the length of how long this goes and then is the stimulus package going to help them through the first couple of months. And then, does it go another two months, three months or so forth. With the financial crisis, it went a longer, certainly I think seven quarters or so. And so, if there is something that can hold them on and they can still get business, even if it\u2019s takeout and they can furlough a few people but give support on their payroll, it could make a huge difference. So, we\u2019ve done some initial modeling. But, we really need to see kind of how the next couple of weeks even play out. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Hey Efrain and Marty. Hey Efrain. Thanks for at least trying to put together some kind of FY21 guidance. And I\u2019m wondering if you could just give some -- the assumptions you\u2019re making on pays per control or retention, some of the metrics that you usually talk about, to get an idea of what the backdrop is for your FY21 guidance? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Kartik, I can\u2019t get too specific about that at this point. But, I would say that with -- generally, I\u2019ll give you a kind of a framework that we\u2019re modeling drops and pays per control consistent with some of the effects that we saw in the previous two contractions. So, we\u2019re using that as a guide for what, at least the next three, four or so months look like. And as I said, I think we\u2019re going to have severe impacts, absent whatever the buffer that the stimulus provides through the -- certainly through the summer into the early fall. So, that\u2019s one. And then, in terms of clients, we\u2019ve used that data as a reference point for how we\u2019re trying to think about or create a framework for next year. I think, many of you have that data, understand what I\u2019m referring to when I say that. So, we\u2019ve incorporated that. And obviously we need to have a framework as we go into next year. So, that\u2019s -- I would say, at a general level, that\u2019s what we\u2019re using. Kartik Mehta : And then, Efrain, at the beginning, you and Marty talked about the balance sheet. I think, the one benefit you have is you have an excellent balance sheet. And I\u2019m wondering your thoughts on share repurchase. Would you -- do you feel comfortable enough that you would want to go back when it\u2019s appropriate in the market to buy back shares, or are you at this point or want to wait and see how things progress for the next couple of quarters before you would want to go in the market and buy back shares? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Kartik, so, one of the things that\u2019s challenging in an environment like this is, in the absence of any other concerns, you would think that now is the time to start getting very constructive on share repurchase. Because we obviously think that the business will bounce back. And we\u2019re highly confident that that\u2019s going to occur. So, that\u2019s the one side of the thought process. And I would say, by the way, this also -- my thought -- the thought\u2019s I\u2019m expressing also apply to the portfolio. But, you have to -- and I\u2019ve been through this before, where we had an endogenous shock in my prior life. You have to worry about making sure that there are absolutely no questions about your liquidity, and I mean absolutely. People depend on the dividend in this company. We protect that and don\u2019t want anyone to think that there is an issue there. And so, shorter term, until you have a very clear perspective on where you are, you protect liquidity in the short term, you ensure that capital markets are functioning the way they should, and then you make decisions. So, there are those considerations that we play through. And I would say right now, we are ensuring that there are no issues on that, not that would be given our cash flow generation. But it also, Kartik, extends to things like extending the duration of the portfolio in order to get more yield. Right now, we are not assuming that we\u2019re going to do that because at this stage of the equation, we put a premium on liquidity, not that we have any issues with that. I just would -- just reiterate, we have undrawn revolver. We have almost $1 billion worth of cash. And so, there\u2019s no issues there. But, you got to balance all of those pieces in terms of before you start thinking about getting constructed on share repurchase. There may be a time, we\u2019ll talk with the Board at the appropriate time and have that conversation probably. It\u2019s not now. Kartik Mehta : And then, just one last question, Marty. Marty, when you looked at the previous recessions, was there -- when we came out of it, did you see more small businesses wanting to go with an outsource provider, either because of what happened or they\u2019re looking to save money? So, in another words, as we come out of this, could you see maybe an acceleration in sales because you have businesses that are not using outsourced services wanting to use the service? Martin Mucci : I don\u2019t think we saw -- I don\u2019t remember seeing that much of it, Kartik, at that point. But, there\u2019s a couple of things that are very different in this shock that I think can help. One is, the government stimulus packages and the regulation changes are very complex. And I think, more businesses will say, if I\u2019m going to take advantage of that, I\u2019m going to start my business or reignite my business and take advantage of some of the things that are out there. I cannot follow that. I need outside support. And so, I think that\u2019s going to help more businesses say, if I haven\u2019t outsourced before or if I\u2019ve outsourced to a small provider that can\u2019t provide that kind of guidance like we can, hey, I\u2019m going to go with -- I\u2019m going to go with somebody. Second, it\u2019s so different from a technology perspective, as everyone knows. Back then it was not all of the mobile apps. Imagine where we were 10 years ago, there was no mobile apps, really there was no remote working, very little remote working. All of the things that businesses now -- and by the way, their employees are getting used to and those that you might employ or retain are getting used to, what can you do with the mobile app? Can you provide online training? Can you provide pay-on-demand? Can you provide your 401(k) balances and loans online? Can you do all these things online, connect with your employees? It\u2019s such a different environment. And I think this is going to change the workforce permanently to say, wow, I\u2019ve seen these things that I can do remotely and through self service. I want part of that. I don\u2019t want to necessarily do old school, somebody writing me a check or handing me a check even. I think all of these things are going to get people used to a whole new world, which are going to drive more people to the technology investments that we\u2019ve made. So, I think there\u2019s two very-positive impacts here as we come out of this that could say, more new business start-ups and existing businesses that reignite are going to be looking for someone like us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Bryan Bergin : Hi, guys. Thanks for the early guide for us here. And Efrain, I appreciate the LIE analogy. Thank you for that one. Efrain Rivera : All I ask all of you is to remember when I was wrong that I at least tried. I led with my chin. Bryan Bergin : Here you go. I wanted to ask, just from a business mix standpoint, can you just give us some color on where you are expecting the most and the least pressure? As we think about PEO and Management Solutions, and then the various offerings within Management Solutions that are most and least insulated here? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So, one thing I think we should mention, I think it\u2019s been -- it\u2019s part of the, I guess, the backdrop. I mean, just take off from what Marty said, build on what he said. We\u2019re a very different business than we were in \u201808 or \u201809. At the end of this year, about half of our revenue or less than half of our revenue will be payroll. If you split our business, about 80% of our client base is under 20. But that -- our revenue is split pretty evenly below 20 and above 20, 50-50. So, that\u2019s a very different animal than we were in the \u201808, \u201809 timeframe. And while we do apply that thought process to how we\u2019re looking at the future, there are some differences. I think, we could see -- we could very well see, to Marty\u2019s point, increased demand for anything HR services related. And by the way, if I slice now the Rubik\u2019s cube -- you can slice a Rubik\u2019s cube. But if I slice our revenue, about 50% of our revenue is derived from HR-related products. So, you could very well see an increase in demand, to Marty\u2019s point, given the complexity of what Congress is about to unleash. And let me tell you something. Emails fly every single night here about what\u2019s in the bill, what\u2019s out, what the implications are? There\u2019s lots of good things in that bill for businesses, but it requires interpretation. So, I would say, from an HR standpoint, you could see increased demand, which Marty has been talking about. And then, on where we see more stress is on the smaller businesses, who -- if they don\u2019t get a lifeline over the next six to eight weeks, are going to be severely impacted and stressed. So, I would say, in broad strokes, higher demand for HR and related services. That could include PEO, by the way, because we\u2019d include that in, and more impact on smaller client simply because of the depth and the severity of this correction. Bryan Bergin : Okay. And then just payroll tax holiday implications. We\u2019ve got the question. So, curious here, how we think about the impact from a potential payroll tax holiday that might be in this final stimulus bill? Martin Mucci : Yes. I don\u2019t think -- from a standpoint of interest on client funds that we withdraw and then pay those, pretty small. Of course, we won\u2019t earn much on it anyway, because there is no interest. So, I don\u2019t think it will be a very big impact at all. Efrain Rivera : Yes. So, I thought you were talking about what the business impact, whether we think that alone would drive some significant improvement. I think you\u2019re going to have to go deeper than that to really make an impact for most clients. But Marty\u2019s right. If that\u2019s a question related to interest on funds held for clients, I think the Fed\u2019s kind of helped us there, if we are backhanded way. So it\u2019s not going to impact very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : I just wanted to talk a little bit about kind of the administrative challenges tied to effecting fiscal stimulus. I\u2019m just curious, given how close you are to that market, what thoughts you might have on the most effective way for the federal government to handle that initiative. What would seemingly be a very difficult task, given just the sheer number of small businesses in the U.S.? And obviously, it\u2019s important how fast it\u2019s handled. So, I\u2019m just interested in your thoughts on the challenges of effecting that change? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think, if you look back at like 2008-2009 and of course, not even close to the amount of stimulus that is being done now, things took -- I think the average time it took to get a check or money to small businesses was like 50 days we went back and looked at it. So, it was roughly a couple of months. That needs to be so much faster now, because of, in particular the shutdowns that have occurred in many states of small businesses. They need to pay their rent. They need to pay employer -- employees to keep them with them, which because you\u2019re going to come back I think to a pretty good employment. Two weeks ago I said it\u2019s amazing. Their biggest issue was how do I find employees to fill my jobs? And now, I want to keep them. So I think, speed is such an essence and -- of such an essence. And I do think that we could -- payroll processors could be such a help because we could immediately continue to pay that payroll that we paid last week or the week before and then just look for those funds from a government program, the SBA, whoever. I mean, however, they do it is fine with me as long as they give that backstop and it does look like they\u2019re going to do that to give that payroll. But if it\u2019s a long SBA loan process that takes paperwork that -- et cetera, et cetera, that\u2019s not going to help us many -- many, you\u2019ve seen have already laid off employees across the country, whether they\u2019d be hotels or whatever. And I think they got to move really quick. Administratively, one of the great things with our size and our experience is that we have over 200 compliance specialists. Our compliance people have been on the phone with the federal government, Congress, the Treasury, the IRS, the SBA, you name it, and are working with them, not only to answer their questions about what could be done but also trying to help say this could be the fastest way to do something and so forth. And so, we\u2019re very supportive of the work that the government is doing, and we\u2019re very much in touch with them. And we think we could turn it around pretty quickly. We have a lot of resources, 1,500 people in IT and we\u2019ve been talking daily. And they understand that depending on what comes out, we\u2019re going to -- everything gets turned to that. Our first thing is to comply with these regulations and be sure our employees and our clients and their employees are taking care of. Andrew Nicholas : And then, as my follow-up, obviously there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces right now. But, I just wanted to get your sense for the impact of social distancing and working from home may have on your sales force\u2019s ability to sell new business, particularly within PEO where you have enough white space that may be a material slowdown in new business starts is less of a headwind. I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019d expect sales cycle to lengthen, to slow considerably. Just on account of less face to face interaction, all else equal? Martin Mucci : Yes. It\u2019s kind of a mixed -- it\u2019s a mixed situation. While we said leads were down a little bit, there is still pretty strong lead flow coming in for payroll and HR. And because we\u2019ve had so many years of virtual selling, we have a lot of experience in selling, which I mentioned earlier, we have now taken that training that have been used for virtual sales, which by the way is virtual sales is lower cost and pretty productive from a web lead perspective. And so, we\u2019re now training the field sales force. Hey, here\u2019s a way if you have to do it remotely and someone doesn\u2019t want to meet, here\u2019s how we demo the product, we can use the same tools for the field sales force where they would have demoed something in person. Here\u2019s how you can do some things online. And here -- and the good news is everything can be done electronically. So, you don\u2019t have to be in front of a client to have them sign something necessarily. A lot of the document management can all be done electronically and kind of a DocuSign kind of features. And then, all of that\u2019s sent to remote on boarding specialist who can set up the client in a very short period of time. So, it certainly is going to -- it has some impact in clients not wanting to focus on it right now or meet in person. But, I do think that we have a vast amount of experience in a very effective virtual sales team that that will continue to grow frankly. And the field sales force is finding ways to get in touch with their clients, get in front of their clients through email, through chat, through calls, and they\u2019re very receptive to that and appreciative that we\u2019re here. It\u2019s amazing that many clients or prospects think that because you\u2019re home, they\u2019re not going to be able to reach you. That is not the case at all. We\u2019ve never lost any contact with anybody. And as I said, our IT team has done a tremendous job in moving 15,000 people remote and then being able to handle it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much. And Efrain, really appreciated your remarks at the beginning, especially the segue from being human to talking about finance. Just one quick question. You talked about how I guess your business or your customer facing business is different now. I\u2019m just wondering, internally, when we compare your business to the prior shocks or the prior recession, is there anything different, or is that more of a variable cost structure than you had before? Any color would be great. Efrain Rivera : Yes. And I\u2019ll let Marty talk about what substantively is different in terms of how we operate. But. I think, look, if you\u2019re in a service business, I said 65% people and 35% variable, which is -- the comparison 65% people and 35% other, not all of that is variable. I would say that we\u2019ve moved the cost structure in such a way that more of that cost structure supports the other parts of the business. I would say that structure, you guys who are -- you guys, but you who are analyzing it, now that that\u2019s the way most the split of cost that most businesses have is distributed differently. And so, the implication of that is that we don\u2019t have as many costs tied up in one part of the business that we had during the last downturn and we\u2019ve got a little bit more diversification across the cost base, so that we support more business that is not purely payroll. Nothing wrong with supporting payroll. But as I said before, half of our business now is HR related. So, I\u2019ll let Marty.... Martin Mucci : Yes. I think just from an internal flexibility, we\u2019re on a unified -- what we call unified communication system that we\u2019ve installed over the last number of years. And so, we can easily move calls all across the country, even to which we have never tested before, having all of these people work from home, which is an incredible technology difference than it was in the last shock. And you have a lot of flexibility to have teams in different areas and move teams around and so forth. So, there is a lot of flexibility here as to how you control costs, how you look at your employee base and give them support tools. And we\u2019ve always been good obviously controlling our cost and I think having a great focus on margin and we\u2019ll continue to do that. And there is probably as much or more flexibility now than there ever was. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Samad Samana : Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking all of our questions. I really appreciate it. I know it\u2019s running kind of long. Efrain, maybe just one quick question for you on -- I know you guys mentioned a couple of different anecdotal comments about what you\u2019ve seen in maybe the second half of March. But, if I could maybe triangulate a little more precisely on new booked business, what have you seen happen in terms of new bookings over the last couple of weeks? And then, what new bookings type of assumptions are you making for fiscal \u201821? Thanks again for taking my questions. And hopefully everybody\u2019s families are safe and healthy. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Hey, Samad. So, we wouldn\u2019t give you -- we wouldn\u2019t give precise info on bookings. And then, we wouldn\u2019t typically give precise bookings on what we anticipate. But, I think, we all know that given lead flow, bookings are down. And given what we expect in the remainder of the quarter, we also expect them to be down. Do we expect it to be -- fall off a cliff? Absolutely not, for many of the reasons that Marty said. If the stimulus gives a jolt, it may actually be helpful. There are things in that package that may cause the businesses that are there to book other services, even if they\u2019re not booking based payroll. But, this is a challenging environment for sure. Samad Samana : Maybe if I could ask just one from a competitive standpoint. It sounds like price was able to stick during the F3Q. I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve seen a change in competitive behavior, either pricing more aggressively to capture as much business as possible before the gears start to slow down or maybe just how are your competitors reacting from a pricing perspective in the current environment? Martin Mucci : Yes. Not seeing -- there is some three months here and there, first three months of this service or that service, but not seeing too much, too aggressive yet. Does it get more aggressive? It may. On the other hand, I think when you look at it, again, as I mentioned earlier, I think businesses are worried about a lot more than -- when you think about our average business that might pay a couple of thousand dollars a year, 2,400 a year, 2,500 a year, they\u2019re looking for whether they save $200 or $500 is not that critical to them right now. It\u2019s, hey, can you give me the service, and can you give me the service that I need, the service -- excuse me, and the products that I need to survive in this environment? So, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see a little bit more discounting here and there. But frankly, it\u2019s a little bit misguided in the back of what clients are looking for, in my opinion. Efrain Rivera : Yes. To Marty\u2019s point, we -- it\u2019s easy to overlook it. But, when you have response time measured in seconds, I\u2019d ask you to ask all of our competitors what their response time are. Service may not seem like it\u2019s all that important in other environments. I can tell you, based on the interactions we\u2019re having, we could post all of the comments that we\u2019ve gotten from clients about how responsive we\u2019ve been on the website. It\u2019s going to become very, very critical. One of the things that we\u2019re very proud of, Marty said it earlier, is that we moved everyone to work from home and our service times have been tremendous and our response times to clients have been tremendous. And they are asking a lot of questions. And if the -- if you can\u2019t get to them and you can\u2019t service them, they\u2019re probably going to have some second thoughts about whether they continue with you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen with Citi. Pete Christiansen : Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for the update and certainly for your poignant sentiments earlier. Good news, I think, we\u2019re hearing that in the bailout so far, the stimulus is providing $10 million -- up to $10 million for individual businesses and provided no layup. So, perhaps there is some upside to the outlook here. So, fingers crossed. And I appreciate your thoughts that the devil will be in the details. But, I was just hoping, if we can go back to the Rubik\u2019s cube very quickly and if we can quantify your exposure between hourly workers versus salaried workers and perhaps what you\u2019ve seen earlier. And then, as a follow-up, looking back to the last downturn, it looks like the dividend rate was held steady for quite a bit at risk of pulling the cart in front of the horse here. How should we think about that? Would we expect to see something similar, at least over the near term? Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Pete, I don\u2019t have much for you on hourly versus salary. I have to get that breakdown and figure that out, so -- and don\u2019t have a precise answer on that. With respect to the dividend, look, our earnings amply support the dividend we have. Whether we should increase it, will depend in part on the discussion that we have with the Board and where we are when we present the plan. We try to peg it around 80% or so. Obviously, in some situations that might be a little bit higher. So, we\u2019ll have to go through that conversation with the Board in terms of what level they want to set it out. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Lisa Ellis : Hi. Good morning, guys, and thanks for squeezing me in. Martin Mucci : Hi, Lisa. Sure. Lisa Ellis : Couple of questions on workers\u2019 compensation, actually. I know we are, I guess, presumably going from an abrupt period where workers\u2019 comp claims and premiums were very low to probably the inverse of that. Can you just remind us -- I know the premium going up will actually be a tailwind to your insurance business, but in general, how does that kind of dramatic shift impact you? Thanks. Efrain Rivera : Yes. It would be a tailwind to the insurance business. It would also have a modest impact on our PEO business from a revenue standpoint. So, both of those would be positive. On the other hand, where we are -- where we have some at-risk exposure in -- on the workers\u2019 comp side in the PEO, we\u2019d have to monitor that. So, I think it\u2019s on balance more to the positive side of the ledger. And then, you\u2019ve just got to manage reserves appropriately. Lisa Ellis : Yes. And then on that point of the follow-up, because I know we get questions about this. Can you just remind us? I was looking in the K, it looks like your reserve level and workers\u2019 comp is something like $170 million or so in total across like short-term and long term? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Lisa Ellis : And then, how is that capped or reinsured again? Could you just remind us, like how much actual risk exposure do you really have? Is that the way to think about it, it\u2019s kind of that number or how does that work exactly? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I\u2019d have to look back. I think, we say in the K what we have in terms of exposure. I think, it\u2019s around $1 million, I want to say, per case. $1 million workers\u2019 comp case is a very, very unusual case in my experience. It\u2019s capped there. But beyond that, by the way, that\u2019s only part of the equation. What you have to look at is the development of claims, which we look at on a quarterly basis and add to reserves, as they\u2019re needed. So, our typical workers\u2019 comp adjustments are modest. And generally, we end up in a positive reserve situation. So, we should be able to manage well. There\u2019ll be no change in terms of the way we manage. We don\u2019t anticipate a significant impact at this point. Lisa Ellis : And then, just a quick follow-up, one on the attrition. I think you\u2019ve said in the past that about 9 points of your attrition each year come from businesses going out of business, just in like a normal period. Is that about the right number? And then, can you just dimension, like how much worse that got back in \u201809 or after 9/11? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So, what you\u2019re doing is taking about half of the 18% that we would average. I think, it closes somewhere between 8%, 9%. You can -- we\u2019ll see a spike. I can\u2019t call it yet, Lisa. But, if we go back, back to \u201808, \u201809, it spiked up to about 23%, 24%. But our base was about 20%, 21%. Most of that 3% to 4% was coming from\u2026 Martin Mucci : Yes, out of business. Yes. No, it\u2019s exactly what Efrain said. Most of that came from out of business. But please remember, that one went longer. So, this one is just kind of hard to measure because we think we\u2019re going to have -- depending on the stimulus that could hold the front here for a couple of months, if it really could help them quickly and then how long does it go before they open back up or give up and go out of business. It\u2019s going to be very interesting. It doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s going to be as bad as \u201808, \u201809 because that went on for seven quarters and businesses couldn\u2019t survive. These -- hopefully, they could furlough, they could come back, I don\u2019t -- I really -- it\u2019s obviously hard to predict a few weeks into this, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be -- we wouldn\u2019t expect that would be that bad. It might be more -- it\u2019s going to be more of a shock in the first -- probably maybe first quarter of next year, but then bounce back pretty quickly, we would think at this point. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Mark Marcon : Hi, Marty and Efrain. Thanks for squeezing me in and best wishes to you and your families. With regards to the stimulus, what elements that you\u2019ve heard discussed around the stimulus are you most excited about that could potentially have a positive impact? Martin Mucci : Well, definitely, the small loan program, the small business loan program. Anything that as I\u2019ve mentioned that would keep paying employees of small businesses and keep them in place is really important depending on how long this goes. If it\u2019s shorter than -- if it\u2019s shorter rather than longer, that could make a big difference as to whether our business goes out of business or not and they keep their employees employed. I think also, the unemployment benefits is also another way that a small business might say, hey, I\u2019m going to furlough you, I might pay you. There has been different rules discussed about paying half. There is certain rules that are out there about sharing a job where you could furlough, you could pay someone, you could keep two people instead of laying off. You got two people, instead of laying off one and keeping one, you could have them job share and then make it up with unemployment. That could have some impact depending on where they -- how they handle those regulations. I think, anything around supporting small business and employees with their wages is the most important thing. Hey, the direct checks can hurt. But, I\u2019m not sure what that\u2019s going to do as much as from a business standpoint is keeping businesses going. That\u2019s kind of how I think of it anyway at this stage, based on what we\u2019ve seen. Mark Marcon : What\u2019s your level of confidence that that\u2019s -- that those elements that you cited are going to go through, based on all the interactions that you\u2019ve had? Martin Mucci : Pretty strong, pretty strong. I think, there has been a very little disagreement on the small business loan program. There has been -- we still don\u2019t know how they\u2019re going to procedurally enact it. That is important, but that\u2019s not clear yet. But, I do think, based on all the discussion, they\u2019re are going to try to do it as quickly as possible with as little red tape as possible, and that will be very important, but feel pretty good that those things are going to get enacted. They haven\u2019t been argued much at all. It\u2019s been more of the large business stimulus giving money to the airlines, et cetera that seems to have the bigger arguments. Mark Marcon : What sort of a marketing program could you put in place in order to take advantage of that because that -- obviously your capabilities to deal with something like that would be far greater than any independent companies. Martin Mucci : Yes. Very much so, already positioned the marketing to even over a week ago about how we can help you. And we\u2019ve had webinars that have been kind of blown the doors off from the number of people and CPAs that join those webinars because they want to know about it. So, I think we\u2019re well positioned from a marketing and training perspective for our clients and prospects to take advantage of those. Mark Marcon : Great. If I could shift gears just for the follow-up component. Can you just talk about the percentage of business that you have in New York, in California and the states that have gone through the shutdowns? And what you ended up seeing in those states during the [Technical Difficulty] days? Martin Mucci : Yes. If there is a -- there is a number of businesses, not all of them are the small businesses. But, I think -- I do think it\u2019s -- might be up around the 40-year -- well, I think New York and California alone, I don\u2019t have that data for all of the states that are shut down, which includes New Jersey, Illinois and California, New York. Of course, we kind of follow the population. So, it\u2019s probably around 50% or so that are in those. But again, they\u2019re not all small businesses that are necessarily impacted by the shutdowns and partial shutdowns that you\u2019re seeing. Mark Marcon : Okay. And what were you seeing in the states that are shut down in terms of like the very recent trends? Martin Mucci : Very early, but mostly, we\u2019re seeing more of the -- I\u2019d say -- I\u2019m furloughing -- I\u2019m staying open, I\u2019m doing like restaurants and stuff. Again restaurants being 5% or 6%, but that\u2019s where you\u2019re seeing the most impact. They\u2019re saying hey, I\u2019m going to try to furlough people. I\u2019m going to try to keep my employees, maybe only keep three of them out of six or 10 out of 20, but I\u2019m staying open so far. And again, those people in flex in that survey that I mentioned early on, we\u2019ve gotten the huge response on that. And it\u2019s still been 50% are minimal impact at this point, and another 40% are saying, I\u2019ve done some layoffs or furloughs, but I\u2019m continuing to run. That\u2019s all been very good news. What we don\u2019t have a great handle on yet is any losses, because you\u2019re going to see those more probably next week or end of this week, if they\u2019re completely going out of business. But more of the feeling is, I\u2019m going to try to hang on here, see with the stimulus is, try to furlough my employees, so I keep them and continue to do what I can with minimal staff. Mark Marcon : Great. And then, one last one. [Technical Difficulty] Martin Mucci : Mark, you\u2019re breaking up there. Could you try that again? Mark Marcon : Yes. Just the portfolio composition with regards to the flow balance, what are you seeing there? [Technical Difficulty] Martin Mucci : Do you mean securities in the oil industry, Mark, or\u2026 Mark Marcon : Securities in the oil industry, your muni portfolio. Martin Mucci : Yes. They are solid. We haven\u2019t had any issues, haven\u2019t had seen any impairments of any securities. Obviously, we invest in very highly liquid and highly safe securities. So, we had a few in the oil industry, but we haven\u2019t had any impairments. But, it\u2019s very small part of the portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Tien- tsin Huang : Hi. Thanks so much for the hard work here. Just on the margins, just wanted to clarify. It looks like you\u2019re guiding to I think 35% versus the 36% this year. Is that just a function of the decremental margin of -- sorry, I forgot it. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Hey, Tien-tsin. So, yes, just want to say preliminarily, we see it around 35%. Yes. What\u2019s happening Tien-tsin is right now, my assumption is the portfolio is down around $20 million, or maybe a tad higher. That portfolio drops straight to the bottom line without a lot of expense offsets that we assume that we\u2019re going to take actions to obviously offset expenses in other areas. But, it\u2019s hard to -- it\u2019s hard in the short term at this point off of 6 weeks of data to say here\u2019s how we go after replacing some of that margin. I would say, we\u2019re pretty good at it. If you remember, \u201808, \u201809, we took a tremendous hit on the drop in the portfolio, nowhere near as severe here and found a way over time to make it up. But yes, that\u2019s one component of what creates the drop in margin. Tien- tsin Huang : Okay. That makes sense. So, you\u2019re being conservative here. If things get a little bit worse, there is room to do more, but you just see it -- calling it as you see it and then you can move on? Got it. And then, just really quickly, I know a lot of people ask good questions on the outsourcing, what happens on the recovery. How about on PEO? I\u2019m curious if we could see a shift there, if people want to manage their medical side a little bit better, but also I guess, the risk that carriers might up prices in anticipation of higher cost also and that might price out others. I\u2019m trying to better understand how you think about PEO here, given that you\u2019ve put some more capital into that business in the last three years? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Contingent -- I mean, that\u2019s a great question. So, here\u2019s how at least some preliminary thinking on that. If you have a lot of costs rippling through your healthcare plans, you may not feel them at first, but eventually you\u2019re going to feel them. And then, your clients are going to be impacted to one extent or another. Through the course of this year and as we have managed the integration of Oasis, what we\u2019ve seen is there is tremendous opportunity to operate a PEO, ASO hybrid model, where were you have an ASO with the provision of benefits from our insurance agency and in some ways -- and sometimes it\u2019s better for you to go through our insurance agency on the PEO, instead of being on some sort of PEO master plan. So, I think you\u2019re going to have to figure out some -- be flexible and agile in terms of what you provide on the benefit side and what solutions you provide, either one-off through an insurance agency, a master plan or some other arrangement. So, I think, what we\u2019ve seen is that ASO and PEO kind of converging, and in some cases full PEO is the better model for some clients, in some cases ASO is the better model for other clients. So, you could see shifts between those categories, depending on what happens in each of those markets as we go through the year. Martin Mucci : Yes. I think that\u2019s exactly right. Tien-tsin, you brought up the right thing. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to insurance. Right? It depends on how many claims are filed and whether you have a lot of claims, there\u2019s a lot of costs that are going to be covered, like the testing and so forth. So, it\u2019s kind of early to tell, but it will be that balance. But as Efrain said, I think then that can shift toward ASO model. But, I think the PEO model will still be pretty strong. I think, this is bringing awareness of insurance plans and employees. There\u2019s going to be this fight for employees again, in finding them for your businesses. And I think insurance could be an even stronger selling point now as an employer who is trying to hire people. So, that may bring even more cloud to the PEO. It\u2019s going to be an interesting balance as we come out of this. We\u2019re well positioned obviously with both ASO and PEO to do that. Tien- tsin Huang : Yes. You got them both. Yes, I trust you guys would be right on that. Thank you all for the candor. It\u2019s very comforting. Thanks. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : Hey, guys. Glad you\u2019re healthy. I was just curious as it relates to revenue sensitivity, the changes in certain key metrics, like ADP has talked in the past though 1% change in client retention has about 6 times the revenue impact as a 1% change in bookings, just as an example. I mean, should we assume kind of similar types of relationships hold for Paychex, or any specifics you feel comfortable sharing, just so we can think about the way forward? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Hey. I would just say broadly a drop of -- a change in our loss rate of about 1% yields about $25 million of impact -- is it $25 million? $2.5 million, I\u2019m sorry. $2.5 million. Checks or pays per control are really the most important. So, it sounds like they\u2019re somewhat similar to what we are. But, we\u2019ll see as we work through our plan. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. And then, I just wanted to go back Efrain to I think answer to an earlier question. It sounded like you guys are assuming a similar amount of [Technical Difficulty] client retention as you saw the past couple of recessions. So, is the reason you\u2019re not assuming anything deeper than that just because of the change in mix since those last recessions, like the HR and the PEO mix, or are there other factors? Efrain Rivera : Yes, Jason. That\u2019s the impact. I mentioned earlier just providing some color, if you look at our business, 50% of our revenues are with clients that are 20 -- and under 50% are clients 20 and over. That\u2019s a different mix than we had during the last recession. Of course, there are scenarios where it could get a lot worse than that, depending on how long the downturn lasts. But, at this point, that\u2019s our best guess on the modeling. Martin Mucci : Yes. Again, on the timing, and obviously not knowing that timing, but you could have this larger drop in checks in the first half of the year -- fiscal year, and then come back. And that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking that over that period of time -- I think over the fiscal year, it might balance out like past recessions have been. So, it might be a little stronger in the early part, but I think if the bounce back -- everybody has a different view, but if it\u2019s a bounce back in the second half, it could be a pretty strong bounce back in checks. Jason Kupferberg : Right. So, maybe a deeper trough, but I hear what you\u2019re saying. And then just last one real quickly. [Technical Difficulty] or refunding certain fees to help customers stay afloat or defer price increases or anything along those lines? Martin Mucci : Well, we\u2019re looking at it. Again, we haven\u2019t had that much of a push from that\u2019s what they\u2019re concerned about and we want to -- we\u2019re focusing really on what they need at this point to survive and get through all of the stimulus packages and the downturn and so forth and shutdowns. So, that hasn\u2019t been that critical from a client perspective. Obviously, we\u2019re looking at the price increase. And I think it\u2019s going to be prudent to push that out a little bit, and we\u2019ll continue to watch that as we go month-to-month. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. David Grossman : Great. Thank you. I know it\u2019s pretty late here. Just one really quick question. Martin Mucci : It\u2019s early for you, David. David Grossman : That\u2019s one way to look at it, I guess. But, yes, just quickly on your commentary about your mix of PEPM versus subscription. I think you said one-third PEPM and two-third subscription. Can you just help us understand how you get at that? Efrain Rivera : How you get at that? David Grossman : Yes. How you get those percentages? Like, because it seems like a large percentage of mix is really driven by the number of employees. So, just want to better understand that\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Yes. I think, it has to do with the composition of our client base, David. And when you\u2019re smaller, you tend to have more on the subscription side of the equation. For example, we don\u2019t separately disclose SurePayroll, but SurePayroll is purely subscription. So, PEPM has no impact on it. And then, it\u2019s an estimate on other clients, how much of what they\u2019re getting is based on PEPM revenue. And that\u2019s what it ends up being. When you\u2019re smaller, your proportion tends to be more subscription, larger tends to be more on the PEPM side. David Grossman : So, what - just as an example, what are the services you\u2019re including in that subscription bucket? Efrain Rivera : It\u2019s just primarily payroll. But, that\u2019s a big chunk of the Management Solutions revenue. Operator : And there are no further questions. Martin Mucci : All right. Thank you. At this point, we will close the call. We do wish the best to all of -- yourselves and your families, and good health to all of you. Thank you for participating in this call. It will be archived for approximately 30 days. And again, we appreciate your participation and interest in Paychex. And stay safe, everyone. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Paychex Fourth Quarter and Year-End Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir. Martin Mucci : Thank you, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year-ended May 31, 2020. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage. And our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month.  I will start today's call with an update on some of the key metrics and our response to COVID-19, and then review business highlights for the fourth quarter. Efrain will review our financial results for both the fourth quarter and full year, and discuss our guidance for the upcoming fiscal year 2021. And then, we'll open it up for your questions or comments. In May, we provided you with an update on our business as we were responding to the impacts of COVID-19. At that time, we talked about the positive trends we were seeing in our key metrics, but it was still early. Over the past month, we have continued to experience steady improvements across all of our key metrics we are tracking on a weekly-basis. We are seeing a steady increase in paid employees and in the number of worksite employees for our HR outsourcing clients. We have also continued to see an increase in sales leads and sales productivity. One particular bright spot is client retention. Now more than ever, our clients are experiencing the value proposition of Paychex as we help them navigate through this very challenging time. I credit the dedication of our Paychex IT, development, product, marketing and service teams who have worked tirelessly to ensure a seamless transition to remote working for us, while providing the products and service to support our clients and their CPAs during a time of great concern for their businesses, in fact many times their business survival. When the Paycheck Protection Program was introduced, we were the first in our industry to release an online payroll report to help simplify the filing of the application for the loan. As a client of Paychex, we pre-populated the payroll information that you had that time. We have processed this report over a half a million times for our clients and their CPAs to assist them. We also partnered with three fintech companies, Biz2Credit, Fundera, and Lendio to provide our clients with direct access to alternative lenders for the PPP loans, if they did not want to go through their own banking partner. Over $100 million worth of loans have been processed through these partners by our clients.  On June 5th, the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act was signed into law, relaxing the original requirements for businesses using -- use of the PPP loans, while continuing to qualify for loan forgiveness. Shortly after we launched the PPP Loan Forgiveness Estimator, this tool, which I feel is the most comprehensive in our market, simplified the complicated process for our clients, and again, pre-populates the Paychex client data and provides a very simple way to add non-payroll data to satisfy the new forgiveness requirements.  Our service teams have provided excellent responsiveness to our clients 7/24, even with much higher call volumes and call complexity, all while maintaining and even improving our client satisfaction and retention performance. In fact, client retention reached a new all-time high.  Throughout this uncertain time, we have seen strong performance in multiple areas of the business. Sure payroll has continued to grow as more prospects are looking for intuitive do-it-yourself solutions. We have seen similar results in our Flex virtual sales efforts. We are also experiencing increased demand for outsourced HR services both PEO and ASO, due to the complex demands of the current environment. Our leading suite of customizable solutions allows us to help any business, large or small, simple or complex, do-it-yourself or fully outsourced with today's challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge to our business. However, this challenge confirmed that the investments we have made in the recent past were the right investments. COVID-19 accelerated many workplace trends and we have had the right solutions in place to help our clients adapt to their new, unexpected environment.  Our five-star rated mobile app provides clients and their employees with access to solutions from anywhere on any type of device. This, along with our broad set of human capital management solutions, and our comprehensive self-service capabilities, have allowed our clients to effectively manage a remote workforce and maintain productivity.  Maintaining employee engagement has been critical for our clients during this time, especially as communications are rarely face-to-face. Whether a client needs to capture and track employee issues and requests, or simply check in with their people, Paychex makes it simple to stay connected and maintain a productive and engaged workforce. This can occur through our HR conversations tool or HR Connect, a tool that recently -- we recently released that allows employees to submit their questions, requests and incidents directly to HR through an easy-to-use workflow.  We have also seen an increase in the use of Paychex Learning, an online learning platform which allows clients to retain employees by providing them with various training and professional development options, even while not in an office environment. Our comprehensive suite of payroll solutions offers flexible payments options to help address employees\u2019 needs or time sensitive situations. We provide clients the ability to pay employees on demand for wages earned prior to pay day and make real time payments in minutes for time sensitive or emergency situations.  We continually enhance our data analytics and live report functionality. Faced with a rapidly changing business environment and market uncertainty, providing clients with access to clear, accurate information is critical for them to make decisions about future -- about the future for their businesses. Recent updates to our analytics suite provide additional insights on labor cost and workers\u2019 compensation information, workplace illness and injury trends and other HR details such as employee record updates and performance feedback. Additional new enhancements are geared toward improved organizational collaboration and streamlining processes through digital solutions, such as allowing for electronic workflow and e-signatures, and direct deposit in W-4 forms, simplifying the process of adding new workers. We offer many new self-service capabilities for our clients\u2019 employees that have streamlined the process for both the employees and the client. We have been a valuable business partner to our clients through this time, providing them with information to navigate legislation, helping them access federal loans and managing a remote workforce. Our extensive number of webinars have exceeded all records of participation with over 100,000 clients and CPAs registering for multiple sessions. While our solutions were invaluable to clients in adapting to the new environment of a remote workforce, they are also key to helping businesses as they begin to reopen and get back to business. By using digital solutions, it helps clients integrate more contactless processes to reduce infection risk at their business.  In regards to our Paychex family, we have an ongoing commitment to our employees to ensure their safety. At this time, we still have over 95% of our workforce continuing to work remotely, and it has been going well. Given this success, we are accelerating some of our strategies to leverage a more distributed workforce. We are implementing plans to reduce our physical location footprint among other expense savings initiatives. These plans have recently been announced to our employees and we are moving forward with these initiatives. As we begin fiscal 2021, we see several reasons for optimism. Our employees remain engaged and have continued to go above and beyond, reacting in real time to continue to provide excellent service to our clients. Our record retention and high client satisfaction, net promoter scores and client testimonials highlight the value we provide our clients and their advisors as we help them navigate this challenging time.  We continue to return capital to our shareholders and our leading indicators continue to show signs of steady progress. While much uncertainty remains as businesses or states pause or delay reopening as a result of COVID-19, we are confident that the value of our offerings is more relevant to our clients than it has ever been and we will continue to provide innovative products and services through online offerings or our well-trained and experienced service providers as we get through this together.  I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thank you, Martin. Good morning to everyone. I'll remind you that today's conference contains the customary forward-looking statements that refer to future events and such -- as such involve risks. Please refer to the earnings release for more disclosure on these statements and related factors. In addition, I\u2019ll periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, et cetera. Please refer to the press release and investor presentation for a discussion of these measures and a reconciliation of the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2020 to their related GAAP measures. Let me start by providing some of the key points for the quarter. Our fourth quarter results reflected the impact of conditions resulting from COVID-19. I'll provide a summary of our results and then discuss our full year fiscal 2020 results. For the fourth quarter, let's start here, total revenue as we saw, decreased 7% to $915 million, largely due to volume declines impacting revenue across our HCM solutions. Total service revenue decreased 7% for the fourth quarter to $890 million.  Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue declined 6% to $662 million and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue declined 11% to $228 million. Interest on funds held for clients increased 14% for the fourth quarter to $25 million. Higher realized gains more than offset lower average investment balances and lower average interest rates earned and this is part of the portfolio repositioning we discussed on an earlier call.  Average balances for interest on funds held for clients declined 8% during the fourth quarter, primarily due to the impact of lower checks per client resulting from COVID. Expenses decreased 8% to $615 million. The decline was largely impacted by reductions in discretionary spending as a result of company-wide expense controls. Op income decreased by 5% to $300 million and reflected an operating margin of 32.7%. EBITDA decreased 5% to $351 million with an EBITDA margin of 38.4%. Other expense net for the fourth quarter includes interest on our long-term borrowings, partially offset by corporate investment income, which was impacted, as you all know, by lower interest rates.  Our effective income tax rate was 24.3% for the fourth quarter compared to 25.8% for the same period last year. Net income decreased 4% to $221 million and adjusted net income decreased 3% to $221 million for the fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share decreased 5% to $0.61 for the fourth quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 3% again at $0.61. Let's talk about year-to-date results. Through the first nine months, results were solid. Our full year growth though is tempered as a result of COVID in Q4, but the year still reflected solid progress. Total revenue increased 7% to $4 billion. Service revenue increased 7%, again to $4 billion with Management Solutions growth at 3% to $3 billion, and PEO and Insurance Solutions growth of 22% to $991 million. Management Solutions benefited from higher revenue per client, PEO and Insurance Solutions benefited from higher revenue per client -- I'm sorry, from the full year of Oasis results, while Insurance Services remained challenged by lower workers' comp premiums.  Interest on funds held for clients increased 8% to $87 million, driven by higher realized gains, partially offset by lower average investment balances and lower average interest rates. Op income increased 7% to $1.5 billion. Operating margin was at 36.1%, comparable to the prior year. Net income and diluted earnings per share each increased 6% to $1.1 billion and $3.04 per share respectively. Adjusted net income increased 5% to $1.1 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 6%, again to $3 per share.  Let's talk about investments and income. Our goal, as you know, is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 2.1%. Average duration is currently 2.9 years, but we're a little bit shorter on the curve. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.5% and 1.8% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year respectively. These are down from 2.1% and 1.9% for the respective periods last year, as you realize the Fed has cut interest rates a number of times this year.  Let's talk about our financial position, which we're particularly proud of. It remained strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of over $1 billion as of May 31, 2020. And it really highlights the strength of the company that we achieved, that result during a very challenging time -- in economic time for both us and our clients. Funds held for clients as of May 31 were $3.4 billion compared to $3.8 billion as of May 31, 2019. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.8 billion for the fourth quarter and $3.9 billion for the fiscal year. Our total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $100 million as of the end of May 31, 2020. This compares with $20 million as of May 31, 2019. The increase in net gain position obviously resulted from declines in interest rates. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $2.8 billion as of the end of May 31, 2020, reflecting $889 million in dividends paid and $172 million in shares repurchased during fiscal 2020. Our return on equity for the past 12 years remained strong at 41%. Cash flows from operations were also strong. We reached $1.4 billion for the fiscal year, that's an increase of 13% from the same period last year and the increase was driven by higher net income, amortization of intangible assets and fluctuations in net working capital. So, we ended the quarter in a very, very strong operating position in cash and cash flow. Let's talk about 2021. The outlook that I'm about to present reflects our current thinking regarding the speed and timing of the economic recovery. I don't need to remind you of how volatile the situation is, and we\u2019ll talk about this in terms of really the first half and the second half of the year. We expect the impacts on the first half year will be significant, and then there will be improving sequential -- we will start improving sequentially, and recovery is going to occur in the second half of the year, primarily in the fourth quarter. This outlook also includes various expense control measures we have implemented, which I'll discuss shortly, including a one-time charge that we're going to take in the first half of the year. I'll come to that and discuss that more fully in a second. Our outlook is as follows :  Management Solutions revenue is anticipated to decline in the range of 1% to 4%. PEO and Insurance Services revenue is anticipated currently to decline in a range of 2% to 7%. Interest on funds held for clients is anticipated to be between $55 million and $65 million. Total revenue is anticipated to decline in the range of 2% to 5%. Adjusted operating income as a percentage of total revenue is anticipated to be between 34% and 35%, which excludes, as I mentioned earlier, the impact of one-time costs, which I will discuss in a moment. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year 2021 is expected to be between 39% and 40%. Other expense net is anticipated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million, and the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2021 is expected to be in the range of 24.5% to 25%. I'll just remind you too that we don't include in any of these projections what we expect benefit from stock comp expense. We adjust that out. So, that could change depending on what benefit we get during the year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to decline in the range of 6% to 10%.  Now, as Martin mentioned earlier, given what we've experienced over the last several months, we are accelerating a range of cost savings initiatives. These include headcount optimization, in addition to reduce discretionary spend. In addition, we're planning an acceleration of our long-term plan to reduce our geographic footprint. And this is the majority of the charge that I'm about to describe. We anticipate recognizing one-time costs in the neighborhood of $40 million, most of which will be incurred during the first quarter. Our guidance for adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted diluted EPS, which I'll remind you again are non-GAAP measures, excludes these one-time costs. Again $40 million, we expect it to be primarily in the first quarter and it is primarily directed at geographic optimization, a plan that we had in place and that we've decided to accelerate given current conditions. Now, I've given you full year. Let me give you some color on the gating. One of the things that I would say is we will post on the website our presentation. You can take a look at it. It'll provide some detail on this also. So hopefully, that will be clear once you\u2019ve read it. But now let me just describe what we're anticipating. We currently expect revenue to be the most impacted during the first quarter of fiscal '21 with each quarter improving sequentially. We view fiscal 2021 in terms of first half and second half of the year. So let me talk about the first half. We anticipate that in the first half, Management Solutions revenue will be down mid to upper single-digits, and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue will be down in the high-single-digits to low-double-digits. Adjusted operating margins, excluding the one-time costs that I just mentioned, are anticipated to be approximately 32%.  Now specifically Q1, I would say that the greatest impacts are going to be felt in that quarter and total revenues anticipated to be down high-single to low-double-digits range in Q1 and operating margin is anticipated to be approximately 30%. So be sure to bake that into the model. In the back half of the year, we anticipate greater improvement with much of the recovery occurring in the fourth quarter. So we see it accelerating into the fourth quarter and in the fourth quarter it'll look much more like a normal quarter pre-COVID.  Management Solutions, and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenues are expected to grow in the low-single-digits. And when I say low-single-digits, I mean low. So it's the combination of Q3 and Q4 because Q3 is a big revenue quarter and we still don't anticipate full recovery in Q3 with more of it occurring in Q4 combines to create low-single-digit revenue growth. Adjusted operating margins are anticipated to be approximately 37%, reflecting both higher seasonal margins in the third quarter and the improvement that we expect to see in revenue. So I'm talking now about the second half of the year, where we typically see higher margins. Adjusted earnings per share again in the second half are expected to be flat to down low-single-digits. So let me refer you back to the investor slides, so you can think through all that gating.  And with that, I will turn it back over to Martin. Martin Mucci : Thank you, Efrain. And Lisa, we'll now open up for questions please. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Damian Wille : This is Damian on for Ramsey. Good to see some of the improvement in trends here sequentially. I guess, the big question here for me is on 2021, just how you characterize the conservatism in your guidance. In other words, are you assuming there\u2019s some sort of improvement in the key metrics throughout the year? Or to what extent is it sort of a bottoming out of trends and then you growing over them? Just some color there I think would be really helpful. Efrain Rivera : So that's a fair question. In Q1, obviously, as I just mentioned, we see the most impact. But if I think about where we have been over the last seven or eight years, we've seen sequential improvement -- I'm sorry, several years -- several weeks, it's felt like years sometime. We've seen sequential improvement week-by-week. That rate of acceleration is what's a little bit tough to call, but certainly the bottom is in Q1, and then we expect it to be better. And we expect that to continue through the remainder of the year.  I would say, relative to what we expected to see three, four weeks ago, as we started the year, we're doing better. So there's lots of -- there are a lot of signs that point that we're seeing the -- a recovery occurring. Now, how sustained and how quickly that will occur, we'll see as we go through the quarter. So that's the commentary. Certainly I think in the back half of the year you're going to see substantial recovery. Damian Wille : And maybe if I were to just zoom out here then, maybe there is a question for Marty. But can you maybe just give some updated thoughts about the long-term composition of the company's business lines here? Obviously the pandemic has changed a lot for a lot of people. But are you looking more seriously to move into adjacent areas or businesses? In five years, does the Paychex model look similar to how it is today or do you think it changes a little bit? Martin Mucci : Well, I think definitely, we've continued to move more toward being an HR company. And HR, I think, many times people still think of us as small business payroll. But as you can see the way the revenues have grown, we've become more and more of an HR services company for small and mid-sized businesses. And I think that will continue. I think when you see it, we will evolve and that we have continued to evolve in the way that that is needed. So, HR used to be about kind of HR administration. Then it broadened to become more about kind of pushing to the front-end of recruiting and staffing of your firm. And now it will become -- I think even it may become at least in the short-term where how do you bring people back to a physical location? It certainly has become more about how do you handle remote. I think the investments we've made in online in our SaaS products, in mobility, in all of our designs has been very helpful because as I mentioned, you'll still see us is, I think, as an HR company, but I guess what I'm saying is it becomes much more all encompassing and that definition of HR gets broader and broader, and I think we've been able to capture on that everything from staffing and recruiting to a paperless administration from start to finish, of course, retirement and insurances health and workers\u2019 comp, and then you'll also see the analytics now playing a bigger role in HR as well in helping people make decisions, businesses who can't afford that kind of stuff can come with us to get the data analytics, to help them make decisions and so forth. And I think an also lot of it is -- and also it\u2019s turned about training and development of employees. And now with our learning management system that we offer, that was perfect timing to be able to train new employees and develop employees from a remote location, which has been really a critical need for our clients.  So I think in five years, Paychex should be known very much as an HR company that delivers HR support, includes everything from staffing, recruiting, the payroll, to retirement, insurances, you name it, but it's constantly evolving what that is defined as, and I think our technology has positioned us extremely well, now and towards the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Could you expand upon the performance of the key performance indicators in the fourth quarter? I think, Marty, you talked on the Business Update Call about a number of businesses being on hiatus, suspending their processing. I think as of May 19th checks per payroll were down double-digits. What are you seeing in particular on this KPI? And then my follow-up really relates to new bookings trends in the fourth quarter and how the salesforce is operating still mostly remote, some in-person meetings, so forth? Martin Mucci : Sure. David, I'll start with on the key metrics, yes, the -- basically what we referred to as suspended businesses, so they had not gone out of business, but they had suspended processing. And that is down less than a half of where we were at the peak and continues to come down. It has continued to come down each -- really each week. So we're seeing businesses come back. Now, I will say that they're not always coming back with full employment that they had before. So if they had 20 or 30 employees, they might have 15 or 20 now, and you can expect, obviously, that would happen as businesses are at 50% capacity, restaurants and places like that. What we are seeing, we've seen more than half of the suspended businesses come back, which we think is very good, actually relatively quickly. And we're seeing the checks improve and the work site employees improve as well in the PEO and ASO offerings. So that change in base basically has happened quite quickly as well. So they're bringing back employees faster than we had expected. And hopefully that will continue but the trend has certainly been continuous improvement.  On the sales side, we are still remote for the most part. We are starting to visit clients if they want to be visited and the rep is comfortable visiting. We've taken all the necessary safety protocols. But we are finding that some clients want to meet in-person. But frankly, most clients, the majority of our sales are coming from a remote online and in discussion over the phone, and that is working very well. I'm actually amazed that the number of final sales we ended up with in the fourth quarter given the remote workforce that we have. We also permanently shifted a number of our double-digit percentage of our SMB, our small business sales reps to inside sales, because it was going so well. Of course, we've been doing virtual telephonic sales for many years, but we're increasing that number because of the success of it and the productivity of that, and the tools that we had in place already for virtual have continued to work well. So, sales productivity coming up, checks per client coming up and suspended clients, who are suspended processing have been going down quite dramatically. Efrain, anything you want to add to that? Efrain Rivera : I think in addition to all of those metrics, David, we track a number of other metrics, including everything from hours punched, time recorded to funds flow through the systems and they're all showing a pretty significant recovery from the depths of where we were 4 or 5 weeks ago. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Wald with Morgan Stanley. Steven Wald : Great. Thanks for taking my question, Marty, and Efrain. Hope you guys are staying safe and well. Thanks. Maybe just following up on David's set of questions on the KPIs, moving forward towards what you're seeing now, and I believe Marty your comment about client retention being up highest it's ever been. First, can we get that specific number? I think the last we had seen a number there was 82% or just hovering above 82%. And separately, as we think about the revenue dynamics, given client retention is typically a bigger piece for sensitivity on the revenue front, but the revenue guide seems to have changed, stayed roughly the same, the down 2 to 5 sounds like the low to mid-single-digit decline you gave in mid-May. Would it be fair to say that the bookings activity, although, holding up relatively better than what you expected has gotten pretty worse, if the retention has gotten maybe better, or were you already assuming that retention would have gone up? Martin Mucci : No. I think we assume that -- the retention is around 83%, so an all-time high for us. Now, we're conservative. So, when you look at that and we still have the suspended clients, even though they're less than half of where they were at the peak, this is still rapidly changing. So, we're trying to make sure we understand how many clients are suspended and how many may permanently go out of business. Our retention is the best it's been, but we'd like to give it another month to kind of see if those -- all those clients come back or how many are lost and that kind of thing. Bookings, no, I mean, really sales, it continued to be pretty steady. So, we haven't seen any degradation in that -- in sales. Look they're not where they were pre-COVID yet but they are definitely improving. And so, I think it's just all in those ranges. I wouldn't say anything. Sales has been improving and losses and retention I guess I'd say is definitely at an all-time high. But we're waiting to kind of make sure over the next 30 to 60 days that all those clients that we retained have really been retained and are not just in a suspended state that then go out of business. Our losses to competitors have been remarkably improved. So, I don't think -- and also we found a time where people were not moving. So they're not moving to competitors to maybe pickup an extra discount or something like that at a time when they need our help in particular with the loans and other forgiveness calculators that we've gotten a lot of client testimonials on. So we've held more clients. We definitely have done better in not losing clients for price or to competition. And then I think the conservative nature Steven is just kind of watch and what happens here in the next 30 to 60 days. Steven Wald : Okay, great. That's a lot of commentary. Appreciate the comments there. But if I could just quickly follow up on how you guys were thinking about the underlying assumptions. Efrain, really appreciate the granular look at fiscal '21, the first half, even the first quarter versus the second half. Could you talk to how you're thinking about the underlying unemployment rate? I mean I don't know if you're able to put a specific number on it, but maybe a range of where we\u2019ll be sort of as we get to mid-year, maybe the end of the fiscal year? What you're thinking of the exit rate? And also how you're thinking about the disparity between employment in different regions and states driving that? Because clearly, we're seeing very different experiences across states with either -- I don't know whether you want to call it a second wave rising or a continuation of the first wave or some states are really moving towards reopening versus those that are now closing up? Just wondering how you guys are thinking about the underlying assumptions broadly? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So, yes, let me talk to that Steven. So, when you have a shock like this, the impact is felt, obviously you felt that in April and May, and that can -- we knew it would continue into June, July and August, which is our first quarter, and I suspect others will report similar impacts or at least in that same range. Our assumption is that as we get through the first quarter, we\u2019ll start to see improvement, but we are not assuming that we see improvement to pre-COVID levels in Q2. As a matter of fact, we don't see that occurring really until the tail-end of Q3 in the forecast. By the time we get to Q4, I would say that we are now looking at an environment that's much closer to where we were say in Q3 of this year than where we will have been in the first three quarters of the year. And I would say that, that part of the reason for that is that we understand what the recovery of our clients is, what's been happening with checks, what -- where bookings growth is anticipated to be. I think we've done a lot of simulation and modeling to get that reasonably correct.  And so I would say this forecast assumes very modest gradual improvement through the first three quarters of the year. And then in the fourth quarter, obviously, you have an easier compare. So we expect to see results much better than certainly the first quarter. And we're going to monitor it. I think that, to your point, we can tell by vertical who is impacted, we can tell by state, I would say the fact that New York and California are struggling a bit in terms of reopening, doesn't help the outlook. But it's baked into our thinking. And also we assume some recovery -- or in certain states based on verticals that are in that state. For example, Florida in hospitality. We assume that that's going to take a while to recover. And then we'll start to see that as we head into next year, because it makes sense to us that that's what will occur. But I would say in the first three quarters, we are cautious about how quickly that's going to occur. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : Maybe just to pick up on that -- hi, Efrain. Maybe just to pick up on that discussion throughout a little bit. I was curious maybe on some of those states that you mentioned that have gone through these partial reclosings, if you will, Florida, Texas, Arizona. Are you seeing an increase in clients that have had to go dormant for a second time, because of reclosings? Martin Mucci : Jason, let me take front of that or the first part of it. I think we've seen some but not too much yet at this point. It's been relatively recent, of course, in this month. So we haven't seen too much of that yet. And the funny thing is some of the Southern states still are performing the best when you look at our small business index. And when you break it down by region, the South, particularly with construction. Now leisure and hospitality gets hurt, and that'll be hurt by some of these closings kind of coming back, some of the bars and some of the restaurants. But construction is still doing pretty well. And we have a number of clients in that construction business and that support kind of around construction. So home sales are up, new home sales are up double-digit still and a lot of that is the South and then some of the commercial construction is still up in the South, and particularly Florida. So I think that won't hurt us quite as much. Obviously the leisure and hospitality will bounce around a bit. But we haven't seen -- like, we haven't seen at least at this point in our indicators when we look weekly any major drop in those states that have seen some higher occurrence, reoccurrence I guess or a continuation of occurrence and closures. Jason Kupferberg : And I wanted to just ask for a little bit more color on the comment about the client retention hitting the all time high, the 83%. Is that for the full Q4, was that a full year fiscal '20 comment. And maybe as part of that, can you sort of break apart the moving pieces of retention? I know you mentioned takeaways are down, because there's not a lot of switching going on. So just wanted to understand, in the churn that you are seeing, what kind of mix is out of business versus -- [else] versus third-party takeaways? What that's looking like right now? And what you're assuming for the retention number in '21? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think, the hard part right now, as I mentioned, was the suspended accounts. And so, it is our best retention. And it has been because there were fewer takeaways, as we said, and unless leaving for price. Out of business was up slightly. But overall, I think that was probably pretty consistent, maybe up slightly. The improvement, it would come from competitive takeaways or price. And that's the scheme of things. Right now, we expect that given the really high, we also are hitting great net promoter scores and client satisfaction. We've got great client testimonials. We really think clients have felt like between the payroll report that helped them make it easy for them to file for the PPP loan, and then the Loan Forgiveness Estimator that is so comprehensive, we've gotten a lot of great feedback and I do think that's helped drive the value to our clients even more kind of in a crisis when they really needed us, they found that we were there and very helpful to them important. So I think that's helped. The only thing that I said is, we played a little conservative is we'd like to see how the next month or two fall out for the other suspended accounts. Again, they fall in more than in a half of the peak. But we just want to get a sense of, do we hold at that level of retention, or were the some accounts that were suspended, but they're still in business, but they might not make it longer term. Right now at all -- by now I would've thought that many of those would have declared they're out of business, I don't think there would be -- there could be an impact from the reclosings, if you're a bar or a restaurant and you were closed and then you opened back up at 50%, but now you've been closed again, does that have an impact or not? We're not sure yet. But right now we're really positive based on all the facts that we're seeing. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. And just to clarify, the 83% number was for Q4 or that was full year. Efrain Rivera : I'm sorry. Full year, full year, I am sorry. Full year Jason Kupferberg : Where did you exit the year on that metric? Efrain Rivera : Well, 83%, that\u2019s the year -- the end of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thank you. I wonder, I guess, what drove the decision -- hey Efrain and Martin. The $40 million charge, I know you were kind of in the process of doing that. It sounds like a lot of it\u2019s occupancy. Generally it frames, it\u2019s specific geographies. And is it just kind of the success that you saw having forced to do remotely, that they kind of drove that decision. I guess just any additional thoughts around that? And then what the margin impact can be longer term from those actions? Martin Mucci : Sure. I'll start with it. The -- we've been -- we had a plan in place that -- as you know, we had a number of offices across the country. That was our model. And what we were finding is, as we consolidated, as offices got smaller, we were consolidating to regional service centers, we could put better technology in place and so forth. And we had a number of people working from home already. And in fact, when we would close kind of a remote office and we would let the experienced people, many of them work from home from a service perspective because we had all the tools in place. When we saw that 95% of our employees were working from home and that our client satisfaction even went up and our retention was even stronger, we look -- took a look at, is this a way to reduce costs a little bit faster? And we decided to accelerate closing a number of physical locations, allowing people to work from home, even in those local areas and from a service perspective and that we could save a tremendous amount of lease expense, and rental expense in the physical location. So that's why we decided to accelerate it. That's already been announced to our employees and we're already moving forward and taking those steps and that was the majority of the $40 million. There was also -- as Efrain mentioned, there was also some reduction in force, but it was quite small, less than 2% of our employees, it\u2019s still painful to do. But as we worked through the closing of certain offices and so forth and some other reorganizations, we also took those actions as well. Efrain Rivera : On your second question Kevin, if you take the $40 million, you tax effect the $40 million, you can figure out what the EPS impact will be. We anticipate that, that will be -- that will come out of the cost structure going forward. Kevin McVeigh : That's helpful. And then just one quick follow up. It sounds, it assume funded no incremental federal stimulus, again just that was a little concern that, if some of the states don't get incremental funding, there could be some layoffs, things like that. Is that embedded in the guidance as well? Or would that be something that would be another thing that continues to setback? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I don't think we're at that level right now, Kevin. I mean, literally, I would say, if you were in our management meetings every week, we're looking at different scenarios in terms of both what ideas that are coming out of Congress, extension of PPP and what the impact of all of that is. But we're not at a granular level where we're saying, hey, if that happens, it's going result in a bump of X-percent, where it\u2019s still early to do that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : I was just hoping you could compare the resiliency of the PEO business, the payroll business in terms of the health of your end client. Is there any major difference in the way the two client bases have reacted to the current environment, and how is that impacting your outlook for each business? Martin Mucci : Well, I think, I'll start, then ask Efrain if he wants to add something to that. I think we saw a drop in both, obviously with furloughs and things like that. What you saw in the small business on the payroll side, businesses actually shut down or were closed. So, you had no employees there. On the PEO side, usually a little bit larger client base, a little bit larger average clients and they reduced their employees, the worksite employees, but both have come back pretty well, and the worksite employees, basically what we refer to is change in base. So, change of existing employees being paid within the worksite employees, has bounced back I think a little bit better than we expected on the PEO side. There's a great demand for both PEO and ASO. I think this has helped clients who -- I would say on the PEO and ASO side, more people have moved toward that, HR outsourcing, because this is just too difficult for them to handle if they have 25 to 35, 40 employees, which is kind of our average size on the PEO client. I think more have moved that way because of the need and the complexity of the regulations and how do you bring people back, how do you furlough? When do you bring them back? What -- how do you handle all of the changes that have been put in place and for insurances and so forth? And on the small business side, I think we've also seen that come back, but that one has been a little bit more about either being open or close kind of thing where the PEO has been kind of stayed open, but reduced their employee set. Both are showing improvements though and a little bit better than we expected. So, we certainly hope that that continues. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Andrew, what I would add is that the nature of our PEO business is a little different than the nature of our SMB business in terms of its geographic scope. And so, our PEO has more concentration in the State of Florida as we've discussed before. And as a consequence, if you just isolate that factor, we would have more exposure to hospitality and some of the industries that have been hard hit. When we looked at the data, it was pretty clear that there was almost a hair trigger reaction in terms of reducing employees. But to Marty's point, we\u2019re starting to see them come back. I would say we\u2019ve over indexed a bit in some parts of the business on hospitality. So, we probably have been hit a little harder than perhaps other people, other companies maybe. But we're also now starting to see a pretty rapid recovery in terms of worksite employees. I think the state of how your PEO reacts in this environment is going to really depend on where your concentration is. If you're in a concentration in a state or you have a heavy concentration in states that have been shutdown, you're going to end up with one result. If you have one where the -- where a lot of your worksite employees were in a state that remain relatively open, you have a different point, but just to reiterate what Marty said. So we didn't see clients necessarily stopping their processing and what we saw that clients reducing significantly. They're processing and now adding employees back. Andrew Nicholas : And then sticking with PEO, I am just wondering if there's any update to how you're viewing the M&A opportunities out there. I mean how much are you kind of considering the volatility or the variability in the economic backdrop and considering future deals. And are you at a point even now where you might be comfortable moving forward with something like that? Thank you. Martin Mucci : Sure. Yes, we're still very interested. Obviously, we think the PEO business -- it's a growing part of our business. And we do think that there's M&A opportunities out there. We're staying in touch in the -- in this environment, it's a little bit difficult obviously, one from a remote working just the due diligence and so forth. But we're staying in touch with certain opportunities and we're continuing to watch those. It does make it a little bit more difficult, not only the remote piece of diligence, but to understand where they dropped employees or dropped clients. What's the take now, what's the valuation? And many of the possibilities of acquisitions are also a little bit nervous about selling at this point unless you're -- unless we're willing as a buyer or any buyer is willing to kind of overvalue expecting how it's going to bounce back. So it's a little bit of a tenuous time to buy but we're staying very close to that market and very interested for the right opportunity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Just following up on the discussion, thinking about the suspended clients, what percentage of those fall in that bucket still or remain dormant? Is it 10% of the base, 20% of base, I just don't have a good sense of that? Martin Mucci : Much smaller, Bryan, much smaller. I don't think we've given out the number but one it\u2019s dropped in half, even at its peak, it wasn't anywhere near 10%. So, it\u2019s -- yes, that's a good question actually. So that people don't feel like it's too large. It's not that large. We haven't given the number but it's -- I wouldn't -- it's not even 10%. Well, it's probably -- frankly, when you put it all together where we are now might be 1% to 2%. So we probably over discussed that for the numbers that are out there. Bryan Keane : So it's only 1% to 2% that look like they could close down or fail I guess at this point? Martin Mucci : Yes, that are still suspended and suspended as a result of COVID. Because we don't -- we always have some suspended but that are seasonal and things like that. But if we can break out the best we can, what are really COVID related in that timing, it\u2019s definitely under 2%, probably in that 1% to 2% range. Bryan Keane : And does that include businesses that you've already kind of realized that have failed or turned off? Martin Mucci : No. Bryan Keane : Are there another percentage of group already that are closed, that are basically turned off? Martin Mucci : Well, yes, that would be in our lost numbers. So we've already taken those as lost clients. And they're not in the retention numbers. The only thing that's -- in our client base right now, there is a 1% to 2% that are suspended because of COVID. And we're still kind of waiting to see how those kind of end up, if that helps. Anything that went lost already is out of the client base. Bryan Keane : Yes. And so that loss percentage, is that -- was that -- how does that compare to a normal recession? Just trying to get a sense of how big that percentage was? Martin Mucci : Really, at this point, the last recession -- this was so much deeper, but we didn't really -- we -- at this point, we haven't lost, I would say anything like the last recession. Now that went longer and so you lost them over a period of time, probably 18 months. This one was -- we went much deeper. And I think we handled it very well from a payroll specialists and relationships that we had. We kind of talked to them about being suspended. So where they may have said, hey, I'm going to go lost. And if I needed -- if I'm going to start back up, I'll call you again. We kept it from going lost, having to sell it again and competition. And it made it much easier for our clients and easier for us. So it's really been, frankly, a lot better than I would say the last recession 10 years ago, which really those losses were larger and came over a longer period of time. Bryan Keane : And then just last question I had Efrain just thinking about the 4Q guidance. You said, it comes back to more -- looking like more normal growth. And I guess that's the jump off period as we go into fiscal year '22. As I think about the puts and takes there with the weaker numbers versus the easier comp piece of that versus does business start to bounce back with new sales, that kind of thing, how do we think about that trajectory as we head into 4Q and then head into fiscal year '22? Efrain Rivera : Well, I guess it looks like a more normalized quarter, Bryan that\u2019s what the best I can say right now. And I would say this about the second half. Obviously, compared to a normal year, we have less visibility in the second half compared to where we would be otherwise. But I would say, by time, we get around to Q4, there's a number of things that we think will be occurring that are going to create a situation, where that quarter looks a lot more normalized than certainly the first three quarters. So at this point, I'll just hold talking more specifically about Q4 until we start getting our sea legs under us in this year. But I think that we've got reasonably good basis for thinking that that's the way the quarter will look. Bryan Keane : And then as we get into fiscal '22, just there's no reason why it shouldn't be more normalized as well to jump off of that point? Efrain Rivera : So we've been talking about non-processing clients, worksite employees being down, checks per payroll, all that stuff is going to normalize out as we go through. And I think that the point I want to make -- want to reiterate that Marty has been making in this call is that, we have the right kind of model for the situation we are in and what I mean by that is, the tech services model in an uncertain environment is the kind of environment -- is the kind of business that you want to have. Now, it's great that I say that, really is irrelevant that I say it. What's more important is the feedback we're getting from clients. We have not -- never gotten as much positive reinforcement for the role we have played over the last several months. So we think not only do we recover, but we have in the balance of the year the ability to gain share in the market, because we have the right model in an environment that's very uncertain for the kind of clients that we serve. So we are bullish as we go through the year that as we exit the year, we're going to be not only recovered compared to where we are now, but actually going to -- the strength of our model is going to show. And we could very well end up being in a better place than we were when we entered the COVID era. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Bryan Bergin : Wanted to ask on the outlook, how would you characterize the projected sequential improvement in Management Solutions, as far as it being driven predominantly from the improving check volumes versus some of the increased penetration of retirement and some of the other services you referenced? And Efrain, the high teens check volume decline that you called out on the update call, did you say you did better than that here in 4Q, curious how you see that playing out in '21? Efrain Rivera : We did, I would say a little bit better. Bryan in 4Q and we're seeing improvement as we go through Q1. Still early, but that's where we expect. So, to the point, the question that you're asking, yes, we expect that we'll get through Q1. We'll understand what clients didn't make it, and then the clients that remain have an opportunity to grow and to build, and build up their work force and the combination of a better sales environment, a better sales combined with recovery from our clients, then drives a better revenue as we go through the year. Bryan Bergin : And then on pay offerings. So can you just comment on what you're seeing in the adoption of the real-time pay solution versus the pay on demand offering? And then just as we think about an acceleration of digital payment methods from traditional paper checks, is there a margin story to be had for you as potentially through rep service or other means? Martin Mucci : Well, yes, I think so. I mean, I think we're seeing part of the expense reductions that you're seeing and is some of that margin. We become more productive as more clients have gone down line and we provide a lot of self service opportunities. So, in the past, when you think about us, we would take the information, the employee would go to their HR person or their owner of the business to change their direct deposit or, change their address and then go, they would go to us and now that's all self-service.  And so the employee is really able to do all that themselves that saves the client and us. And so you're seeing it much more from that standpoint. On the pay on demand, yes, we're seeing -- it's still early, but we introduced it around December timeframe and I think COVID kind of slowed it down a bit, but we're definitely seeing more and more interest of it. The process, we have to have the client sign up for it, and that's been a little bit more challenging in the last couple of months, but I think it's going to pick up the pace again. And there certainly is a lot of interest and there was interest during the last few months in restaurants that would bring someone back. And even now that brings someone back to do eight hour shift and not do 40 hours, but work eight hours here or eight hours there. And instead of waiting a few weeks for their paycheck, that they were able to use the pay on demand. So I think that has a lot of opportunity going forward. Does it have a lot of margin opportunity? I think it has some there. But because it's more of a -- there is some self-service involved there, and it's less maybe that we have to do, but fundamentally it's going to be a retention piece too. It's going to be something that it's a great product that we have that people want and the clients like and their employees like, and it'll help them retain their employees and us retain the client.  On real-time payments, yes, I mean, we're still I think the only business in the industry that's offering it. We've seen a pretty good pickup for just starting it a few months ago and clients really like it. It's able to get them money in really seconds, minutes, and it's been gotten very favorable reviews from our clients, particularly if they have a last minute change or a mistake that they wanted to correct, they can do that and get it done in minutes instead of waiting for a day to happen or some -- or an ACH or wired transaction. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Jeff Silber : On your Business Update Call, you talked a little bit about what was going-on on the workers\u2019 comp side. I think you'd seen lower rates, but it was offset to some extent by lower healthcare expense, because of fewer electric procedures. Can we just get an update on how that's been trending? Efrain Rivera : I think comparable just, not a lot of changes. We've seen a continuation of those trends into the beginning of the year. Jeff Silber : Okay. And it doesn't matter in terms of geographically in certain states that are opening up faster. It's still pretty steady? Efrain Rivera : Not thus far. So we have a lot of healthcare on the PEO side, healthcare exposure. In the State of Florida -- our results in the State of Florida have been good. So, thus far, that's good. We'll update if we see anything different. Jeff Silber : Okay, great. And just as a follow-up, forgive me if you\u2019ve mentioned this. Did you talk about the expected cost savings that you think you're going to be getting from some of the one-time costs that you talked about? Efrain Rivera : We said, it was embedded in the guidance. We said it was $40 million. We said, if you tax effect the $40 million, you can figure out what the benefit will be and that will continue going forward. Jeff Silber : Yes. I'm sorry, talking about the annualized cost savings from these moves. Efrain Rivera : Yes. So, I think if you take the $40 million and the tax effect, then you'll get the benefit, that we expect going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Lisa Ellis : First one is just a cadence clarification. If I understood the cadence right, it looks like 1Q revenues are expected to be a downtick from 4Q, so high single to low double-digits, despite a lot of these operating metrics. But can you just clarify why that is? Is that because of new sale dipping, because of the pandemic or what causes that? Efrain Rivera : Because, Lisa, remember, Q4 has one month of pre-COVID results in it, and April and May were the COVID months. So Q1 has, you're right, a little bit better results, but unfortunately it also has one less pre-COVID month in Q4 there. Lisa Ellis : And then second one is just a follow up question about the competitive dynamic and Efrain your comments about Paychex winning share as you're coming through this. Are you seeing -- I mean I know you compete still with a lot of legacy regional service bureaus and then also some SaaS players that don't have this service component to their model. Are you seeing a notable shift in the competitive dynamic in your space, meaning are some of these competitors really struggling through the pandemic? Are you seeing an increased win rate against some of them, sorry, just a little bit more color on that? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think Lisa we're seeing -- we're certainly seeing on the retention side, fewer leaving to go to a competitor. And so that we see that as positive from a competitive environment. From a win rate and sales, I would say we definitely are seeing an increase in -- for example like SurePayroll on the low end and the micro end. And we're still trying to work through whether that's competitive win, which we -- it looks like is some of it where we're winning a little bit more there on the micro end. And also that we're getting more clients that have been doing payroll themselves coming out and saying, hey, I'm going to go to someone on online processor. Because SurePayroll benefited a lot on their website and on their offering from what we did on the federal side with the payroll report that help them get the loans that also has the loan forgiveness and a lot of the webinars. So I think they felt a lot of strength in the SurePayroll and Flex opportunity. And so I think we're also winning some there. So I don't think overall the competitive environment -- I don't think we've seen any major disruption there I would say at this point, although there has been -- we've seen and heard some furloughs and layoffs of some of the competitors. But I do think that we are winning, because of the great tools that we've had for COVID that have supported clients and supported prospects who are looking maybe for the first time to outsource. Lisa Ellis : Okay. And then last one for me. Just non-COVID question. On the election, are there any things in the policy agendas of the candidates for the upcoming elections that you're watching for that might create either opportunities or challenges for you? Martin Mucci : Sure. Well, I think, always if there is a change in the leadership, that change tends to go back to more regulations. Now, more regulations in general help us because there's more of a reason to outsource either HR, or payroll for that matter. So I don't -- we don't know -- nothing I've seen yet would say exactly what that opportunity would be. But I would -- typically based on history, there's going to be more complexity, more regulations. And therefore it's going to be more difficult for businesses. I also think, obviously, we're watching corporate taxes, that's more from -- not so much from a product and service opportunity. But, just from -- because being a highly profitable company we're obviously looking to see what will be any tax impact that Biden has already talked about, and so forth.  So -- but from a product standpoint, frankly, typically in a democratic administration, we would have more regulations. And therefore, it would be fairly positive from a product standpoint. And I would also think that there's going to be a number of new rules coming out of recovering from COVID. And that will also make it more complicated for businesses to exist and to handle their employees which will drive more demand for our services. And again, as we've said, a number of times, the way the investments we've made to be able to really respond to a remote workforce, which no matter who gets in, I think is a permanent part of our future. We've made luckily the right investments here that have really helped clients and will continue to help clients be a remote -- handle remote working, and that I think is going to pay off for us going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Samad Samana : Efrain, maybe one on the retention side. I know you guys -- the 83% if I remember correctly, is unit retention number? If we thought about it on a net dollar retention basis\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Add 4%. Samad Samana : You said add 4%. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Samad Samana : Okay. Great. Efrain Rivera : To Marty's point, we also hit a record in terms of -- certainly since we -- since I've been here, in terms of the level of revenue we retain. And just to put a bow on that Samad, that was really pretty extraordinary work by our service providers. And when I say, the strength of our model, I think there is a tendency sometimes to think of that as just adding costs in the model. You can't get to those numbers without those people on the frontlines doing the work they do every single day. So can you get more efficient? Obviously, we've taken steps to be more efficient, but not in terms of people. We've decided that the infrastructure can be a lot more efficient than it is and we\u2019ve made that choice and we decided that the right thing to do in an environment where we expect the business to recover in the back half of the year is not to slash employees. That's not worth what we decided to do. And we decided to get very efficient in terms of what we're doing. And I think that in this year, it really has paid off. Now having said all of that, I will add another caution that Marty said earlier, which is we need to go through the first quarter of the year to see that, of the people who remain in let's call a suspended status at this stage, how many of them will come back and continue to process? We're optimistic, because if you would have pulled us when we started the process, we would have thought the number was going to be very high and it's turning out to be lower meaning there's fewer of our clients that are going lost. So that\u2019s sort of lengthy response to the question. But I do think it's important to highlight that those things work together and there is a role for tech services here done efficiently. And I think that our margins and our experiences prove that out. Martin Mucci : Yes .And I think, I\u2019d just -- I'd like to place on that point, because we haven't really made it that much, but Efrain just brought up one thing and take it a step further. The interesting thing with our model is we've gone to an awful lot of automated self-service and automated responses, automated responses through chat bots. We can answer over 200 questions in an automated fashion now. And it's made our service people much more productive. What we saw in the last two months was like a year-end for us, which those in the payroll business, means your volumes are up like 25% because at year end typically people have bonuses. They have a lot of questions. That's what happened in the last couple of months, April and May, in particular, where we had very much higher volumes and longer calls, because people had questions. So when everything is going well, we have the tools in place for you to do it quick and efficient any way you want it. When you can\u2019t get the answer and do something on an automated fashion, because you don't understand the regulations or how to do something, or how to handle a unique situation like COVID, we had 7/24 service, experienced service providers that were there to answer the questions. And we got a lot of positive feedback about that. A lot of competitors today have gone a lot of automated or going out of the country to provide support that is not at the level that we've been providing the last couple of months. So it's really a shout out to our service providers who when you need them and be 7/24, 365, they're there and it really paid off for us. Samad Samana : And then maybe just on 100 million of loans that have been processed by the partners that you mentioned, is there -- is Paychex -- how are you monetizing that? Is there a referral fee that Paychex gets, is there -- is it just a service you're providing to your customers? How should we think about the path of monetization for that? Martin Mucci : Yes, it's not large, but we get a referral fee based on a loan that is established. And it's I'd say a relatively small amount given our revenue and so forth, very small amount given our revenue and so forth, but it was more of a service to our clients because a number of small businesses don't necessarily have relationships with banks. And what we were hearing from our clients is that, hey, I don't really have a relationship with a bank and I can't get to the front of the line. And so we partnered with those three fintech companies and obviously it was a need that was out there and provided a support to them. So small monetary value, but significant client service I\u2019d say. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : I think Marty and Efrain, you talked about the second half, obviously being better than the first half. And as we look at the business and Efrain as you're modeling it, is that based on kind of what you're seeing in terms of bookings and kind of what you're seeing in your stats, or is that more based on just the experience that you guys have in this business and your expectations for how the business will trend? Efrain Rivera : I think it's a little bit of both part. So I think that obviously when we started this whole journey several months ago, we have had idea from what a recovery looks like once you hit bottom. When we got to mid May we said, hey, we have hit bottom. And how we're looking at how this progresses, I would say is behave pretty similarly to once we understood the depth of the drop, how we expected it to continue. Now, what we're looking at monitoring as I said before, we have eight to nine weeks of steadily improving metrics. We now are looking for a continuation. I think there've been a number of calls on -- questions on the call, does the -- spread of the infection and some closures, is that having an impact on results? We don't see it yet. But of course we're monitoring that very carefully, but if current trends continue and again they don't necessarily -- it's not necessarily that they will, we think that the way we've laid out the year makes a lot of sense.  So, that continued improvement both on bookings, which we expect over the next several quarters, record high levels of retention are positive in environment where the value of our services provide, our technology and our services provide, has some ability to win in the marketplace. All of those things we think are going to build to the outlook that we've got, and we're optimistic about the remainder of the year. Kartik Mehta : Efrain, one of the more controversial numbers out there right now is the unemployment rate. And as you look at that rate, do you try to compare it to your business? And is there a way to say, where the employment rate has to be to hit the numbers you think you can in the second half? Efrain Rivera : Well, I think we certainly expect that there's going to be improvement starting certainly in the fall. So, I think we're in an environment where we're seeing the same levels of elevated unemployment in mid-fall. I think that we'll have another conversation about what the impact of that is on plan. It's too early to call that. But -- and even economists disagree as to where things really are. I would say, we look at that. We're informed by that, Kartik. But really we're informed by our own data. We can tell week-by-week, frankly daily, if we want to, how much people are paying employees. We know what the trend has been, we know what the recovery from the depths of the shock to where we are right now, and those trends are positive. Now, again, there is no guarantee that that will continue, but we feel that what we believe looking at the data that, it looks like we're on a solid trend. Martin Mucci : Yes. I think Efrain makes a great point. It's one piece of data. But there's so much noise in that unemployment number, particularly because it's kind of state -- with a state-by-state way procedures and the way they pull those numbers together, it's pretty dicey. We have a great sense. I think even our small business index can -- as we got into it, could see -- and I think ADPs as well, there's issues with those kind of the data and the way you look at it as we saw last month with some of these numbers, just because of the way that they're done, nothing was really set up for a shock like this and the way it dropped so quickly. And if you look at our index, it was pretty flat month-to-month, our small business index, and then if you looked at paid employees though, and the way they were measured, they were actually up 4%. And would have been an improvement of 4%. So, you try to look at a lot of data, but as Efrain said, we have a lot of very good data these days on what's changing and where it's changing and how quickly. So, we tend to rely more on our own than something like that. Kartik Mehta : And then just one last question, Marty. As you've entered this environment, how are you managing, investing in the business, yet maintaining operating margins where you're satisfied with the results? Martin Mucci : Well, Kartik, it's always a challenge. But I think, even when you go back to tax reform and you look at what happened there, some companies took that right to the bottom-line. We worked with the Board to reinvest a substantial part of that back some into the employees, but also into the development and those IT investments as we look back now, really were the right things to do that put positioned us very well for remote workers, more self service, online, things like our products we've rolled out here with HR Connect that allow clients to talk to their employees virtually through the app and be able to do electronic signatures. So, we're looking to continue that investment. We made some small number of reductions here in force. But like I said, it was under 2%. And when you look at IT development, that has continued to grow really overall the development side of IT and we've always had savings over the last frankly 10 years or 11 years. We've invested them in IT development to be a real tech generated service company. And that has paid off well. So that will continue. Our capitalized -- our capital, our investments look to be the same as last year. We're not looking to cut IT investments in the product that we're making. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien- tsin Huang : The bookings question. I know a lot of people have asked about it already. But can we just clarify, how did bookings or new sales come in for fiscal '20 versus expectations? And then as you looked at fiscal '21, how different is that going to be? Because it sounds like we shouldn't assume a lot of your new business starts retention which should be higher less a switching. So is it going to be more selling into existing? Just trying to understand big picture what bookings might look like. And how it will differ from last year? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think I'll start. And I think through nine months, I think Efrain even mentioned, we look pretty good. And we were pretty solid in our growth across pretty much all business lines and through the nine months. And then as March -- middle of March, into March and in April and May, a lot of that was just dried up and we were down. Yet, when we look back at the fourth quarter I was amazed at the number of units that we had continued to sell. And the strength frankly was -- a lot of the strength was SurePayroll which can be sold -- pretty much all of it's sold online or over the telephone and they did very well and continued very well in the fourth quarter. I think that was the issue of where not only were they getting a lot of halo effect from the things that we were doing and what was available online. But also more client -- more prospects moving to an outsourcer on a small and on a micro basis. The mid-market through the nine months was very strong. Mid-market, the product -- all the product changes we've introduced have done very well. They certainly hurt a little in the fourth quarter because more of that is face-to-face. But I think they\u2019ve really kind of maneuvered and learned how to sell online and -- very quickly. And then we've given them a lot of support and they've done well. In the first quarter, we kind of expect the improvements that we're leaving fourth quarter with to kind of continue in the first. So it's not going to be a banner first quarter because everyone is still remote. But we have learned a lot of tricks of selling remotely and how to do better scheduling, how to do better remote, how to meet with a client if they want to be met with. And that is all kind of picking up steam. So I think first quarter would be okay. And then we think it'll continue to pick up from there. But through the first nine months, we had solid bookings. And we're pretty excited about those. If that helps. Tien- tsin Huang : It does. So as we look forward and spin around to margins, just looking at the guidance, I appreciate the first half, second half dynamics. But it looks like at least initially, we'll see margins -- your implied margin guide suggests that pretty much all of the declined revenue is going through here to EBITDA. I know you have the savings or the payback from the geo shrinkage here. But is there anything else that's impacting margin beyond just the decremental margins of revenue? These are all my questions. I don't know if I asked that well. Efrain Rivera : Yes, thanks Tien-tsin. So yes, it's primarily revenue driven. And the impacts on a specific quarter are very highly dependent on the amount of revenue in that quarter. And in Q1 we have more as you mentioned of a flow through of the margin impact. And then the revenue starts to build as you go through that, you see less of it and you also see some of the other cost savings initiatives take hold as we go through the year. So yes, you're getting -- that's primarily what you're getting. And again, I\u2019d just go back to one thing that I mentioned. One of the things that we were very careful about is we didn't want to come out of this shock in a weaker state, because we thought, we needed -- we were going to be in a position where there was going to be opportunity in the back half of the year, and we were going to rebound. So rather than cutting significant amount of headcount in the first half of the year, what we decided, as Marty said, is to optimize the amount of headcount that we have. So you'll see benefits as we go through the year from the actions that we're taking. But in Q1, you have a significant hit to margins because of the flow through the revenue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Mark Marcon : Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Just wanted to follow on with regards to the bookings. Could you just -- obviously April and May would have been down because of COVID. But by the time we got to June as things started to stabilize, the bookings, how did they compare relative to a year ago? Like what -- were they trending at 90% of prior year or 80%? How would you characterize the level of improvement? Martin Mucci : Well, I think what we would say -- and frankly when you look at the whole year, we were fairly flat with last year, for the whole fiscal year. So I don't want to portray April and May is too negative. They obviously were down substantially. But when you put it all together, we were probably flattish for the year and down slightly for overall products sold. And if you look at June, you see a sequential improvement over April and May, it\u2019s just -- it's still down, of course over June of last year, when you've got all your sales folks out and you can't -- it's hard. The hardest thing is, frankly, reaching prospects and people to get their attention and so forth. I do think that'll come back as businesses stabilize and get back open. And people kind of feel like there's more of a new normal, we will have -- that will continue to pick up, but we're expecting the first quarter will be certainly down from first quarter of last year. You just don't have the same environment yet. Mark Marcon : And then, so the budgeting for this year, are you anticipating that the salesforce will basically stay flat or would it be -- would that be part of the optimization as well and potentially be a little bit more compact? Martin Mucci : No, I think it's fairly flat overall numbers. It's just we've shifted a little bit more to inside selling and telephonic selling, because it's been working well. And -- but overall, I would say the headcount numbers are about the same across the board. We didn't look -- initially think that we needed to grow the salesforce, but I would say it's roughly about the same number. We didn't really go down either. Efrain Rivera : Yes, Mark, just a little color to the point that Marty is making. What we found was in making that shift, you actually could get better productivity. And so it did not equate to the fact that we couldn't drive a higher sales activity even though headcount was relatively flat year-over-year, because of really a tremendous amount of work that we've done on the digital marketing side and also on our ability to sell, as Marty said, virtually. We really are just in a different ballgame now than we were two, three years ago. And so, you can operate with less field-based salespeople and more virtual and drive higher levels of activity. Mark Marcon : And then, Marty, you made a comment early in the discussion about how a lot of people perceived you as a small business payroll company but you've actually migrated clients up in terms of size and service level. I'm wondering if you could dimensionalize that to a greater extent like if we think about where Paychex was a couple of years ago, where you are today and where you think Paychex is going to be a few years from now, just in terms of client size, number of services that the average client takes on. How would you dimensionalize that? Martin Mucci : Well, I think Mark, if you look sort of at a high level, the company -- the revenues have doubled in the last 10 years now. So we hit $4 billion, and that was -- our goal was to be over $4 billion. We're not going to exactly hold it unfortunately for a few months. But we hit $4 billion, up from $2 billion 10 years ago. If you now look at the distribution of that revenue, you can see that it has moved, when we were back kind of payroll and HRS before we shifted to Management Solutions and PEO, payroll had fallen below 50% for the first time maybe a year or so ago. And if you look at it now, I think the PEO business is 25 PEO and insurance is 25% of the business. It's continually growing, and the payroll side is shifting, payroll and other things and Management Solutions. And I think that, that just shows that historically, we've taken the company from what was predominantly small business payroll, and the mid-market is growing faster now, and we had a couple of years where that wasn't growing as well. Last couple of years that has really picked up speed, even with more competition. We've got more products, much more of a technology company and a lot more self-service. And when you look at the size of the offerings from learning management, to pay on demand, to HR Connection and the mobility app being a five star app, I think it's just -- the company is much more a technology and mid-market -- small and mid-market company. We're not going to leave small, but mid market is going to become a much faster growing, and the PEO and HR side has certainly been a much faster and growing business.  So when I think of Paychex, as the original question, out five years, sometimes our brand is still -- obviously having been in business almost 50 years, the brand is still -- oh, yes, they are a small business payroll company. Well, that's really not true. We're much more of a HR company, and the PEO-ASO insurances that we offer is a fast-growing piece of the business. It's now, as I said, just in our financials, 25% of the revenue. And so, I hope that helps. I mean that's kind of how I see it dimensioning, and HR -- the definition of HR has changed quite dramatically and also will change dramatically now with COVID and what that means. And I think we're well positioned to support that changing definition and need for clients of a larger size. I don't think we're going to -- we're not going to leave the small business. That's still a great opportunity to continue to grow. But that 20 to 100 in particular has really picked up steam for what they need, and the revenue per client has obviously picked up as well, as they\u2019ve bought more products for their -- to be competitive with each other as clients in their markets. Mark Marcon : And then, can I just ask one last small detail question? Just with regards to the first half guidance and particularly the first quarter guidance as it relates to the PEO side for down high-single-digit to low-double-digit, part of that is just a function of the reduced salaries that the worksite employees are getting, correct? Efrain Rivera : That's correct. That's part of it. Yes, you got it, Mark. Yes, that's correct. Mark Marcon : And so, when we're thinking about it more from a unit perspective, it would be more muted than that? Efrain Rivera : Yes, much more muted than that. You're right. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen with Citi. Pete Christiansen : Thank you for fitting me in. I have two connected questions. From your multi-location client employers, are you seeing any footprint shrinkage there? And then, there was one article last week in the journal, I think, was speaking more to the enterprise side that some furloughs are turning more into permanent headcount reductions. The basis of the two questions is really to ask if you are seeing in the early signs secondary impacts from the weaker economy. Are you starting to see flow through some of your KPIs? Martin Mucci : Yes. With the first one, I don't think like in multi-state employers, we really have not seen that. I haven't seen anything that stands out that -- so that they are reducing their footprint yet. That is not a majority of our clients, certainly. But we have not seen any trend yet. I wouldn't necessarily be surprised if more are like we're doing, reducing our physical footprint and having more work from home and so forth, but -- and that's certainly wouldn't surprise me, but we haven't seen much of a trend there. And then, the second question, Efrain was... Efrain Rivera : Can you repeat that second one? Sorry. Pete Christiansen : Sure. Yes, it was about furloughs turning to more permanent headcount reductions, yes. Martin Mucci : Yes, I'm sorry. Haven't seen that yet, although the checks are down. So, as we've talked about, we're seeing an improvement in checks, checks that -- we are seeing an improvement from the decrease in checks. So -- but the checks are still down. So yes, there's fewer checks. Have they -- are they furloughed employees or permanently out? I think it's a little bit too early to see that yet. Efrain, anything -- I don't know if you have anything\u2026. Efrain Rivera : No, I would just say, Pete, that what we saw early on was that small businesses and mid-sized businesses tend to make -- take an action on an employee initially and then hire back as opposed to keep them furloughed. I think in the enterprise space, you probably see more furlough action than we see in our client base. And the trends -- as Marty was saying earlier, the trends we've been seeing are the opposite, which is we've seen people adding back at this point as opposed to reducing. And so it's buried in that number, but that number is looking more positive. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Martin Mucci : Okay, thank you. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 30 days. I do thank you on behalf of Efrain and I. Thank you for your time to participate on our fourth quarter and year-end press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day, and please stay safe. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now hand the call over to Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer to begin. Please go ahead, sir. Martin Mucci : Great, thank you, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of our Paychex first quarter of fiscal year 2021 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2020. You can access the earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet, will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start today\u2019s call with an update on the business highlights for the first quarter. Efrain will review our first quarter financial results and provide an update on fiscal \u201821 and then we will open it up for your questions. Fiscal \u201821 is off to a good start. Although the impacts of COVID-19 continue to affect our results causing unfavorable year-over-year comparisons, our first quarter results finished better than originally projected as most of our key business metrics recovered at a faster rate than anticipated. Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, our business model has proven resilient. We have seen good sales momentum, excellent client retention and accelerated product development responsive to the needs of our clients. We also rapidly reduced discretionary costs where needed to protect margins and are ahead of schedule on a number of initiatives to reduce long-term costs as well. We are pleased with our sales performance during the first quarter, which reflected new annualized revenue significantly higher than our expectations. Growth in new payroll sales units was strong year-over-year reflecting the highest fiscal quarter growth in over 5 years. Our investments over the past several years in virtual sales, digital marketing and lead generation, and sales support technologies have positioned us well to succeed in this environment. With the challenges small and midsized businesses have faced during this environment, our HR value proposition has never been more clear. We have seen a surge in demand for our various HR offerings since the beginning of COVID, and our Q1 sales results for our HR services division were very strong with double-digit increase over last year. We are well-positioned to continue to take advantage of this opportunity. Our client retention during the first quarter has remained at record levels. We continue to see payroll clients that have been in non-processing status beginning to pay employees again. Throughout this crisis, we have been very proactive in providing information, tools, and guidance to our clients. We are proud of our response supporting our clients during this crisis. We work closely with regulatory agencies to both remain informed and advocate for our clients. Our compliance and software development teams worked quickly to interpret and respond to the changing regulations and design products to assist our clients through one of the most challenging times for the business community. We have provided real-time updates and solutions compliant with new regulations. We were first to market with a PPP loan forgiveness estimator, which now produces a signature ready application. Recently, Wolters Kluwer, a leading national provider of tax and accounting expertise, selected our PPP loan forgiveness estimator to be utilized by their CCH AnswerConnect research platform subscribers. Since launching in early April, we have approximately 300,000 unique visitors to our COVID-19 Help Center. Our COVID-related training has seen strong participation with some webinars attracting over 10,000 attendees. Along with the investments we have made in our platforms that have allowed us to adapt and maintain high levels of service delivery, our thought leadership has helped in achieving our record client satisfaction. Investments in technology combined with personalized client service that Paychex is known for, available 7/24/365 has served us well in the current environment due to the adaptability and speed of delivery. We have seen sessions during the quarter utilizing our mobile platform increase double digits compared to the prior-year period and the number of active employees on the platform continues to increase. Our clients and their employees have been taking advantage of Flex for self service, self service utilization by client employees as a percentage of total utilization is at an all-time high given the remote working environment for many of our clients, and Paychex learning enrollments are also significantly benefiting from virtual training offerings that users can participate in from any location. We recently introduced new employee health and safety in the workplace features in Paychex Flex. These features include COVID-19 leave of absence tracking through HR Connect for employees who request leave to care for a family member or child attending school virtually COVID-19 screening for when employees come back to the physical work environment and a health attestation solution that allows employers to collect employee information in a variety of ways. These features combined with our HR Connect and conversations features, Iris scan clocks, pay-on-demand capabilities, and other product functionality will continue to prove invaluable to our clients, whether their employees continue to work remotely or as they prepare for returning their employees to an office environment. As mentioned in June, we have accelerated certain long-term cost saving initiatives, including reducing our physical office footprint, and And during the first quarter, we recognized $31 million in one-time costs related to these initiatives, and we are progressing better than expected. We anticipate that we will fully realize our projected savings from these initiatives. We are proud that both the strength of our technology as well as the care we give our customers has been recognized by industry experts. Most recently, the Paychex Flex platform was recognized by Lighthouse Research and Advisory with an HR Tech Award for the Best SMB focused solution in the Core HR/Workforce category. The combination of a single device independent application with human resource services and benchmarking capabilities sets us apart from others in this category. We have also been recognized with a 2020 Tech Cares Award presented by TrustRadius, which celebrates companies that have gone above and beyond to provide their communities and clients with support during the COVID-19 pandemic. I am also very proud to note that for the tenth straight year, we have been recognized as the largest provider of 401(k) record-keeping services by the number of plans by Plansponsor Magazine. We have a longstanding commitment to leveraging innovative technology solutions like Paychex Flex and best-in-class service to simplify the often complex task of saving for retirement and are proud to continue to help business owners and employees safer retirement during these challenging times. Irrespective of the pace and speed of recovery, our resilient business model, strong liquidity position, and dedicated employees will allow us to come through this stronger, while continuing to provide industry-leading technology solutions and outstanding service to our clients. I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results for the first quarter. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Marty and good morning everyone. I want to start by saying I hope that everyone is safe and your families are doing well and our best wishes go out to those who have been impacted by the by the pandemic. Let me remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward-looking statements you know all that stuff refer to future events, etcetera, look at the customary disclosures and then I am going to refer to non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA, same things, please refer to the press release for the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures. Let me start by providing some of the key points for the quarter and then follow-up with greater detail in certain areas and then wrap with our fiscal 2021 outlook. First quarter results reflect the impact of economic conditions resulting from COVID-19. As Marty mentioned, for the first quarter, total revenue declined 6% to $932 million largely due to lower volume impacting revenue across our HCM solutions. During our June earnings call, I had noted the first quarter revenue was anticipated to be down high single-digits to low double-digits. Obviously looking at this, our results exceeded those expectations. Total service revenue moderated 6% to $917 million. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue declined 5% to $687 million and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue decreased 7% to $230 million, when I say total service revenue moderating, I mean, declined. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 28% for the quarter to $15 million due to lower average investment balances and lower average interest rates earned. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients declined 6% during the quarter primarily due to the impact of lower checks per client due to COVID. Expenses were up 1% to $650 million, but when you exclude the one-time costs of $31 million that Marty mentioned, we were actually down 4% driven by lower discretionary spending and cost control measures implemented in Q4. We are very proud of how we managed expenses through this entire period. Operating income increased \u2013 decreased, I am sorry, 19% to $284 million and reflected an operating margin of 30.5%. Again, that was ahead of expectations, adjusted operating income excluding the impact of one-time costs decreased 10% to $315 million reflected in adjusted operating margin of 33.8%. Other expense net for the first quarter that includes interest on long-term borrowings partially offset by corporate investment income, which as you know, is quite low and was impacted by lower rates. Our effective income tax rate was 23.4% for the first quarter compared to 23.3% for the same period last year. Both periods reflect tax benefits for stock-based comp payments that occur with the vesting of various annual stock rewards. Net income decreased 20% to $212 million, but adjusted net income decreased 11% to $228 million. For the quarter, adjusted net income includes one-time costs in the tax benefit from stock comp payments. We have pulled that out we have discuss this all the time. There is just no way to know in a given quarter whether people are going to exercise or not, we can give you guesstimate, but don\u2019t know it ended up providing some benefits in the quarter. Diluted earnings per share declined 19% to $0.59 for the quarter, but adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 11% to $0.63, reasons I cited above. Investments and income. As you know, our primary goal is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. Long-term portfolio currently had an average yield of about 2% average duration of 3.3% or 3.3 years. Combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.3% for the quarter, down from 2% last year. I will now walk through highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $952 million. Funds held for clients as of August 31, 2020 were $3.3 billion compared to $3.4 billion. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.5 billion for the first quarter. Total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $117 million as of August 31, 2020 compared with $100 million as of May 31, 2020. The increase in net gain position as you can surmise resulted from declines in interest rates. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $2.8 billion, reflecting $223 million in dividend paid and $29 million of shares repurchased during the quarter. Our return on equity for the past 12 months remains robust at 39%. Cash flows from operations were $215 million for the first quarter, a decrease of over 20% from the same period last year. The decrease was driven by lower net income and fluctuations in working capital. Now, let me turn to fiscal guidance \u2013 fiscal 2021 guidance for the current year, which ends as you know on May 31, 2021. The outlook reflects our current thinking regarding the speed and timing of the economic recovery. First quarter results as you can see exceeded expectation. There is uncertainty about the trajectory of recovery over the next several quarters. Our guidance assumes a steady, but gradual improvement through the rest of the fiscal year. We have provided the following updates to the guidance after seeing first quarter results. Management Solutions revenue is now expected to decline in the range of 1% to 3%. We have previously guided to a decline in the range of 1% to 4% and we will continue to update as each quarter passes. PEO and Insurance Services revenue is expected to decline in the range of 2% to 5%. Our previous guidance was a decline in the range of 2% to 7%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be between $55 million and $65 million. Total revenue is expected to decline in the range of 2% to 4%. We have previously guided to a decline in the range of 2% to 5%. Adjusted operating income, as a percent of total revenue, is now anticipated to be approximately 35%, up from previous guidance of 34% to 35%. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the full year fiscal 2021, is expected to be approximately 40%, up from 39% to 40%. Other expense net anticipated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2021 is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, is expected to decline in the range of 6% to 8%. We have previously guided to a decline in the range of 6% to 10%. Turning to the second quarter, we currently anticipate Management Solutions revenue will decline in the range of 2% to 3% and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue will decline 4% to 6%. Adjusted operating margins, excluding one-time costs, are anticipated to be in the range of 34% to 35%. An early view of the second half of the year and I just want to mention something, when all of this started, many people withdrew guidance. And we walked in and we told you what we thought. We didn\u2019t get it completely right at first, but we communicated and updated you in the middle of the quarter to tell you where things were changing. So, we will continue. We are committed to full transparency. And we are committed to updating you on a regular basis. So, investors know exactly what we are thinking, when we think it. This is what we are thinking right now. Of course, things can change as we go through the year. But at this point, the early view of the second half of the year, we anticipate total revenue will be in the range of flat to very low single-digits. Operating margins, we anticipate to be approximately 37%. Of course, as I said, all of this is subject to current assumptions, which are subject to change. We will update you again on our second quarter call. So, we are more positive than we were at the at the June call. Obviously, everyone knows the uncertainty you are dealing with. I would say just a couple of more things to conclude my comments. Number one is I think what you saw in first quarter and Marty alluded to it, is the strength of digital solutions. Digital and virtual sales were up very, very strong in the quarter. And when I say very strong, I don\u2019t mean 10 and I don\u2019t mean 20, I mean, it was very strong. Obviously, any sale that dependent on face-to-face meetings was more challenging, but we have been gaining momentum there. That\u2019s number one. Number two, HR solutions was up very strong from a sales standpoint and revenue recovery has been strong in the quarter stronger than we anticipated. So, when you look at digital-based, digital marketing and sales, we had a really good quarter. When you look at HR solutions, we had a very good quarter and that is part of what\u2019s driving or being incrementally positive as we go through the year. And PEO, I would say this, one of the things that we have learned as the year has gone on, is that while PEO had a sharp downturn initially, we have seen a sharp recovery also. And so we are incrementally again more positive on PEO. That solution is important in the market, and we think there will be \u2013 continue to be a good demand. Now, obviously, there is still a lot of uncertainty in the environment. But as I said, on the second half, we think we are in a position to manage through it and have taken all of the right steps in the short-term and we took a lot of the right steps in the long-term to direct investments to where we were, had we not done that, we would be in a different position. This is not your father\u2019s Paychex. With that, I will turn it back to Marty. Martin Mucci : Okay, thank you, Efrain. And we will now \u2013 operator, we will open it up for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask Efrain about your \u2013 or Marty as well, the last comments you had on digital and just get your view in terms of how you mentioned, it\u2019s not your father\u2019s Paychex, how permanent do you think some of the shifts are in your business when it comes to things like digital versus analog from, I guess a product standpoint as well as a sales technology standpoint? Is this more of a blip or is this something do you think will kind of fundamentally change the fabric as we go forward? Martin Mucci : Yes, I will start and then I will let Efrain jump in on anything that I miss or comment that he has. Look, I think it\u2019s permanent. I also think, as I think everyone has seen things have accelerated quite dramatically with the environment of work-from-home employees, and so a lot of things are the mobile adoption, the use of the look for paperless, everything being paperless from recruiting, to on-boarding, to training, to any change that employee makes is all, we could see all that coming in and had invested in it, as many had, but it has really accelerated with the remote workforces and I think it\u2019s definitely permanent even if employees come back to the office, many will return to the office or a similar environment, and I think that\u2019s never going to change. I think people are just used to it. Also the way they are buying, which is much more virtual, as Efrain commented, the results have been very strong from a -- we are a self-service basically, where they are going online and doing the search for us, which we have invested in looking at demos, which we have invested in, and then buying themselves online through SurePayroll or Flex have both been very strong as Efrain mentioned. And I do think it\u2019s because we have invested well in a product that is simple to use, easy to sign up for, and that\u2019s working very well. So, I think it\u2019s very permanent, all the way through from paperless, to remote, to the mobility app, and everything else in between. So, we feel very well-positioned from a permanent going forward standpoint. Efrain Rivera : Yes. What I would add is it\u2019s one thing to say, hey, we had great digital sales progress in the quarter. And by that, I mean, not only SurePayroll where we can as Marty mentioned, you can search and onboard yourself in payroll without having anyone involved in the process. That was something we did several years ago, but also our virtual selling efforts that are powered by our digital marketing efforts have been really, really strong too. But all of that needs to be tied together with a digital service model, and I think as Marty was mentioning, we have made a lot of investments on that side. You heard his comments about the number of employees who are actually utilizing our platform to do, to connect and update their information. And so, sometimes we hear this narrative like somehow, the only people in the market that can do that are certain competitors and it\u2019s just interesting, let me put it that way. It isn\u2019t true, but it\u2019s interesting. And we have been making quietly many of the same changes and you can\u2019t compete now in the market. 10 years ago, if you weren\u2019t SaaS, you weren\u2019t -- we were going to be left behind, and now if you are not pivoting to digital, you are going to be left behind too and we understand that. Martin Mucci : I am sorry, Efrain, I wanted to say the other stat that\u2019s been so interesting is we\u2019ve talked about our Flex Assistant, which is basically a chatbot that answers questions coming in from clients. 50% of the questions are now being answered by the chatbot, and it\u2019s the use of that is just incredible, and it has saved us a lot from a service perspective, from a people perspective, and what they can focus on. So, our team is always available as I said, the only one that\u2019s available 7/24/365 from a personal service if you need it, and now those people are freed up more than ever for the more value-added questions. So, we feel like the investments we have made are really paying off and it\u2019s accelerated and will be permanent as a result of this pandemic environment. Ramsey El-Assal: Great. That\u2019s terrific. One more for me, I wanted to ask another question about how the business is sort of evolving in the context of the pandemic. Can you speak to kind of the relative importance of cross-selling to existing customers versus signing up new ones in terms of your kind of your growth algorithm now? Is the model more reliant today on expanding to the wallet share of existing clients, or is it sort of business as usual, how would you kind of characterize that balance? Martin Mucci : I would say it\u2019s fairly business as usual. I mean, we are selling into the base well. I think the clients, the more satisfied the clients are with the existing services they have, obviously the more open they are to talking to us. We have expanded our product set quite dramatically and we have new technology advancements that are coming out all the time, and we have quite a package of services that will help in the pandemic. I think one of the things that during this pandemic is that COVID Help Center has really driven a lot of clients in to see how valuable. You know, when clients need you most is when they see the greatest value and they have really seen great value in what we have offered and what they have been able to access from information. You know when you think about the payroll report that we produced, the same day that the loans were available, we were the first to put out the payroll report that\u2019s been accessed and downloaded over a 0.5 million times now, and now the loan forgiveness estimator, no one has got a better estimator and now signature-ready application to be able to get your loan forgiven, those kinds of things have added a lot of value to clients and therefore our client retention has never been stronger. No one is leaving to go to any competitor that are using those kind of tools because they found them so valuable. So, I think the process of selling additional features are being helped by that, and I think certain things we even saw a big drop in the fourth quarter of last year in retirement sales, because people weren\u2019t focused on retirement, that has come back strong in the first quarter. So, people who were payroll clients or a payroll in HR now look for retirement and retirement actually increased year-over-year from a sales and revenue perspective. So, I think the ability to sell other services has really improved through the pandemic because of the value we have offered. Ramsey El-Assal: That\u2019s terrific. I appreciate your answers. Thanks so much for taking the question. Martin Mucci : Alright. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning, Marty and Efrain. I appreciate you are giving guidance in environment, where many companies are not. I am wondering if you could flesh out your thinking a little bit more, Efrain on FY \u201821, you are pointing to the top half of your previous guidance ranges, but it seems like a lot of the metrics that you have called out in terms of record 5-year growth and new payroll sales, double-digit growth in HR sales, highest client retention ever, might actually point to a stronger result for FY \u201821? Are there \u2013 are you are you just uncertain if we get another wave of fiscal stimulus or maybe a little more detail around how you are thinking about outcomes for FY \u201821? And then maybe why not \u2013 maybe why not a little stronger given all the leading indicators are really off the charts? Efrain Rivera : Hi, not quite off the chart, that would be good. But yes, so David, I think just a few things on that, one is we feel pretty good that first half is going to be better than what we expected. It was big. So, you don\u2019t win a game in the first half, but it certainly is good to be up several touchdowns before the before the half end. So, we think first half is going to be strong. Having said that, a lot of it depends as you suggest on the back half of the year and fourth quarter is going to be very important. Through Q3, we see results being still muted, because that\u2019s a big quarter and we are comparing against a quarter before all of the pandemic effects occurred. So there is a note of caution and what we have if we could \u2013 if we projected the lines we see now we would have different guidance, but we don\u2019t do that, because it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not a accurate or it\u2019s not a forecast we would be very comfortable providing, but we think a lot of the metrics are pointing in the right direction. And certainly from where we were in the June timeframe, things look better. We are not anticipating another stimulus. If it comes, that would be great. We think that as Marty said in other interviews, we think the stimulus did help. It provided a cushion for the blow for a lot of small and medium-sized businesses, but we are not assuming that it\u2019s better. And we don\u2019t assume that there is going to be a dramatic improvement in unemployment over the next several quarters. So, that dictates some caution in terms of what we provide, but the environment is better than or we started the year better than we than we anticipated with recovery in a number of areas coming faster than we thought. David Togut : Got it. Just as a quick follow-up, are there any constraints on your ability to implement these record new sales in the payroll services business, I mean, what\u2019s the timeline to implement the strong new book of business? Martin Mucci : Well, I think what selling season will be is coming up actually starting in the mid-market of this month, I think probably the only thing that\u2019s going to be the most challenging is getting two clients, some clients are still delaying decisions, particularly in that mid-market to be a little bit careful. We are making sales. We are getting out now to meet with clients if they want to meet. This has all been done really remotely for the last two quarters. And so to have the sales that we have even in a remote selling environment has been pretty impressive and I think we have honed kind of new skills on being able to do that. So, I think probably the biggest challenge to hitting results would be continuing, those results would just be getting access to the client and the client being comfortable to make a decision based on their business and whether they are ready, but right now, we feel good in the small business in particular, in the small business market. I think that\u2019s continuing to expand. So not only do I think we have taken a little share, but we have also seen the pie get larger, because more businesses, small businesses in particular that have not outsourced before, we are seeing them outsource payroll for the \u2013 payroll at least, if not payroll and HR for the first time. And so that market, I think is growing as well given kind of the complexities of the environment and so forth and they are seeing the value of being with a payroll provider, for example, to help them get the loans, to help them get the loans forgiven, to work through all of the complicated regulations that are changing and so forth. David Togut : Understood. Thank you very much. Martin Mucci : Okay, David. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : Hey, thanks, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to start with a clarification. Efrain, just on the second half outlook, did you say that revenue should be flat to up total reps? Efrain Rivera : Yes, flat to up very low single-digits. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, okay. Now, last quarter, were we talking up low single, I know, it\u2019s not much of a difference, but I just wanted to see if I have that nuance, right and is this just kind of a timing thing where the recovery happened a little sooner. So, the year is a little bit more balanced than you might have thought otherwise? Efrain Rivera : When you say last quarter, Jason, what are you referring to up sequentially or the previous quarter\u2026 Jason Kupferberg : No, last quarter when you gave us guidance and you broke down the first half and the second half, I thought at that point in time, the second half was expected to be up low single-digits. Efrain Rivera : No, I didn\u2019t say low single-digits for second half that wouldn\u2019t have been correct. So, I would have to look at what I said, but no, we haven\u2019t said that, no, no. And Jason, just to provide some clarification, we still expect at this point, third quarter is going to be down versus the prior quarter with growth and then growth more significant growth in fourth quarter. No, I don\u2019t think, we might have said, but I won\u2019t speculate on what we said the transcript will say what we said. But if we said something that indicated we were going to be positive in the back half that our second half, that wouldn\u2019t have been correct. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, okay. Fair enough. And just a question on the margin front, how should we think about the long-term implications obviously for your cost structure, real estate, sales force customer support, etcetera, I mean, is there anyway to quantify that at this point or at some point in the not too distant future, perhaps? Efrain Rivera : Probably in the not too distant future, not this second. But I think the question you are asking if I can ask a question or answer a question you are not asking, look, there is a range of initiatives that Marty was mentioning the speed with which we did the footprint rationalization, it doesn\u2019t take \u2013 it doesn\u2019t take too much to, too many assumptions to think that we can\u2019t continue to evolve that model so that you need less space than you currently do and address costs in that way. So, we will look at that. We are not ready to commit to what that number looks like at this point, but we have had good experience thus far. And I think the acceleration of our other digital efforts suggests that we can at least control costs in that area and maybe get more efficient as we go along. But we will talk more about that in future calls. Jason Kupferberg : And maybe just one last one on the back of the strong sales performance you just saw, can you just talk about the trends you are seeing in terms of new business creation and your overall win rates? Martin Mucci : Yes, sure. I mean, we are certainly seeing as I think just generally in the economy, new business startups are up 20% year-over-year. It\u2019s pretty incredible and I think what we are seeing \u2013 what you see and we see it on new businesses is people are shifting. So people are getting out of some businesses, shifting to others or evolving their business and others are seeing opportunities in this environment that they didn\u2019t see before. So new business startups are really growing, and I think we are getting a good share of those, because of the investments we have made, where it\u2019s easy to sign up, it\u2019s a very full featured product, whether you go to Sure or whether you need Flex. And so I think, new business startups and that is our helping. And then I think existing businesses, as I mentioned that are now outsourcing, that we are doing payroll and HR themselves have found that it\u2019s time to outsource to someone like Paychex that can deliver great value to them and really protect them \u2013 help protect them in an environment that is changing so rapidly with all of the regulations and the benefits and what employees are looking for, from them as well. Jason Kupferberg : Alright. Well, thanks for the comments, guys. Martin Mucci : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Wald of Morgan Stanley. Steven Wald : Hey, good morning. Thanks for providing all the continued guidance through all this. We do appreciate it. I was hoping to start off just by sharpening the pencils on a few items that you guys have been talking around specifically, I think \u2013 I don\u2019t think I missed it, but an actual retention number for the quarter, I think you said 83% last quarter, but it included an adjustment for businesses that were suspended. And then if you could maybe walk us through how you are thinking about year end \u2013 fiscal year end unemployment rate assumptions and business failure rates from here? Martin Mucci : Yes, I would say, on the client retention, we really give it once a year, but we are still at the highest levels of retention we had. So even \u2013 and I would say that of those \u2013 Steven, the numbers that we said that were suspended were probably down three quarters of those from the peak. So, we still have some that have suspended their service, but it\u2019s getting down to a very low number. Now more of those go lost after year end, we are watching that. What we have seen \u2013 really a pretty dramatic decrease from the peak, down to probably a quarter of what we saw. So yes, it could still impact client retention, but it\u2019s a much smaller number than what it was and we will have to see as we get through calendar year end, whether they are kind of hanging on for either more stimulus or to be able to get through year end. But at this point, we have seen a real improvement in that. And I am sorry, what was your other question? Efrain Rivera : The other question is on unemployment. Martin Mucci : Unemployment, it\u2019s hard to say, you know, really that\u2019s just a prediction as to where we are. We have seen what half the jobs come back that that were lost. We definitely see the progress slowing as you see employees come back and being paid. So, we are seeing \u2013 we saw much better improvement in the first quarter than we had expected as we have talked about and that is slowing. It\u2019s still progressing and positive. But the number \u2013 it would be hard to predict kind of where we think that\u2019s going to be. I think it\u2019s going to continue to improve, but at a slower rate than we had. And then I think the hardest prediction is really kind of after the election, what does that do to things. I think that\u2019s why we are a little more cautious in the second half of the year is just saying, hey, we have a pretty good sense of \u2013 obviously of second quarter, but when you see third and fourth, it\u2019s a little bit harder to predict. Efrain Rivera : Yes, we are not pegging our forecast to 7% or 6% or 5% or 4.5% unemployment by Q4. Part the reason for that is the business is more complex than \u2013 excuse me than simply what\u2019s happening with worksite employees or with checks per client. We obviously \u2013 as Marty said expect it to be \u2013 to improve and frankly, the unemployment numbers have been better than we were anticipating originally when we put our plan together. What\u2019s it need to be in Q4 to hit the numbers, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really \u2013 we are not pegging our forecast in that way. So we are looking at a lot of other factors that really have to do with, not only what\u2019s happening on HCM sales, but what\u2019s happening in the rest of the base, which is more than 50% of our revenue. Martin Mucci : Yes. The other thing that\u2019s important to note is we are very diversified in our client base. So, even as this happened, we didn\u2019t \u2013 even though leisure and hospitality in particular took a huge hit as restaurants closed and then reopened partially and so forth. We certainly have plenty of clients in that leisure and hospitality kind of sector, but we are also very spread around into other sectors. And construction and everything around construction has continued to perform quite well from a jobs perspective, particularly in the south and so forth. So we are quite spread out. And so we don\u2019t see if there is any one industry that\u2019s really taken a hit where that doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect in our results. Steven Wald : Completely understood and appreciate the color on all that. Maybe just one quick follow-up, as you were talking about sort of the diversification, I believe the one area where there was maybe like any concentration among your client base was in the PEO space, where it\u2019s more concentrated. I think you mentioned previously in discussions, Florida, Texas, California, just curious what you are seeing on the ground there relative to how you think about the national footprint and whether that sort of just nets out in the wash on the PEO side or if there is any particular areas of strength from obviously a lot of headlines about migration of investment dollars towards low tax states or any of those things, just thoughts on conditions on the ground in those areas? Efrain Rivera : Yes, What we have seen, if you look at it from a worksite employee standpoint in those states is we have seen a pretty sharp recovery certainly in several of those states. I would say California is more volatile of the larger PEO states just as they battled flare-ups with COVID. But we have seen a pretty significant rebound in a lot of those states, not to where they were before pre-COVID, but certainly starting to get up towards those levels. And I think that PEO itself, both if you look at it from a revenue standpoint and the amount of worksite employees that were processing and also on a sales standpoint, we are seeing good results on both ends of that equation, which suggests what the environment is normalizing. Martin Mucci : Yes, Florida as Efrain said that everybody is still down, but Florida is the strongest on our small business index that we track on a monthly basis. Florida has been number one, South has been strong again construction, both residential and commercial has continued to be strong there. So, where we certainly had more concentration in those states, they have been stronger states and insurance rates on top of that have been good. So, the increases in insurance have been pretty, pretty low. So, I think they will continue to have \u2013 we should have continue to have good retention as we go through open enrollment for insurance plans and everything this quarter. Steven Wald : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Martin Mucci : Okay. Efrain Rivera : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Hi, guys. Good morning. Wanted to ask about the change to virtual and e-com, how does it change the revenue per client first? And then secondly, how does it change the margin structure, is there a higher margin inherent in that? Martin Mucci : Interesting. So, I think Bryan, it\u2019s a function of size of clients, so the smaller the client, obviously, the lower the revenue. So, if you are driving a lot of smaller clients tend to be the ones that are \u2013 that use a lot of the e-commerce solutions. So, you get less revenue in that standpoint. On the other hand, from a margin standpoint, sometimes it\u2019s better because there is lower cost to serve. So there is a little bit of a wash, you got to overcome a bit of the sales, the revenue impact, but longer term, it\u2019s still a pretty positive, a positive development. I didn\u2019t catch the second part of that question. And then margin, I just mentioned it margin can be as good or sometimes even better. Bryan Keane : No, that\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s what I would have figured, but wanted to confirm. And then Marty, on your comment, sales performance is accelerating with year-over-year growth in number of clients sold. And I think you talked about a record number of units sold, maybe the highest in 5 years. I was just trying to get a sense of where that was in the trough? How much was client growth down maybe in the trough and then how much is it growing now on a year-over-year basis, just hoping to quantify that impact? Efrain Rivera : Just want to clarify something, Bryan. When Marty said that unit growth was the highest it\u2019s been in 5 years, he is not comparing it in terms of sequential improvement if it was sequential improvement, the number would be even more amazing. But what we are comparing is against the same quarter last year pre-COVID, what we are saying is that our unit growth in the quarter was very high. So, with that, I will let Marty answer the rest of it. Martin Mucci : Yes, because when you\u2019re top of the trough tonight, I think that\u2019s where Efrain picked up, where you are talking about last quarter. We are comparing year-over-year. So, year-over-year first quarter, it\u2019s been the best sales unit growth that we have seen in probably 5 years or maybe even a little bit more. So if that\u2019s what you were asking. So, it\u2019s not compared to how low it got in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s compared to last year first quarter. So we have seen a real pickup in demand as I said, Bryan, from those who didn\u2019t outsource before new business starts and I think taking some share as well and then the client retention being so strong overall has really helped. We don\u2019t talk about net client growth except once a year, but it\u2019s needless to say, when you put that together, you got nice growth. Efrain Rivera : I would say just our digital marketing efforts over the last couple of years have really, really picked up and really been terrific and I think it\u2019s really fueling a lot of those results. Bryan Keane : And going forward, do you think Efrain that it\u2019s \u2013 is it still the 1% to 3% client growth or maybe does this model change a little bit with these kind of new business starts in this e-com model? Efrain Rivera : Yes, it\u2019s still early. I want to \u2013 well, part of me wants to be, draw a line with several points and then kind of extrapolate out. Yes, I want to be cautious about that. There is an element here that we are in an environment where that favors digital solutions. I mean, that\u2019s not a surprise. And Marty answered earlier when he was asked that question, how permanent or durable is it? Certainly, you got to think that there is a portion of this that\u2019s durable and will continue and that you have got to bake that into your model and that there is demand there, which is what Marty was saying. I mean, one of the things that we have seen is that we have seen some indicators that \u2013 some of that demand is coming from companies that didn\u2019t outsource. We also happen to be in an environment, which is counterintuitive where a business formation is better than anyone expected, so very different in some ways from \u201807/08. So we will have to get a couple of more quarters under our belt to get a sense of whether this starts to change that equation a bit. Bryan Keane : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Efrain Rivera : Okay, Bryan. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas of William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. I was just hoping you could speak to trends on the workers\u2019 comp side of late. Have you seen any stabilization rates there or will that continue to be a headwind throughout the rest of the year? Efrain Rivera : I think it will be a bit of a headwind from a revenue standpoint, Andrew, but rates seem to be stabilizing and actually we have seen in some cases been ticking up slightly. So, we think we may have \u2013 we maybe getting towards the bottom of the trough so to speak. That has some impacts obviously on PEO in addition to our insurance broker workers\u2019 comp sales. It seems like we are getting closer to the bottom there. Andrew Nicholas : Got it. Good to hear. Good to hear. And then just a follow-up, I was hoping you could speak a little bit to the M&A opportunity right now, are you still open to doing deals, I would assume so and where do you expect to find those opportunities? And then relatedly, if you have any commentary on kind of what pricing is looking like in those areas that would be helpful? Efrain Rivera : Yes. We are still very open to that and have continued to stay in contact with opportunities and with the banker community and so forth as to what\u2019s available, very interested of course in all the lines of our current business, in particular, so PEO businesses and payroll of course and others. I think, it\u2019s opening up a little bit. I would say valuations are still right up there. I wouldn\u2019t say there was any discounting going on because of COVID. I think it\u2019s difficult \u2013 it\u2019s a little bit still difficult to do due diligence and things like that given limited travel and access. But I think we would be able to work through those if we found the right business. So, yes, we are very open to M&A. Obviously we are very liquid and have a good solid cash position and if we find a good acquisition, we are certainly ready and able to execute on that. Andrew Nicholas : Great, thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin of Cowen. Bryan Bergin : Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask on Management Solutions, I want to understand the mix of your better than expected performance here in 1Q related to the changes in check volume contribution versus some of the new addition momentum you are talking about versus the increased retirement and other services. So, can you just help us understand the mix of the factors that contributed here in 1Q? Efrain Rivera : Yes, I would say probably the largest change, Bryan, was really a function of where we started, where we ended up in terms of average client base in the quarter. So, if you think about businesses like ours that are more established, you\u2019ve got a number of different factors that are weighing on the revenue, what\u2019s your rate of retention. We said that that was high, actually probably higher than we anticipated or planned. So, that was a positive. You had sales while sales revenue was better than we planned it still wasn\u2019t quite what it was overall pre-COVID. So, that had some better impact. But that wasn\u2019t a big driver. The bigger drivers, what was happening within the client base in terms of the number of clients, so we break that down. It\u2019s not just number of clients, but the employees those clients had. So the employees that the clients that were roughly about what we expected, we just had more clients in the base than we had on average than we had anticipated who were processing. So, remember, we\u2019re putting plans back together in May, June. We\u2019re trying to anticipate in an environment where states like California and New York, which are important revenue states, were largely starting to, or were in the process of being \u2013 continuing to be shut down. It turns out that those factors have moderated. So, what we are seeing when you look at a panorama across the country is moderate improving statistics in most geographies where we\u2019re looking at in across most industries, as Marty mentioned earlier, when you put that together, we start \u2013 if you will, from a little bit higher \u2013 a higher step on the rung or the ladder than we anticipated when the plan was put together. And another way to think about it, if you flip that analogy over or you change the analogy, it was definitely less worse than we anticipated as we started the year. We \u2013 the impact of COVID, which was very severe in April, had us all thinking what does this end up looking like. Well, those pundits who thought that the recovery would be sharp were actually more in the right than wrong. And now the recovery from here, we signaled that it\u2019s gradual. We\u2019re still seeing signs of a gradual recovery. Nothing is changing our mind at this point to say that we don\u2019t continue to progress from where we are, however, at a point where the trough wasn\u2019t quite as severe as we thought in the first quarter. Bryan Bergin : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I wanted to ask a question on the sales force. So, can you just give us a sense of the mix of the sales force that has returned here too in-person meetings, really I guess currently versus in 1Q really feet on the street model versus the virtual sales force and then how should we think about this mix longer term as things normalize? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think we are \u2013 we have picked up more virtual this year. So, it\u2019s still probably of the total. It might be 25% to 30%. I think that will continue to grow, particularly I think this is, as I mentioned earlier in the call, Bryan, I think that is accelerated. I think more client prospects, client prospects are able to do things over a Zoom call or over a Webex call, feel comfortable going through the demo digitally over and online and be able to make their decision. So, I think that\u2019s going to accelerate. I think it also is \u2013 it\u2019s more productive and efficient if they can be virtual. However, we are opening up, kind of as we speak, across the country with being able to go visit as well. We are doing it based on kind of state-by-state or city-by-city and whether the local management feels that the rules are there that they can visit, that the client is \u2013 the prospect is comfortable and the rep is comfortable. But that\u2019s starting to open up much more now. But I think you will see more virtual, more growth in virtual sales, meaning telephonic. We\u2019ve been in it for many years, and you also have more self-service as well \u2013 as both Efrain and I have mentioned \u2013 that on the low end, the smaller sized clients, much more is being done without ever talking to a rep at all because of the investments we\u2019ve made at both Sure and SurePayroll\u2019s products and Flex\u2019s product that you can go online and basically search, find it, demo it and buy it pretty much without talking to anybody, but you can always reach someone if you needed. So, virtual is going to be more of a way of the future, but we\u2019re still always going to have furthermore complex sales, the experienced reps that are there in person and with the sales engineering team demoing the product and so forth. Efrain Rivera : Yes. And I just want to reiterate what Marty said. While in the past you would have thought about \u2013 okay, sales equates to how many sales people you have and where are they. That\u2019s only one factor in the equation. If you have end-to-end e-commerce, the ability to sell without any salespeople, which was a something we invested in the last couple of years, then you\u2019re not constrained by the amount of people that you have in the field and we have seen the benefit of that in this quarter. Bryan Bergin : Just a follow-up there, what\u2019s the top end of employer size that you are seeing do it by themselves to that e-commerce model? Martin Mucci : I think, well, it depends on the \u2013 it\u2019s not always employer size. It could be employee size. It could be complexity. If you are pretty straightforward, it could be up into the 20 employees, but typically, I\u2019d say it\u2019s under 10 Bryan. But if it\u2019s a straightforward business it could be more employees than that, but it\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s typically under 10 employees. Bryan Bergin : Thanks, guys. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Hey, good morning, Marty and Efrain. Efrain, I wanted to ask a little bit about the guidance, and I\u2019m wondering if you have factored in any price increases into it. I know last year or last fiscal year you decided against it because of the situation we\u2019re in. I\u2019m just wondering for fiscal \u201821 what you anticipate? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So, the short answer is yes, there are price increases selective, I would say, that we are implementing. One of the reasons why we feel comfortable doing that is in part customer feedback, in part the fact that our operations people did such a stellar job that our NPS scores are again \u2013 I mean, we could keep going on and on about things that are record highs. But our NPS scores at this point through the pandemic are at record high, and that\u2019s the strength of our model. The strength of our model really plays well for this environment. And so, we think that there is opportunity for selective price increases. We obviously delayed through the first part of the year because we didn\u2019t think it was appropriate and we knew there were clients that were just hanging on and just struggling to get through the environment that we\u2019re facing. We think that many, many of our clients have stabilized, as evidenced by the increase in or the decrease in non-processing clients. And the level of service, we\u2019ve gotten great feedback on. And we think that many of our clients will be okay with modest price increase. So, we will do that as we go through the year. Kartik Mehta : And then just a second question on health insurance premiums, your expectations going into next year and what do you think that will \u2013 how that will impact the PEO business, if at all? Martin Mucci : I think Kartik, as I mentioned I think it\u2019s going to be pretty favorable. Generally, I think a high single-digit kind of increases depending on the client, of course, but generally I think if you looked crossed. And I think that\u2019s going to be very favorable for gaining new insurance clients. I think we performed very well. Our risk and underwriting team has done very well and therefore, I think, we\u2019re going to benefit from better rates, better rate changes. And I think also the overall environment is certainly helping us as well. So, I think that should bode well for better sales, even better sales from an insurance perspective for both PEO and the agency, the insurance agency itself. Kartik Mehta : Hey, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Martin Mucci : Okay, Kartik. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen of Citi. Pete Christiansen : Good morning. Thank you for the question and nice trends. I had two quick questions. So, I was wondering if you could characterize your win rates that you are seeing lately in terms of where are you winning these new accounts? Are you seeing it from self-processors or other competitors? Any discernible trends there would be helpful to understand and whether or not you believe you are seeing early signs of some share shift? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think \u2013 well, it\u2019s a little bit of both. We have mentioned, I think we are seeing those who have been self-processing, doing things themselves, and the complexity of the changes and the need for help at a critical time kind of in their business survival or growth, they have looked to outsource for the first time. So, I think, as I said, I think the pie has gotten larger. I think more are outsourcing. And that\u2019s been pretty steady over the years. And now that\u2019s \u2013 it feels like that changed and we are very happy that we have won, we think, a large number of those because of the product set and \u2013 not to mention as Efrain has mentioned many times \u2013 our lead generation and digital, the offering in the demo, etcetera., and the mobility app. And then I think also we have seen a net gain from some competitors this quarter, based something we track on our largest competitor. we see some gain there. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s huge, but I would say definitely a net positive gain from what we have sold from a competitor or taking in from a competitor versus lost, we saw a net gain. So, we are definitely gaining some market share there, at least as well as probably some of the smaller regional payroll providers in particular that just can\u2019t keep up with the need to support them from a payroll \u2013 a paycheck protection loan program, be able to give them the information they need for the loans that I said we had available to them pre-populated and then the Loan Estimator and for the forgiveness. I mean, we have a signature-ready application. All you have to do is go in and fill in rent, utilities or anything else that\u2019s non-payroll, the payroll data is already pre-populated. You can either sign electronically or print and just file that to get your loan forgiven. When you see those kind of technology advancements that we offer as opposed to particularly a regional company and even some of the national ones, it\u2019s a very different value proposition. So, in a time of extra need, I think you are seeing a shift toward more outsourcing. Pete Christiansen : That\u2019s helpful. And then I just had a quick one on, at least there\u2019s been some data that\u2019s coming out at least at the enterprise level, suggesting that companies that haven\u2019t been impacted directly by the pandemic are just now beginning to shed some jobs. And I was wondering if you are seeing any trends or any particular areas within the small business community that indicates that that trend is possibly creeping into small business? Martin Mucci : I would \u2013 I think small business took the biggest hit in Q4 \u2013 in what was our Q4, I mean that kind of March-April timeframe. And they have now \u2013 I think they are hurting and they need another stimulus. We are not counting on it based on what we have seen, but they certainly could use it. I think the most recent survey was over 80% of small businesses in particular who took the loans have used them up now and they are looking for a second stimulus to kind of help them through. And then we are not sure what the impact is going to be particularly in the Northeast as restaurants have to bring more diners inside and then have capacity constraints. So, I \u2013 there still could be some fallout. But I think small to mid-size business is probably hopefully took their biggest hit already and we are not necessarily seeing more layoffs there. They were also much more careful about bringing them back. We haven\u2019t seen a total return of the employees that have come back and they are probably down double-digits right now from where they were pre-COVID. Small businesses meaning, I haven\u2019t \u2013 I have started to bring people that I furloughed or laid off back, but I haven\u2019t brought everybody back yet. And so, I think we already saw that. I don\u2019t think we are seeing necessarily another drop off, unless there is no stimulus and people just say, hey, I can\u2019t survive anymore. But most of our data has shown a pretty good come back, progressively continuing to improve. Pete Christiansen : That\u2019s really helpful commentary, Marty. Thank you so much, gentlemen. Nice trends. Martin Mucci : Alright. You are welcome. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson. Lisa Ellis : Hi. Good morning, guys. First question is related to the PEO. I just want to understand a bit better what\u2019s going on in the PEO. I think, Efrain, you mentioned you first saw a sharp downturn and then now a sharp upturn. Can you just elaborate were you referring to sales or performance of the existing business or both of those? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Sorry about that, Lisa. Actually, it\u2019s probably both. But when I was making that comment really was a sharp decline in the number of worksite employees. So, even before we saw checks \u2013 check volume in checks and employees decline in the HCM business, we were seeing that in the PEO business where they shed employees more quickly. And then PEO had a more sharp upturn as conditions started to get better. Now, part of that could be what that \u2013 for example, states like Florida felt the impact in hospitality, accommodations, leisure. So, they were feeling it at first and then they started to come back and started hiring back, but \u2013 but that\u2019s what I was referring to, and obviously it also impacted sales and now we are talking back in the March-April timeframe. Lisa Ellis : Yes, okay. And so, on the sales side, are you finding \u2013 like, how are sales doing in the PEO? Are you finding that \u2013 I mean I know that\u2019s typically a reasonably complex sale, but I would imagine there is a lot of demand for it in the current environment. Are you finding that you are able \u2013 that the sales are rebounding and you are able to sell the PEO in the \u2013 even if it\u2019s remote in the current environment? Martin Mucci : Yes, Lisa. They have recovered even stronger, our ASO business. Our reps sell both PEO and ASO, meaning not the co-employment. And \u2013 but the need for HR kind of across the board has really taken off. So, they are \u2013 we are really strong on the ASO side and coming back on the PEO side as well. I think what Efrain said the strongest strength in the PEO has been the recovery of the worksite employees coming back on the payroll. On the sales side, PEO has done fine but the ASO has been even stronger. Now, our reps can sell both. So, I think whatever the need of the client has and if it\u2019s not as much of an insurance need or they are not as interested in insurance right now, but the needs airs toward HR, which I think we have seen, then that may lead to an ASO sale, which sometimes is a little bit quicker because you don\u2019t have to go through the underwriting and so forth. So, I think PEO has come back, but ASO has been much stronger. And overall, it\u2019s been because it\u2019s driven by an HR need, a human resource administration and need to handle all of \u2013 whether it\u2019s furloughs, layoffs, COVID, leaves of absence for family etcetera., that\u2019s where the biggest demand has been is how do I handle all of this stuff, and we have really seen that. And of course, we have those strong HRG\u2019s, the HR generalist, 600 of them across the country. We have been able to sell the value of that HR person that\u2019s helping those clients quite dramatically here in the last quarter. Lisa Ellis : Okay. And then I will \u2013 for my last one, I will ask the inevitable election question, because by the time we talk to you guys next quarter it will be over. So, what policies or agenda items are you keeping the most close eye on, as we get closer to the election? Martin Mucci : Well, it\u2019s interesting because I think one generally has obviously been better \u2013 it appears better for business when you look at the last few years, because of the growth in businesses and so forth. And the other side could probably bring a lot more regulations and more opportunities with depending on the healthcare and so forth that comes out in the regulation. So, if it\u2019s heavier regulations, there\u2019s going to be a lot of opportunity there. If the administration changes that would give us great opportunity. If the administration stays in place with try to be less regulations but I would say more confusing regulation that gives us an opportunity as well. So, we really see kind of not trying to play the middle of the line here, but we do see opportunities on both sides, whatever happens with the election. Probably, it tends to be a little bit more on the regulation side if a Democrat gets in there but \u2013 and it will just be change which will make some businesses outsource more because they are worried about the changes. But either way, I think we see opportunities coming from it. We are watching the level of insurance and healthcare regulations, any impacts on 401(k) in retirement and what that impact there. And then on payroll and HR, it really is just the level of regulations and so forth. Either way, I think there is going to be plenty for us to do and plenty of opportunity to be frank with you. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thanks, guys. Good stuff. Martin Mucci : Okay. Thanks, Lisa. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much. I know it\u2019s late. I will just keep it to one. You talked about accelerating some of the cost initiatives. Can you tell us of the $31 million booked, how is that separated between OpEx spends and SG&A and what kind of cost savings should we expect on both those line items from these initiatives? Thanks. Efrain Rivera : Hey, Jeff, rather than get into, I am laughing, because I talked to the controller and most of it\u2019s going to end up in G&A, but we will just footnote it in the slide, so you can update your models. Jeff Silber : Okay, great. And in terms of the cost savings, have you quantified what you expect? Efrain Rivera : I think I provided some guidance last quarter. I would have to go back and update that. I think it will be comparable to the cost that we take out, but let me revisit that to get a better answer. Jeff Silber : Okay, appreciate it. Thanks so much. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana of Jefferies. Samad Samana : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Similarly, I will keep it to one. Just Efrain, did you mention this quarter how many customers are still Paychex customers, but that aren\u2019t processing payrolls actively. I think you gave that mix last quarter. Just maybe an update on that and how that changed quarter-over-quarter would be helpful? Martin Mucci : Yes. Efrain Rivera : Go ahead. Martin Mucci : Sorry. Efrain Rivera : No, go ahead, Marty. Martin Mucci : Samad, as I mentioned earlier, we didn\u2019t give the absolute number, but we are down about three quarters from the peak. And even that number was, I think people misunderstood that it was very large even at its peak and \u2013 but we are down to like we are down three quarters from where it peaked. We still could take some losses from those clients, but it\u2019s not a big number compared to our client base and we are watching those clients. Some of those again maybe hanging on for year end or to see if they get another stimulus to kind of help them through, but the number \u2013 and the number dropped three quarters and very few of them went lost. So, we really feel very good about the ones that came \u2013 that reduced the number that were non-processing. Most of them are back processing now. They are processing with the fewer employees, then \u2013 because they haven\u2019t brought them all back, but they are processing and less than \u2013 definitely less than 10% of the number went lost. So, it was really a very positive so far and we have got kind of that last quarter that were suspended kind of hanging on either for more stimulus or year end and we will have a good sense of that, I think at the end of the next quarter, I can tell you kind of exactly. My guess is that will be pretty much off the service by then or there will be very few left, but it\u2019s not a number now that\u2019s really impacting us that much at all. Samad Samana : Great. I appreciate the clarity and hope you and your families are all doing well. Thanks again. Efrain Rivera : Thank you, Samad. You too. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Tien- tsin Huang : Thank you so much. Also encouraging results. I just wanted to hone in on the winning the startups piece. I thought that was really interesting. How much of your success there with startups do you think is organic versus doing something different in digital marketing and driving internet leads? I know, Efrain, you and I have talked about this, I am curious if there is a different muscle you are using to generate that? Martin Mucci : Well, I think it is. I think as Efrain mentioned, he has used the word digital probably, I think he has won the prize for using it. Those investments, Tien-tsin, have really made a big difference. As Efrain pointed out, you start back a number of years ago and whether it\u2019s SurePayroll or Flex, both we have invested a lot in making that easy to search to then demo online as well as be able to buy online and that has really paid off, as Efrain mentioned, in this environment, while people are remote and they are going to get \u2013 they are getting more used to not talking to anyone. I think that was the trend anyway. All of us would say that right that people not wanting to necessarily meet with someone just especially if they are small in fairly simple business to be able to go online and figure it out themselves and set themselves up. Not to mention that one of the biggest challenges of having more leads was then getting a hold of the prospect after you got the lead. This ability allows people to start and then actually encourages them to start the process of self \u2013 of sign-up and setting themselves up and then sales rep can jump in at any time and realizes if that has slowed down to help them through the process. But now they have already started to setup. Before when you had to reach someone and contact them, a lot of times we weren\u2019t able to contact the prospect or they had already gone somewhere else. This, in these investments that we have done from a digital standpoint in both the lead generation and the self setup, have helped a lot and at a time when a lot more startups are looking for someone, that has been kind of the perfect marriage of timing there. Tien- tsin Huang : Yes, thank you for that, Marty. That\u2019s very complete answer. Just the follow-up and I will let you guys go. Just on the \u2013 there is a lot of talk about outsourcing and going through the selling season. Can you remind us, because I get this question a lot, I just want to make sure I am fresh on it, just what percent of the SMB market is in-house, as you define it versus outsourcing today? Martin Mucci : Well, the number has always pretty consistently been 30%, 30% to 35% outsource and 65% to 70% still do it themselves of the small business market and that has not changed for many years. Now, I haven\u2019t got the most up-to-date data, but I would definitely feel that has adjusted given the pandemic and then I think that\u2019s a trend that\u2019s going to continue as people have \u2013 once they have seen the value of it, that\u2019s what\u2019s changed. So, it\u2019s always been kind of a 30%, 70% meaning outsource and not outsource, and I definitely think that shifted. It probably had a pretty good shift here in the last two quarters. Tien- tsin Huang : Makes sense. Thanks for your time. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of Baird. Mark Marcon : Hey, good morning, Marty and Efrain. Wondering with regards to the in-house clients that you are picking up, what are they using typically? Are they using Intuit and QuickBooks or are they using Excel spreadsheets, just what\u2019s the level of sophistication and what are you seeing in terms of the average client that\u2019s switching over? Martin Mucci : Mark, it\u2019s going to be more anecdotal. We don\u2019t track it really close, because the client doesn\u2019t always say it, but I think it\u2019s a mix of those. I would say, it\u2019s probably more do it kind of themselves manually than it is Intuit, but I think Intuit could be \u2013 that could be 25% or 30% of the mix coming in. But a lot of times they haven\u2019t used anything. It\u2019s more just figuring it out themselves on an Excel spreadsheet type of thing and that kind of thing. And then the need for payroll kind of combined with HR has pushed them kind of over the limit to say, hey, I need something else. I just don\u2019t need a calculator of payroll. I need to understand the rules and regs and I have got somebody that\u2019s now taking a family leave because of COVID or they need to stay home with children or something, how do I handle all this? What about parental leave? How do I handle all these rules? And it\u2019s by multi-state in particular it\u2019s really hard to keep up with it. So, I think it\u2019s been that combination of not just \u2013 I don\u2019t just need a calculator, I need really helping how to do these things and that my employees are asking for more from a mobile standpoint. So \u2013 and my employees are expecting to be \u2013 they are now asking for Pay-on-Demand, for example. We haven\u2019t even touched on that in this call. We offer Pay-on-Demand. They have started asking that I worked 8 hours, because more employees are working shifts and part-time and various shits where instead of being more normalized, they are asking for Pay-on-Demand. They are asking for access to their checks stubs on a mobile. We are now offering Google search. So, if I say \u2013 Hey, Google, what \u2013 I want to be able to ask Siri or Google what I got paid and when I got paid. That\u2019s now available. These are things that more younger, I guess I would say employees are asking for that flexibility and those demand, and they can\u2019t do that with what they have been using. Mark Marcon : Since you brought it up, on the Pay-on-Demand, what percentage of the clients are now using that? Martin Mucci : You know, it\u2019s still pretty small, but it\u2019s growing. I think more clients are seeing the ability to have it. I don\u2019t \u2013 I think the clients feel like, especially with our \u2013 the way we\u2019re offering it today, it\u2019s no risk to the clients themselves. It\u2019s being done that way. I think more employees that are realizing that it\u2019s available are asking for it and more clients being aware of how simple it is to do it, it will pick up. It\u2019s still very small from a starting standpoint, but it\u2019s starting to get attention, particularly again with this environment where hey, I just may need somebody to work 8 hours here. And that employees says, if I am only working 8 hours this week or because of children at home, I can only work 16 hours or 20 hours, I would like the money right now instead of waiting 2 weeks to get my check, because I am not working full-time right now. It\u2019s becoming more interest. So, we are trying to get the word out there that it\u2019s available. And I think it\u2019s starting to catch up, but it\u2019s still pretty small at this point. Mark Marcon : Appreciate that. And of the new clients that you are getting that warrants doing self-service, can you break it out just in terms of what percentage of the new clients you are getting were self-service versus your largest competitor versus regionals? Martin Mucci : I don\u2019t have that right in front of me. I don\u2019t know Efrain, if you. Efrain Rivera : No, I don\u2019t have that detail. Martin Mucci : I would have to \u2013 we would have to look and see if we have got that. But I would try \u2013 I don\u2019t have it right in front of me. It\u2019s a pretty good \u2013 as we are saying, I think the uptick from normal sales value that\u2019s driving a lot of growth is the more at the newer outsourcing that we have talked about that are outsourcing for the first time. And new business is definitely up, I would say, double digits as well. Efrain Rivera : Yes, Mark, part of the reason why you are not getting a crisp answer on that is we recognize we are in an unusual environment where new business formation is up. Martin Mucci : Yes. Efrain Rivera : And we think that there is a \u2013 in addition to everything else, we are benefiting from that and we seem to have the right solutions for the right time, at the right place in the market. Mark Marcon : And new units are up. What percentage were they up during this last quarter? Efrain Rivera : You were going to ask. So, the answer is good. we are not going to give you the exact number. So good means certainly more than low single-digits, Mark. Mark Marcon : More than low single digits, okay. And how about ACV? Efrain Rivera : I am sorry, how about what? Martin Mucci : Average client base. Mark Marcon : ACV. Efrain Rivera : The average client base, I am not sure I know what the acronym means or maybe I am missing? Mark Marcon : Annul contract value of the bookings that you are selling. In other words, book of sales\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Okay, okay. Yes, yes. No, no, no. We will update that as we go through the year, Mark. So, we are not going to provide that on a quarterly basis. Mark Marcon : Okay, great. Efrain Rivera : Okay. That\u2019s a good one. I will just put that in the acronym lexicon. Mark Marcon : Okay. And then finally, Marty, I heard your interview with regards to the discussion in terms of employment growth and the PPP. How are you thinking about this fall and winter with regards to \u2013 you said you are not expecting the stimulus that comes through. It sounded in your interview like you thought that was really crucial for some clients. Can you just discuss like how crucial do you think it is? What percentage of the clients are really kind of at the end here or \u2013 and how we should think about that, because all the comments are really positive. And it sound \u2013 but it also sounds like you\u2019re not expecting the stimulus to come through. So, I am just trying to put those two together? Martin Mucci : Yes. Efrain Rivera : Hey, Mark, I just want to clarify something. The comments are positive versus expectations. I mean, we\u2019re not sitting here saying that everything is great, etcetera. We understand the environment which we are operating. Our comments are positive, because the results suggest that it\u2019s better than we expected and we are navigating through the environment. So, I just want to make sure we are not painting a rosy macroeconomic picture that everything is great. We are saying we are navigating effectively through the environment. That\u2019s the idea that we want to convey. We understand the challenges. Martin Mucci : Yes. And that it\u2019s better than we expected. We expected less of a recovery in that first quarter and it\u2019s been much stronger and we performed very well compared to our expectations. But you are right, triangulating all my interviews, this is the problem with doing too many interviews. You are right, about 80% \u2013 what we have seen in general surveys, not just our clients, but in general. About 80% are saying they are at the end of the first loan. About 40% or 45% are saying they need additional stimulus. We think it\u2019s important that they get additional stimulus. What Efrain was saying that in our forecast, we have not built that into say that that\u2019s going to be a big impact. And we have not built in that they are going to get it, and that\u2019s going to have a big impact. So, as we look out, the hardest thing is forecasting the second half of the year, because \u2013 one, we did much better than we thought in the first quarter. We can kind of see what that\u2019s \u2013 what\u2019s happening into the second quarter. That\u2019s probably fairly predictable. What\u2019s really unpredictable is the second, the third and fourth quarters, fourth quarter in particular, where we estimated already that there was going to be a positive growth year-over-year. Now, it\u2019s a better compare obviously to a tough fourth quarter previous year, but it\u2019s hard to predict. So, I think the stimulus is \u2013 another stimulus for small and mid-sized businesses is absolutely needed. It needs to have more flexibility, it needs to have an easier way to forgive the loans. Is that going to happen? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just that I think Efrain was saying at the beginning, hey, we didn\u2019t build in like that was going to have a big impact in the second quarter. So, if it does happen, that should help us and give us even more tailwind. But we weren\u2019t including it at this point. Mark Marcon : I appreciate that. Great job in terms of all the things you can control. Martin Mucci : Okay. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Thanks Mark. Appreciate it. It means a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from\u2026 Martin Mucci : Operator, are there any other questions? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh, Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thanks. Just a follow-up. Alright, I will keep it tight. Efrain, I will keep it tight. Hey, just the record sales, and you have talked about this a couple of different ways, but is there a way to frame just what the average client size is or maybe just how much of those sales coming in are DIY as opposed to traditional method? And did that \u2013 did the mix help contribute to the margin boost in terms of the guidance or was that more just over performance on expense, just better expense management? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I would say, because of where it was coming and because of the channels through which came in, it tended to be smaller rather than larger. That\u2019s where you tend to see more of an impact on those kinds of sales. It doesn\u2019t contribute necessarily the change in margin profile going forward. But obviously, if we continue to see that kind of sustained performance, it\u2019s positive for the business. Kevin McVeigh : Awesome. I will leave it there just in the interest of time. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O\u2019Neill of Goldman Sachs. Matthew O\u2019Neill: Yes, hi, gentlemen. Can you hear me? I\u2019m sorry. Martin Mucci : Yes, go ahead, Matt. Matthew O\u2019Neill: Thanks so much for taking my question. I realize we are way beyond time here. I was just curious, so many things have been asked and answered and really impressive resiliency of the business throughout, obviously, unprecedented time here. Going back to the Paycheck Protection, is there any quantifiable dynamics that you guys have kind of internally studied with respect to the percentage of the current base that\u2019s been a recipient of that or when you think about those businesses that are may be at this point kind of struggling, is there any kind of quantifiable metrics around that? Martin Mucci : I don\u2019t \u2013 Matt, I don\u2019t have those numbers right in front of me. We do know that \u2013 well, we did a number of things. We partnered with three FinTech companies to help \u2013 including Vista Credit and some others to help get loans out there. We provided those reports, as I said, the first to provide the payroll report. We think our clients have about 28 billion in loans based on what we know out there. When you think about that across the whole base that\u2019s not a huge number, when you think about distressed businesses in the base, we felt good about the fact that we are able to help them get those loans and secure those loans and \u2013 but I think it\u2019s not a real large percentage that took the loan or needed it. But I am sorry I don\u2019t have that, I know we were trying to track it. It was tough to be able to track through that data to see how many of our clients actually took the loan. We do know that we worked through about $28 billion is what we expect of loans outstanding. So we will try to follow up on that. Matthew O\u2019Neill: Okay. Thanks so much, guys. I will leave it there. Martin Mucci : Okay. Thanks, Matt. Matthew O\u2019Neill: That sounds great. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Operator, I think we are going to \u2013 yes. Operator, I think, given the time, we will close the call at this point. Efrain Rivera : Are there \u2013 is there anyone else on the call? Martin Mucci : Operator? Operator : We do have a final question from the line of David Grossman of Stifel. Martin Mucci : Okay, we will take that. David Grossman : Thanks. Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to prolong this even longer than it already is going. I am sorry. Martin Mucci : For you, we will prolong. David Grossman : Thank you. I really just have a clarification and I really just wanted to follow-up the question earlier about growth in the second half of the year. Like Jason, actually I had the guidance at low single-digit growth for the previous call in the back half of the year and perhaps we all misunderstood what you had said previously. So perhaps, Efrain, you could just share with what your guide was for the back half, 3 months ago? Efrain Rivera : Yes, I think I just said that we expect the back half of the year to be flat to very low single-digits. So, to the extent you say, hey, Efrain, you are not saying anything different than you said. Let\u2019s just say I say it with a little bit more conviction this time. David Grossman : Alright, fair enough. Let\u2019s leave it there. Thanks again. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Thanks a lot. Martin Mucci : Okay, at this point, we will close the call. And if you are interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 30 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our first quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Hope everyone stays safe and thank you for calling in. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all lines have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Martin Mucci. Please go ahead, sir. Martin Mucci : Thank you, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex second quarter of fiscal 2021 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2020. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start today\u2019s call with an update on our business highlights for the second quarter. Efrain will review our second quarter financial results and provide an update on our outlook for fiscal 2021 and then we will open it up for your questions. While the first-half of fiscal 2021 was affected by the economic impacts of COVID-19, we have been pleased with the results of our business and the sequential improvement over the first quarter in both revenues and earnings. Improvements in revenue occurred across the board, all lines of business, most of our key business metrics have continued to show steady improvement, though at a more moderate pace as we ended the quarter. We have not yet experienced any deterioration related to recent surges in COVID-19 cases across the country, but we continue to monitor trends closely, especially as new restrictions are being implemented in many states. Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, our business model has proven resilient, our client base has grown despite economic headwinds and we continue to see good sales momentum with growth year-over-year in new units sold. Our digital sales remain an area of strength and we continue to invest in digital marketing, lead generation and sales technologies to drive growth. We also see strong demand for HR solutions and HR outsourcing, which we deliver through both our ASO and PEO models. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have seen a greater interest in ASO \u2013 in the ASO model as businesses are looking for more immediate HR support. We are on track for another year of record retention as losses have declined significantly compared to the prior year. Client satisfaction scores continue to improve as we focus on providing excellent service to our customers, supporting them in this most challenging time in helping them simplify complex regulations. We have not let up on our efforts to help our clients navigate this environment, and we continue to educate clients and prospects on state and local specific regulations, which are frequently changing, including the new stimulus initiatives passed by Congress. Our retention team is proactive in reaching out to clients who may be showing signs of difficulty to consult with them regarding available options. And our clients are facing the most complex calendar year-end many have ever seen and we are here to help them through it. We have expanded our thought leadership, not only in the area of COVID-related regulations, but more recently offering information on the 2020 election results and the potential impacts to our clients\u2019 businesses. We continue to see demand for virtual events and webinars to help educate clients and prospects in this changing environment. Our financial strength allows us to continue to make investments in technology. Our fall product for launch builds on our track record of innovation and delivers on our promise to make complex business issues simple. We introduced several new offerings and enhancements that help businesses increase productivity, reduce risk, maintain compliance and adapt to mobile and AI-driven trends. More business leaders are turning to tech solutions to increase productivity in this environment and respond to the interest of their employees. Our Apple Watch and Google Assistant device integration now allows employees to access their HR and payroll information easily without even logging on to their phone or PC. We also added new features in our performance management system to allow for greater feedback and engagement with remote employees critical to employee retention in development in this work-from-home environment. We continue to enhance our analytics suite in dashboards, we deliver a user experience that enables clients to define the data that is most relevant and actionable to them, which saves time, improves productivity and supports better business decisions. We also see positive trends with double-digit increases in mobile and self-service usage as our strategy of device independence continues to gain traction with customers. We recently announced the integration of Paychex Flex with the market-leading Clover point-of-sale platform from Fiserv. Available on the Clover app market, this gives business owners the ability to streamline payroll and time and attendance management. This is another example of our commitment to connect Paychex Flex users with some of the world\u2019s leading business tools. We are proud of these innovations and more were recognized by industry experts this quarter, most recently, the Paychex Flex platform was recognized by human resource executive magazine with an HR Tech Award for the Top HR Product of the Year. The combination of a single device-independent application with HR services and benchmarking capabilities sets us apart from others in this category. We continue to design solutions that add value to our clients. Our new PEO, Protection Plus Package, helps business owners reduce risk by offering coverage related to cyber attacks and employee lawsuits. Exposure to these risks has been rapidly increasing in the COVID-19 environment and we are the only provider offering both cyber liability and EPLI coverage as part of our PEO solution. And by leveraging the group plan model of our PEO, the coverage is significantly more affordable to businesses. The COVID-19 environment has also impacted the financial security of millions of Americans, further exacerbating the issue of lack of retirement savings in the U.S. This month, we announced that we are among the first in the retirement industry to sponsor and maintain a pooled employer plan to help businesses nationwide provide a cost-effective retirement plan option for their eligible employees. This offering is an outcome of the SECURE Act, and along with a reduced cost compared to a single employer plan, it will reduce fiduciary liability for employers and simplify plan management. As we move through this period of uncertainty, we are confident that our resilient business model, strong liquidity position and dedicated employees who are focused on service and innovation for our clients and their employees will have Paychex emerge from this pandemic in an even stronger position in the market with our clients having experience the full value and support that we deliver. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the second quarter. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thank you, Marty. Before I begin, let me just wish everyone on the phone call a safe and a joyous holiday season. I hope you get some time off to enjoy this Covidian season. We are making of it what all of us can make of it to make it a good time. So let\u2019s start. I want to remind you that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward-looking statements, refer to the customary disclosures. In addition, I\u2019ll periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the press release and investor presentation for more information on these measures. Let me start by providing some of the key points for the quarter, follow-up with some \u2013 excuse me, greater detail in certain areas, and then wrap with the review of the fiscal 2021 outlook. As Marty mentioned, while second quarter results continue to reflect the impact of economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 crisis, they improved sequentially from first quarter. For the second quarter, total service revenue of $969 million was even with the prior year. And this was moderated by a larger \u2013 a lower volume of client employees paid across our HCM solutions. Results improved from a decline of 6% in the first quarter, as you recall. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue started to increase, it was up 1% to $733 million and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue decreased 3% to $236 million. During our October earnings call, I\u2019ve noted that second quarter revenue was anticipated to be down mid to high single digits for Management Solutions and high single digits to low double digits for PEO and Insurance Solutions. Our results exceeded those expectations, obviously. Total revenue declined 1% to $984 million, that basically is the impact of further declines in interest on funds held for clients. Interest on funds held for clients were down 25% for the quarter to $15 million due to lower average interest rates, average investment balances and realized gains. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients declined 4% during the quarter, primarily due to lower client fund collections and changes in the client base mix. That was offset by timing of collections and remittances and some wage inflation. Expenses decreased 3% to $629 million. The decline in expenses was driven by lower headcount, discretionary spending and facilities costs as a result of our cost savings initiatives. Operating income, up 4% to $354 million and reflected an operating margin of 36%. I\u2019m sorry, a 150 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. As a reminder, other expense now for the second quarter includes interest on our long-term borrowings, partially offset by corporate investment income, which was impacted by lower interest rates. Our effective income tax was 22.1% for the second quarter, compared to 23.2% for the same period last year, both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to stock-based comp payments that occur with the exercise of stock option awards as you know, we call those out, simply because it\u2019s difficult to predict when they will occur. Net income increased 5% to $272 million and adjusted net income increased 4% to $265 million for the quarter. Adjusted net income excludes one-time costs in the tax benefit from stock-based comp payments. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 4% during the quarter to $0.75 and $0.73 per share, respectively. Year-to-date, I\u2019ll touch on these very quickly they are in the press release. Service revenue declined 3% to $1.9 billion with Management Solutions revenue declining 2%, PEO and Insurance Solutions declining mid single-digits, interest on funds held for clients declined 27% as we bore the brunt of lower interest rates, total revenue was down 3% to $1.9 billion, operating income decreased 8% to $638 million and adjusted operating income decreased 3% to $670 million, reflecting a margin of 35%. Adjusted operating margin, as you know, excludes one-time costs of $32 million related to acceleration of cost savings initiatives including the long-term strategy to reduce our geographic footprint and headcount optimization, majority of which was recognized in the first quarter. The amount recognized in second quarter was minimal, about $1 million or so from that amount that we had talked about when we initially released guidance. Diluted earnings per share decreased 8% to $1.34 I should say and adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 4% to $1.36. Investments and income. As you know, our primary goal is to protect principal and optimize liquidity, continue to invest in high credit quality securities. Long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.9%, average duration of 3.4 years. Our combined portfolios earned an average rate of return of 1.3% for the quarter, down from 2% last year. Let\u2019s talk about financial position. It remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $963 million and total borrowings of $804 million as of November 30, 2020. Funds held for clients were $3.4 billion, in line with the balance as of May 31, 2020. Funds held for clients wary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.6 billion for the second quarter. Our total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $109 million compared with $100 million as of May 31, 2020. The increase in net gain position resulted from the declines in interest rates. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $2.9 billion as of November 30, 2020, reflecting $447 million in dividends paid and $29 million of shares repurchased during the first six months. Return on equity for the past 12 months remained very strong at 38%. Cash flows from operations were $431 million for the first six months, a decrease from the same period last year. The decrease was driven by lower net income and fluctuations in working capital, including an increase in accounts receivable, which drove most of that, and that is parallel to our recovery in our revenue. Now, I will turn to our guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2021. It reflects our current thinking regarding the speed and timing of the economic recovery, while results for the first half of the fiscal year exceeded expectations. Uncertainty about the trajectory of the recovery over the remainder of the year remains particularly with the recent surge in COVID-19 cases. Improvements in key indicators have moderated and our guidance reflects a steady but gradual improvement through the rest of the fiscal year, although not at the pace of the first six months. We have provided the following updates to our guidance after seeing the second quarter results. Management Solutions revenue year-over-year is expected to be in the range of a decline of 1% to growth of 1%. We previously guided to a decline in the range of 1% to 3% with a bias toward the high end of that range. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to decline in the range of 2% to 5% that is unchanged from prior guidance. Interest on funds held for clients that is expected to be between $55 million and $65 million, that\u2019s also unchanged from prior guidance. Total revenue expected to be in the range of a decline of 3% to flat or even with last year, we previously guided to a decline in the range of 2% to 4%. Adjusted operating income as a percentage of total revenue is now anticipated to be approximately 36%, up from previous guidance of approximately 35%. And adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year fiscal 2021 is expected to be approximately 41%, up from approximately 40%. Other expense net is anticipated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million, previously it was a range of $30 million to $35 million. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%, while we previously guided to a range of between 24% and 25% and adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to decline in the range of 1% to 4%, we previously guided to a decline in the range of 6% to 8%. Turning to the second half of the fiscal year, we currently anticipate total revenue will be in the range of flat to up low-single digits. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 37% to 38%. Now, let me talk about the third quarter. Management Solutions revenue is expected to decline in the low-single digits and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue would decline in mid to high single-digits, impacted by lower rates for workers compensation and state unemployment insurance. Adjusted operating margins excluding one-time costs are anticipated to be approximately 41% in the third quarter. Of course, all of this is subject to our current assumptions which are subject to change. We\u2019ll update you again on the third quarter call. I will refer you back to our Investor shares on our website for more information. And now with all of that, I will turn it back to Marty. Martin Mucci : Great. Thanks, Efrain. Operator, we will now open the call to questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question this morning. Efrain Rivera : Hi, good morning. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could let us know whether your guidance assumptions include stimulus. And I guess also as a follow-on question to that, now that you\u2019ve lived through it once, what would a second round of stimulus \u2013 do you have any kind of a better understanding of how that would impact the P&L? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So let me handle the first-half and then the second-half. So the short answer, Ramsey, is that, no, it doesn\u2019t include the impacts of any stimulus, it\u2019s a little bit tough to gauge, but it would be a net positive. I\u2019ll let Marty talk to kind of what we think the benefit might be. Martin Mucci : Yes. I think a number of benefits, obviously, a lot of clients have been kind of holding \u2013 some clients have been holding on waiting for a second stimulus. What we have found is that, those who \u2013 when we surveyed our clients, those who took a PPP loan the first time, virtually 100% of them were still in business, so 99.8% or something. So obviously, the stimulus, the first one made a big difference for holding clients over and until things pick back up. And I think the second one will do the same thing and it\u2019s very targeted to small and \u2013 kind of on the smaller end of mid-sized businesses, which is even better and has better parameters from what we can see, at least that was signed or approved by Congress for forgiveness for loans as well. We also have done some things like made sure that we\u2019re totally connected now with fintech providers and lenders like Biz2Credit. So we can pass our information from payroll and they can \u2013 clients can approve the fact that they can move information directly to a fintech provider like Biz2Credit to get a loan. So I think everything is going to speed up faster from a stimulus perspective. If you need a loan, you\u2019re going to get it easier, faster. The forgiveness is going to be even better than before, particularly if you are on the low end. And not to mention that I think payroll and HR Solution services software is covered by the expenses or part of the expenses that can be covered. So I think it\u2019s going to be positive. Certainly, it\u2019s going to be positive to the degree how much, it\u2019s hard to tell at this point. Ramsey El-Assal: Great. And then I was wondering if you could also comment on or give us a little more color on the underlying drivers in management solutions for the rest of the year. It\u2019s great to see the outperformance this quarter. It looks like there is some moderation expected. Maybe a little more color on what you are seeing in your portfolio that\u2019s causing you to be a little bit conservative going forward here? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So let me talk about first kind of what have been the drivers in the first six months and then why third quarter looks a little bit different perhaps than \u2013 sequentially than other quarters. And by the way, I would just ask for other people in the queue, if there is a question that\u2019s really kind of related to what we are discussing, if you could just sort of keep your questions brief, because we want to try to get to everyone. So, the short answer to your question on Management Solutions is that, Management Solutions has HR outsourcing and the ASO model in that revenue stream. It\u2019s got retirement services in that stream. Other modules of Flex, including and very importantly, time and attendance in that revenue stream and then some other items. All of those products are doing very well. And I would highlight the fact that if you look at the year, this has been the year of demand for HR services. So, if you look at our worksite employees across all of our platforms that provide HR support, our worksite employees are up. So we\u2019ve seen a very strong demand driving the revenue growth or the revenue recovery. Now we are battling, as I mentioned in my comments, we are battling the fact that the number of employees paid is down, obviously because of current unemployment, but the underlying trends are very, very positive. So, why as we get into Q3 does that change? In Q3, there are a number of revenue streams that are built annually and depend on the number of employees on the payroll at that point in time. Because they are lower, we anticipate that they will be lower simply because of the number of worksite employees that are being paid. It has a moderating impact on the revenue in the third quarter. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving that result. Obviously, then as we come out of Q3, those revenue streams are no longer a factor in Q4 and we expect a rebound in Q4. So, that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the \u2013 what would appear to be conservatism in Q3. We like where the underlying trends are in all of the revenue streams on Management Solutions and we see those continuing through the year into Q4. Ramsey El-Assal: That was super helpful and happy holidays to you both. Efrain Rivera : Thanks. You too. Operator : Your next question is from Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks so much. Happy holidays to you all. Hey, Efrain. Hey, Marty. Hey, congratulations on the retention, just really, really fantastic outcome. I wonder, Marty or Efrain, it just \u2013 it feels like based on the transition to the cloud that part of that is clearly structural, is there a way to think about whether how much you can narrow it from a retention perspective and then ultimately kind of translate that into revenue relative to the cloud-based providers? Because it seems like as you\u2019ve transitioned the business model to the cloud, it should clearly call for even higher levels of retention. So, maybe help us understand that a little bit? Martin Mucci : Well, I think ultimately, the retention is about \u2013 as you know, about the level of service and value that you are bringing these clients. And I think the work that we\u2019ve done on innovation and technology investment to the cloud has made a lot of benefits. And I think they\u2019ve really shown up in this pandemic environment. If one of the positives, there can be a positive in this environment for businesses was that they could see the full value of Paychex and the service that we bring. So being on the cloud and the fact that many of them have \u2013 people working from home, they could see the technology and what being in the cloud meant to them. So, they could handle \u2013 they could improve productivity, they could have better retention of their employees, they could still develop them, train them, onboard them, they can do \u2013 they can handle all kinds of time and attendance measures. They can do anything that I don\u2019t think they even really thought a lot about beforehand and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever going to go back for them the way it was prior to that. So they understood the investments that we had made in the technology and innovation that we have. They found much more of a value from that and the cloud is certainly a big part of that, that they don\u2019t have to rely and there is a lot more self-service that they took advantage of and their employees took advantage of that saved them time and money and saved us time and money as well and focuses on high-value parts of the products. Efrain Rivera : The other thing I would add to that, Kevin, so your question is, okay, can we expect 25% or 50 basis points, 75 basis points better retention. I don\u2019t have a direct answer for that right now, but I will say this. It\u2019s very easy to envision that we have one service model that applies across the breadth of our 700,000 plus clients. The reality is that that\u2019s not correct. We have a variety of different service models that respond to the needs of the client as we understand. And I think that we have very high degree of customer intimacy with our clients and understand what kind of service model they need. And so we have a variety of different models that are designed to ensure that the client has the highest possible net promoter score we can have. Our net promoter scores in this year are at all-time record highs and it\u2019s in part because we have understood and have the capability, which others do not of being able to provide hybrid, flexible service models based on what the customer desires. And so I think as we continue to refine that, as we continue to get better and better at understanding what each customer and each segment needs, whether it\u2019s no service to full service, I think you are going to see our retention continue to improve. Kevin McVeigh : Super helpful. I want to be respectful of time, but \u2013 so I will go back into queue. I have another question, but I don\u2019t want to really get [indiscernible]. Thank you all. Efrain Rivera : Okay, thanks. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. Happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Same to you. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks. Thanks. I wanted to just get your view as you head into the key selling season here. Do you think COVID is going to have an impact on competitive dynamics in the sense that perhaps fewer SMBs look to switch providers, because they are consumed, we are just trying to keep their businesses afloat or is it actually possible that we see the opposite scenario with an above average amount of competitive switching as small businesses look to watch every dollar even more closely during the pandemic or perhaps their needs have become even more complex as a result of COVID? Martin Mucci : Yes. Jason, what we have seen and I would assume it\u2019s going to carry through into January this quarter selling season is there much more of a hesitancy to switch. So our retention is certainly benefiting from that. It does make sales away from competitors, a little more challenging to the degree, because they \u2013 I think your first assumption is what we have seen is more correct, which is just that people are not focused on switching. They don\u2019t want to go through the switch right now. And they have also at least in our \u2013 from our perspective, they have really, as I mentioned earlier, seen the value of what we can bring at an all-time high. So they are going to be reluctant to switch, because they are not focused on that. And also I think they have also seen we have gotten this feedback directly from clients with the way we help them, with the PPP loans, the first group, the way we help them with the forgiveness, the feedback they got from their accountants on how easy it was to file and get forgiveness or apply for the forgiveness of loans was really a step ahead of other competitors for us. We were able to pre-populate all their reports, the forgiveness application was pre-populated and signature ready with adding just a few bits and now that\u2019s even easier that we are going to tie them into the fintech lenders as well. So I think it\u2019s one a reluctance to move, but I also think they are seeing a lot more value and that\u2019s made a big difference in our retention. And then for sales, I also think that\u2019s going to help us. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. The revenue upside this quarter was more pronounced in HR management and wanted to get a better understanding of which specific products were especially outperformers in the second quarter? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think we may have mentioned that the ASO product really was strong. Any HR product, the need for HR, particularly when you think of so many employees working from home, some being furloughed whether they \u2013 how do you handle the credits, the tax credits and so forth about employee retention. All of those things helped really push HR support and more on the ASO side than the PEO side. I think insurance was not as important to them right now from a benefits perspective as the HR support wasn\u2019t, so more tended to say, look, I am not ready to switch or begin insurance, but I need the HR support pretty dramatically. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Well, thanks for the answers. Have a great holiday. Martin Mucci : Alright. Thanks. You too. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Josh Schimmer : Hi, good morning, everyone. This is Josh Schimmer on behalf of David Togut. Just wanted to ask my first question on business formation, so you mentioned last quarter that new businesses start up \u2013 new business startups were up 20% year-over-year, how did you see those trends continue into 3Q and can you give any projection for what you are expecting for the rest of the year? Martin Mucci : Well, I think yes, nationally, we have seen it continue, it\u2019s even higher than that. I think it\u2019s approaching high 30s or 40% increase in new business start-ups. I think what you are finding is both people shifting in the pandemic to new business opportunities and those starting new businesses. Some have been laid off from other businesses and have decided this is the time. Also money is fairly easy to get a hold of at low cost. They have home equity where they can take loans as well at low cost to start their businesses, so that has continued. We have seen the household sales that I mentioned in the first quarter, lot of nannies, tutors things like that where people had their kids at home and were buying for that. We have seen a lot of other new upstart businesses get started or change what they were doing and create a new business. So, it has continued. It\u2019s continued to accelerate higher than in the first quarter. And I would assume that may moderate to some degree because \u2013 but we will have to see. Josh Schimmer : Great. Thank you for the color. Next on capital allocation, can you provide or update your priorities and kind of what you are thinking in terms of capital allocation as we move beyond the COVID-19 environment? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I think we haven\u2019t really changed significantly. I mean obviously, payment of the dividend is an important part of the equation. We buyback shares to maintain share count level, but we are interested in looking at M&A and remain in the discussion for opportunities that we think could be interesting. Obviously, prices are high, but we think there is selected pockets of opportunity, where it may make sense. So, that\u2019s where we are at. Josh Schimmer : Great. Thank you all very much and have happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Thanks. Same to you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Steven Wald of Morgan Stanley. Steven Wald : Hey, good morning and happy holidays. Martin Mucci : You have the same. Thanks. Steven Wald : Maybe just starting off on what you guys are talking about with sort of the incremental penetration, the bundles, you called out the ASO strength. It just seems like you are getting better economics relative to each client and maybe that\u2019s part of additional market penetration and all the things you and other platforms have talked about in terms of incremental HCM demand. Just curious how big of a runway you see for that seeing it\u2019s already starting to show up as well as how you think of that in terms of lowering your macro sensitivity going forward? Martin Mucci : Well, I think there is a lot of opportunities still there. When you think about time and just take products like time and attendance, time and attendance has really been growing very strong double-digits for some time. We are seeing that with the innovation that we have put out there from the iris scan time clocks to the kiosks to punch in and punching out on your watch. All these things have driven even more demand for things like time and attendance. HR certainly has been driven a lot by the COVID environment, how different \u2013 I mean, you can understand that clients are facing for the first time challenges they have never seen before and they are going to continue, I think as the next big question will be, do you require vaccinations, for example, to bring people back to work? How do you verify that? What are the rules around that? What do you do with absences due to COVID or family or things like that? So, these are all so complicated for small to midsized businesses, who typically don\u2019t have an HR person. I think there is a great opportunity for continued demand for the services from light HR right to full ASO and PEO as well and that includes insurance, which we think will pickup in the back half of the year? Efrain Rivera : Hey, Steven. To the second part of your question, it\u2019s a good one. And I think frankly, if you really disaggregate our results and we look at kind of the second level of why the performance has been what it\u2019s been I think it\u2019s two things. The first thing is, our sales unit or our volumes on HCM have been up the first 6 months. We hope it continues into the back half of the year, but frankly, it\u2019s been higher than we expected. That strength of digital \u2013 strength of digital sales, marketing and a lot of the efforts that we put into the platform over the last several years, that\u2019s part one. But I think you highlight the second part, which is important, which is when you look at that \u2013 at the next level, what you realize or what you see is that, we have really had strength in terms of selling other products to the base. And I would say you are seeing in important respects the criticality of having an HR solution in the bundle of offerings that you give to clients. And by the way, I don\u2019t mean a HR solution in the sense of an HR administration module almost everyone has that, but the real ability to be able to provide counseling and consulting to clients in a very complex environment. And so we have benefited from the fact that we not only have been able to increase unit sales, but also increase penetration of services within the base. So part of that to your point has lessened the impact of what is obviously not a great macro-environment still, we hope it \u2013 in the back half of the year, it starts to get a bit better and it has moderated, but I think our ability to sell within the base, the importance of HR services across the continuum of what we sell has proven out thus far this year. Martin Mucci : And one other thing, I think it bodes well for retention. Sometimes when they took the HR product, they needed to set up their handbook for the first time they needed a couple of things that they never had, employee rules and kind of benefits and so forth. But now, when you think about it, there is such a continuation of this need, it\u2019s going to go on for some time, but I think that does bode well for retention of the HR products as well. Steven Wald : Okay, great. Appreciate the robust commentary from both of you there. Just maybe one follow-up to, I think something that Ramsey had asked about, the sort of baking in a stimulus and other factors. If we tape six or nine months, I think the way you described how you think of the upswing is sort of a gradual recovery. And I know you had characterized it as, the next six months are not going to be quite as robust as the last six months, but if I think about the sensitivity to the upside and downside if stimulus added in, as you see it is a slight net benefit. Is it also fair to think about the potential for a step back in employment or other macro factors has also not baked in, so this could be possible drag to offset that? How should we think about the push and pull there? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So that\u2019s interesting complex question, but I will try to give a simple answer. I mean, it could end up having that effect. My sense is that you didn\u2019t factor in completely what the impact of a vaccine has in all of that and that\u2019s really kind of the joker in the deck to the extent that it becomes more widespread and now you see an uplift in employment that\u2019s going to be a positive. If we continue in the same \u2013 with the same environment, I think what we are assuming is gradual improvement unless things get much worse, I think we are in reasonable shape. If it goes backwards, we will have to see what happens. As I mentioned and Marty mentioned too, we have seen some moderation over the last month or so in the improvement in forward-looking trends. Will it go the other way? I don\u2019t know, too early to call on them, Steven. Steven Wald : Okay. I just wanted to see how you were thinking about it. So appreciate the thoughts there. Happy holidays. Efrain Rivera : Thanks. Martin Mucci : Thanks. You too. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Andrew Nicholas of William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. First, I was hoping you could provide maybe a bit more detail on the health of the PEO business specifically. Anything you can say about kind of the growth rate in that business over the past couple of quarters? And then also just how conducive is the market right now for starting a brand new PEO relationship, just wondering if people are kind of stuck in their ways given the current environment or if there are still opportunities to initiate a new relationship there? Thanks. Efrain Rivera : Marty will take the second. I will come back to trends in the PEO. Martin Mucci : So, I think the second one is, I think as I mentioned, there has been some \u2013 there has been a much more of a demand for the HR support and sometimes that\u2019s with the PEO, but it\u2019s been a little bit more heavy in the ASO side for us and of course, we offer both. I think people have been a little more reluctant to change insurance providers and so forth. However, I do think that\u2019s going to start to change, because I think that\u2019s been a real benefit. And we also, as I mentioned, has provided a new bundle that\u2019s providing EPLI, so employment practices, liability protection, that\u2019s going to be very important right now, there\u2019s a lot of questions that are out there about how am I treating employees that are working from home, who have COVID, who are connected to someone who has, it may take time off. I think there is going to be \u2013 there is a lot of, as you know, of course, in the congressional discussion about liability protection for businesses, this is going to become a bigger issue as the overall health concern start to moderate. I think with the vaccine getting out, they\u2019re more widespread. So I think there is going to be an increased demand for the PEO. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be in the next quarter. They are steady demand and I think people are more open to it, everyday people understand the PEO business a little bit better, and they\u2019re looking for the same concept that the PEP has for retirement. It\u2019s a shared plan where we can share some of the liability protection, the fiduciary responsibility, the \u2013 and also get better rates and kind of better benefit packages by going with the PEO. So I think it maybe quiet for another \u2013 quieter for another quarter, but then start to pickup a little bit more as things calm down. Efrain Rivera : Yes. And with respect to your first question, Andrew, I think there is three factors driving the PEO results. The first is, in the first six months, if you look at our client base, we over-index a bit in terms of our exposure to hospitality and accommodations and so that as we entered this year, we were more exposed than we might have been in previous years. We had a pretty sharp rebound in first quarter that continued into the second quarter, but we were coming off a lower base. That\u2019s one. The second thing is, I called out in my comments, what we\u2019re seeing is much lower workers\u2019 comp and SUI rates. Those have an impact on revenue too. That\u2019s a trend that we\u2019re seeing. Certainly through the back half of the year, that\u2019s having an impact on revenues. And then, I would say, the final point is we\u2019ve seen lower at-risk insurance attachment in the PEO, part of that has been our decision on underwriting standards in this environment. So, we have been a bit tighter than we have. I think, in part, that\u2019s helped a bit of the ASO business, but it\u2019s hurt the PEO business a little bit. And also we prefer to be a little bit more conservative on underwriting as we get into the back half of the year and we see what the environment looks like. If you look at where the guidance was, we basically maintained, there is a lot of positives on the underlying performance, but there are some headwinds that we\u2019re battling on in other parts of the revenue streams in PEO. Andrew Nicholas : Great. Thank you. That\u2019s really helpful. And then, Marty, you mentioned the PEP plan that you introduced a few weeks back. It seems to me like Paychex is obviously really well positioned to be able to offer a plan of that type. But I\u2019m just wondering, bigger picture, to what extent new regulations on PEPs will impact Paychex? Does it increase the target market for retirement administration business? Does it open you up to additional competition? Just any additional color on that offering and what it means for Paychex would be great? Thank you. Martin Mucci : Yes, sure. I think the fact that we\u2019ve been in this for so long, well over 20 years, in the retirement business and that we provide more new retirement plans than anybody else in the business for at least the last 8 years, I think we\u2019re well positioned. I think that also proves the point that we were the first out \u2013 I think, pretty much that one of the first out with the PEP plan, we think it can be very competitive to opening up new market opportunities. Those small or mid-sized businesses that didn\u2019t want to get into a plan because they were worried about kind of administering the whole thing. We could be the record keeper, but they still have to take care of investments and would also have some other costs. This is going to lower their cost, allow it to be much more accessible to those who didn\u2019t quite step up to it. And I do think, as you said, I think Congress is going to push more and more of this \u2013 the new Congress and the new President administration, I think, will push for 401(k)s and probably give even more credits and benefits if you start one. So, I do think it opens up a market that we\u2019re already strong in, and it has great potential for us. Andrew Nicholas : Great. Thank you and happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Same to you. Operator : Your next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Good morning. Efrain, I just wanted to clarify something you said. The hit in 3Q revenues due to the number of employees on the payroll being lower, I guess why doesn\u2019t that have that same impact in 4Q \u201821? Is it \u2013 it sounds like it\u2019s more of just a one-time impact then in 3Q. Efrain Rivera : Yes, because there are certain revenue streams, Bryan, that are only build in the third quarter, and so \u2013 and they have \u2013 they obey or they follow the amount of employees you have on your books at that point, then it doesn\u2019t recur until the following third quarter. Bryan Keane : Got it. Efrain Rivera : [indiscernible] annual. It\u2019s just an annual bill. It\u2019s somewhat unusual, but happens every year. Bryan Keane : Got it. That makes sense. And then, when I think about how we modeled it out, at least we have a little bit lower now a third quarter, but a stronger fourth quarter. And just thinking about that fourth quarter, now it sounds to be a little bit stronger than what you kind of talked about last quarter. Just thinking about any pent-up demand in sales as we get to that easier comp in fourth quarter and how you\u2019re thinking about it? Efrain Rivera : Well, we hope it\u2019s going to be a good quarter because the compare certainly sets up to be a good quarter. I think it\u2019s comprehended, obviously, in the guidance. Obviously, Bryan, a lot \u2013 as you know, a lot of it depends on the momentum we come out of the third quarter with. So if we come out of the quarter with good momentum and the macro environment arrows are pointing upwards, I think a fourth quarter will be good. If the others don\u2019t pan out, then it will be slightly different. We\u2019ll update when we get through third quarter. Bryan Keane : Okay, great. Happy holidays, guys. Enjoy it. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. You too, Bryan. Operator : Your next question is from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Hey. Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Efrain Rivera : Good morning, Kartik. Kartik Mehta : Marty, I wanted to ask, I know you\u2019ve talked about the selling season and some hesitancy of people wanting to switch. Is that \u2013 what\u2019s the pricing environment like? Are you seeing more competition because people are trying to get market share or has the pricing environment not been that aggressive this year compared to maybe seasons past or even though the last few months? Martin Mucci : Kartik, I think it\u2019s been very consistent, which means it does get quite aggressive, particularly right now at this point, November, December. So I think you\u2019re seeing \u2013 we\u2019re seeing the typical same number of months free upfront or over the first year kind of thing. I wouldn\u2019t say anything more aggressive than we\u2019ve typically seen and I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s making as much of a difference. As I said, I think there is still a hesitancy to switch. We\u2019re definitely seeing that. I think it\u2019s helping, certainly, our retention and it is putting a little more pressure on sales. But right now, we\u2019re feeling pretty good going into selling season, we definitely have seen again a quarter of more unit growth than second quarter of last year, and that\u2019s pretty amazing to me when you think everyone is still home and they\u2019re selling from home. And we\u2019re strongly \u2013 we certainly have been selling inside for many years, but we also have a majority outside. And for their ability to adapt and be able to get to clients and then use the technology that we have that allows clients to search, demo and even sign up to some degree for the service has really been good. So to see [indiscernible] up units over last year in total units sold is pretty positive for us as we head into selling season in this quarter. Kartik Mehta : And then, Efrain, just maybe this is too early, but any thoughts on changing how you\u2019re managing the full portfolio? The yield curve is getting a little bit steeper, but have you made any changes or any thoughts on maybe the next few months? Efrain Rivera : It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s like you were looking over my shoulder when I was scribbling notes this morning before the call. There are some things we can do in terms of altering duration. I\u2019m \u2013 Kartik, I want to see where we end up or what \u2013 how things look in the spring. My sense is that interest rates start to float up a bit not significantly, but then on that level of yield curve steep. But yet that level of yield curve steepness, it again probably give us some additional opportunities to think about managing the portfolio slightly differently. The first half of the year, we tended to be pretty conservative in terms of the approach we took. We wanted to see what macro environment we\u2019re in. It looks like maybe next year might be incrementally a little bit better. Kartik Mehta : Perfect. Hope you guys have a great holiday. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Same to you, Kartik. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Jeff Silber : Thanks so much and happy holidays to you both as well. Martin Mucci : Yes, thank you. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Jeff Silber : Thanks. I think one of the surprises in the pandemic has been the growth in new business applications and new startups. I know it\u2019s not necessarily an area that you focused on, but I think you do have some clients there. Are you seeing any impact of that on your business? Efrain Rivera : Well, definitely. We\u2019re \u2013 I mean, part of the unit sales on the small end in particular have been a lot of new business starts. Now, we typically have been very successful at selling brand new businesses on our Paychex and SurePayroll platforms, but then it\u2019s continued to assist us and give us some positive benefit. So yes, we\u2019re seeing it. It has been amazing. I do think, as I said earlier, that cash is available, that\u2019s out there, home equity, these are how new businesses start and people also have decided, believe it or not, that this is sometimes the environment where they want to go ahead and get started because of some big change, either laid off or they see a new opportunity or their existing business does not fit in the \u2013 under the pandemic and people have made switches to get into new things and capitalize on them. I mean new business starts being up, I think high-30% is the last number I\u2019ve seen over last year is pretty amazing. Jeff Silber : Yes. That\u2019s true. And if I could just ask a quick outlook question, Efrain\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Sure. Jeff Silber : In looking at, I guess, it\u2019s the PEO and insurance services, are you expecting growth this year in worksite employees or is that something we won\u2019t see till next year? Thanks. Efrain Rivera : No, we expect growth this year in worksite employees for sure. I would say, Jeff, the other thing that I called out probably when in response to someone\u2019s answer. We are unique in that, we have both an ASO and a PEO and we look at the worksite employees together. And if you look at the growth in worksite employees across both platforms, we\u2019re up year-over-year. So, we\u2019re going to be up year-over-year on the PEO and certainly in terms of where we ended the year. So, we\u2019ll have a nice rebound there. And then, when you put in ASO, we think it should be a pretty good year in terms of worksite employees served by our HR solutions to the point that Marty was making earlier. That\u2019s been a big source of demand this year. Jeff Silber : Okay, great. And stay healthy and safe. Thanks again. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. You too. Martin Mucci : Same to you. Operator : Your next question is from Samad Samana of Jefferies. Samad Samana : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Likewise, happy holidays, like as everybody else wished. Maybe first one, I think the announcement with Fiserv Clover was interesting. So, just maybe help us understand how our relationship like that \u2013 Is that more of a technology partnership or does that \u2013 is there an economic relationship there as well? Efrain Rivera : Well, it\u2019s got a couple of different parts to it. First, it\u2019s a referral relationship. So they, Clover \u2013 what we have always found is many new businesses and we\u2019ve talked a lot about the growth of new business startups start with, obviously, with credit card or merchant processing services, and so \u2013 and then go to payroll and HR, etcetera., later. We established \u2013 with a leader like Fiserv, we have a referral arrangement where they can refer payroll or HR needs that their clients as they sell in merchant services over to us and we have a process \u2013 a pretty streamlined process to get those referrals to our sales team to be able to sell. And then there is a technology piece as well. We have a connection into the Clover system, which I think is an industry-leading system, certainly, where, between our Flex platform and the Clover system, the demographic information, the employee information, for example, you add a new employee on the Clover system and you\u2019re using Flex payroll or HR, that will automatically sync with the Flex system. And in addition, we saw an opportunity with Clover with time and attendance. Clover users for Fiserv use a lot of time and attendance. We have industry-leading time and attendance solutions, a number of them. You can clock in and clock out on the Clover system, but you can then look in Flex and see who is on \u2013 who is punched in, who is there, who is out, you can shift swap, you can also look and see if they\u2019re approaching overtime requirements, you can do a number of things. And we\u2019re going to continue to advance this to the point where if you\u2019re a Clover client and have signed up with Clover and you start, you can actually \u2013 you\u2019ll be able to in the future \u2013 near future, be able to sign up with Paychex in a self-service mode, just be able to sign right up for payroll yourself right over the Clover system. So it\u2019s a referral arrangement now, a technical arrangement with connection. It has great opportunity for us on the payroll side and time and attendance and other products as well. Samad Samana : Thank you very much for that, guys. And maybe just a follow-up, Efrain, if I think about the strong bookings commentary for the last several quarters I know you\u2019ve mentioned that digital sales have been a big contributor. How should we think about \u2013 are there any interesting dynamics that you\u2019ve seen on the cohorts that have been coming through digital versus direct sales? And any interesting retention trends or the size of the average customer just as we think about this being something that may be structurally sticky going forward as well? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Early on the retention side, so you need a years worth of experience to really kind of get a sense of that. So, we don\u2019t anticipate that it will be different. I do think that, and I\u2019ve said this to a number of you, it does skew smaller. That\u2019s part of it, but that may also be a function of the environment we\u2019re in. So, it may be that with this amount of new start-ups that Marty mentioned, we\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019re getting a lot of the mix has shifted a little bit smaller than we would otherwise see, but it does tend to be smaller. We\u2019re hopeful, obviously, over time that in the relationship with Paychex, we can nurture them. Marty mentioned I think in his comments, I mean we really take a lot of care with customers and our analytics are such that we can help a small business navigate some of the storm. Obviously, a lot of them go out of business, so you can\u2019t do that. But I would say in terms of the ability to interact with a provider \u2013 a solution provider that can maximize your chances of doing your best, there is really kind of no finer solution on the market. Samad Samana : Great. Very helpful. Good to see the quotes for calendar 2020 and what would happen in 2021. Have a happy holiday season. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Mark Marcon of Baird. Mark Marcon : Hey, good morning, and happy holidays, Marty and Efrain. Efrain Rivera : Yes, thanks. Martin Mucci : Thanks Mark. Mark Marcon : Hey. So, just following up on the bookings question, when we think about more units in terms of the smaller units that are coming to us through, combined with some of the pressures on some of the bigger units and less switching activity, how do you think that balances out? When we think about \u2013 I fully appreciate, in fiscal Q3, we\u2019re going to have some of the dynamics that you mentioned in terms of the employees within the existing accounts, but when we just think about new employees coming on from new units on the whole, how do you think that compares in fiscal Q1 relative to a year ago \u2013 I mean fiscal Q3 relative to a year ago as we get through the selling season? Martin Mucci : Well, it\u2019s a very interesting question, Mark. I think definitely as we\u2019ve said, and I think Efrain has mentioned it and I have, both, the sales have skewed smaller. One, because there\u2019s a lot of brand new businesses as we\u2019ve talked about a couple of times on the call and that the mid-market is a little more hesitant. So \u2013 but the good news that as you look at selling season right now, as I would say is the pipeline looks very healthy. So while we\u2019ve had presentations and there has been some hesitancy to kind of close the deal from the client perspective, I think they\u2019re a little concerned probably waiting to see what Congress does, what kind of stimulus there is, what\u2019s happening with demand. I think between the news of the stimulus, the vaccine and where that standing, multiple vaccines, I do think some of these decisions will start to get closed in this quarter and it\u2019ll still produce a pretty good selling season. We definitely saw improvement in the mid-market from Q1 to Q2 in our sales. And so, while there has been smaller \u2013 the small end has been strong, I do think that the mid-market is picking up speed. It certainly did in the second quarter and we expect it will, given the pipeline in the third quarter. Mark Marcon : Excellent. And then can you just talk a little bit about \u2013 we\u2019re still early days in terms of the reduction in terms of the geographic footprint and the office space and working from home, and it sounds like the Net Promoter Scores just continue to go up. Can you just talk about the efficiency gains that you\u2019ve seen and the productivity gains that you\u2019ve seen from that? And then, hate to ask this, but just any sort of commentary with regards to solar wins and what your checks have shown thus far? Martin Mucci : Yes. No problem at all on that. There is no \u2013 we have \u2013 none of that is in our systems at all. We\u2019ve done a thorough check of that and we feel very good that, that has not impacted us whatsoever. Mark Marcon : Great. Martin Mucci : And on the\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Yes, that is great. Martin Mucci : So then on \u2013 I think the first part of the question, sorry, I jumped into this. Efrain Rivera : Yes. The first part, Marty, was just about the efficiency that we\u2026 Martin Mucci : Yes, I\u2019m sorry. So yes, we\u2019ve been very \u2013 I mean, very impressed with the employee team. On the service side, in particular, we have found that who have had less experience working from home, we certainly added over 1,000 service on the service team working from home pre-pandemic, but they have done just an outstanding job. And Efrain said the Net Promoter Scores continued to increase well year-to-date over last year and the productivity has been very good. So those offices that we closed will remain closed, those that were permanently closed obviously and we will continue to have those service people work from home. It seems to be going extremely well. We\u2019ve gotten positive feedback from the employees on the support and I think there will be continued productivity gains to get there. So, we\u2019ve increased the number of clients that they\u2019ve been able to handle, improve the Net Promoter Score and have the record breaking retention this part \u2013 so far this year. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s working really well and we\u2019ll continue to capitalize on it. Mark Marcon : It sounds like a win-win-win. Happy holidays. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Same to you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo. Tim Willi : Thank you, and good morning. Efrain Rivera : Hi, Tim. Welcome back. Tim Willi : Yes. Thank you. Good to be back. Happy holidays to both of you. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. You too. Tim Willi : Just a question sort of tied into the Clover partners. I guess when you think about all the discussion around business formations, working with a platform like Clover, small business start-ups, and again if you talked about this in prior calls, I apologize, but just sort of thinking about the platform concept and the ease of which people can start a business and who they sort of go-to for maybe some of those initial critical functions, should we think about more Clover-like partnerships? And then just any sort of thoughts about how a sales or service organization has to adapt to that kind of distribution channel I guess, if you see that as an opportunity to acquire and build out the sales channels? Martin Mucci : Well, I think \u2013 look, I think there will still be a number of direct sales opportunities for us obviously, whether that\u2019s, by the way, feet on the street or telephonic or digital sales. Digital, as Efrain mentioned to the question a little bit earlier, digital has worked very well from us where it\u2019s going to get completely to the point of sale setup is available, you can search, demo the product and sign yourself up, that\u2019s already available with our SurePayroll platform and Flex is moving that way as well. So finding new sales channels is always important to us and also making sure that we\u2019re responding and even looking ahead to the way the market wants to do it. The market has changed pretty dramatically and that they wanted \u2013 they\u2019re used to doing things on their own, both the client and the employees of the client, and we were glad to have the innovation that we\u2019ve already done the investments to allow a lot of self-service and that includes right from starting up. Connecting with Clover moved us back in the decision making a little bit earlier, which we\u2019ve always been looking at, which says that, hey, I might not be ready for payroll yet when one of our sales reps directly goes to someone, but what it does is say that, hey, I did get my merchant processing and wow, now I see Paychex show up on the Clover platform that I\u2019m used to. I can transfer my information right now back and forth and very shortly I\u2019ll be able to set up my payroll right from that. So, I do think it\u2019s always about finding new sales channels the way clients want to buy and it is becoming much more of a client-directed, probably always was, but it\u2019s definitely much more now a client-directed decision. Self-service, do it myself, when I want to do it and we\u2019re set up very well with that either directly with Paychex or through partnerships like that. And I think, Yes, you will see more as we find one \u2013 ways to do that. Another example in the back into that is just thinking about the new stimulus loans and the connection I mentioned earlier to Biz2Credit. We\u2019re allowing a client to go in and when they are in their Flex platform doing their payroll, okay, do you want another PPP loan, do you want to apply for one? Yes. Do you want to just move your payroll data and everything right to Biz2Credit so that they can approve your loan probably the same day? Yes. Okay, done. Never talk to anybody, everything was all done digitally and that\u2019s the way of the future. Tim Willi : Thank you very much for the insights. Appreciate it. Happy holidays to you. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Same to you, Tim. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson. Lisa Ellis : Hi. Good morning, guys and happy holidays. A question on this shift you\u2019re seeing with all the new business formation and then the roll off of employees within larger businesses, just a broader question. As this vault through your business assuming it\u2019s going to persist for a period of time, are the unit economics of these smaller businesses typically more attractive, similar to the base? Is there sort of broader kind of business structural dynamics that we should be keeping in mind? Martin Mucci : Well, I think there is two ways to look at it. One, we certainly having been in the business a long time and serving small clients for the longest period of time, we know how to obviously make a great profit from that as you know from our margins. And so the small businesses, we can do very profitably, and in fact, probably even more so today with the digital stuff that we\u2019ve been \u2013 the digital investments we\u2019ve talked about right through to self-service. We\u2019re making it so much more productive to sign up a new small client. Then, when you think of the mid-market, the opportunity there is obviously for much more revenue penetration of the additional services that we offer these days. So, while the cost to set up and serve maybe slightly what will be maybe more, the revenue opportunity is more. So that\u2019s very profitable. So we don\u2019t see any major changing of the dynamics there. In fact, it\u2019s probably given us \u2013 the investments we\u2019ve made have given us an opportunity to continue to earn well. Even if prices come down a little bit on the small end due to competition, we\u2019ve taken more costs out of the setup in the ongoing service that have still \u2013 that have really appealed to those clients because that\u2019s the way they want to be served. And then on the mid-market, the enhancement of the products that we offer gives us a much bigger share of revenue per client in the mid-market. Lisa Ellis : Okay. And then my follow-up is another question on the Clover partnership. Just thinking about their \u2013 the size of that installed customer base is probably similar in scale to your installed base. Is there an initial part of that partnership aimed at kind of cross-selling, identifying Clover clients that aren\u2019t Paychex\u2019s clients and vice versa to \u2013 that might create like an initial pretty heavy lift from that relationship? Or is it more focused on sort of \u2013 should we be thinking about it is more like incremental over time new sales-oriented? Martin Mucci : No, at least we\u2019re hoping so. We\u2019re \u2013 obviously, there is the cross-selling right off the bat, so yes, Clover is reaching out to their client base immediately and letting them know when they\u2019ve already started issuing emails to their client base to say, hey, we\u2019re connected to Paychex, this is an easy set up to go to Paychex, we will transfer data back and forth, you have Flex and Clover in sync. So I \u2013 we\u2019re hoping that there\u2019ll be some initial jump in success right off the bat with that, and then we\u2019re certainly excited about, on an ongoing basis, being on that Clover platform as they\u2019re \u2013 I think they\u2019ve been very successful at adding new clients to it. Lisa Ellis : Terrific. Thank you, and happy holidays, guys. Thanks a lot. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Same to you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Pete Christiansen of Citi. Pete Christiansen : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Hi, Pete. Pete Christiansen : Hi. Martin Mucci : Yes. Thank you. Pete Christiansen : Two quick ones here. So Marty, I was just \u2013 how are you thinking about the absolute level of go-to-market spending relative to other periods? How aggressive is Paychex being right now? And what are you seeing on the ROI front? And then my follow-up question is, on the PEP, is there a difference in the economics, the unit economics, and how should we think about that? Thank you, gentlemen. Martin Mucci : Sure. On the first one, I think the go-to-market spend, we\u2019ve increased our marketing spend pretty consistently. You may have seen we\u2019ve also gotten into TV advertising even for the brand and getting the brand out there. It was helpful to us during the beginning of the pandemic and it is continued to be. So when I think we\u2019ll continue that, it\u2019s not a massive amount of TV advertising, I\u2019m not sure it always is worth a bit. If some ROI, there is some breakeven there, that\u2019s hard to predict. But we are getting more leads that seem to be following the advertising that we\u2019re doing, and I think there is opportunity there. The investments that we\u2019ve already made in go-to-market from the webinars, from the information, we have really enhanced that this year under COVID, and I think it has brought a lot of clients to us. If you think about a webinar on the original stimulus package or I\u2019m sure of one coming up that will have on this stimulus package, those webinars used to bring different information, webinars used to bring a couple of hundred clients, prospects and CPAs, maybe 400, 500, now they\u2019re bringing 6,000, 7,000, 10,000, which gives you a lot of leads, certainly gets your brand out there and your product set, but also a lot more leads because you have that information once they signed up for the webinars. So they\u2019ve been extremely successful at a pretty low cost, frankly. So I think a good ROI return of our investment there. On the PEP, just quickly, I think the economics are very good there. It\u2019s a little bit lower cost, you\u2019re a little bit more, and there\u2019s probably a little bit more retention to that plan because you\u2019re more involved, you\u2019re not just a record keeper but you\u2019re the fiduciary. And I think it\u2019s going to be a lot stickier from a sale that we have on 401(k) and we\u2019re very successful at selling 401(k) plans. And this, instead of telling the client, hey, we\u2019re going to be a record keeper but here is \u2013 you\u2019re going to go to a financial advisor to do this or that, we can now say, look, we\u2019ll set up basically the whole thing for you with some partnerships and we can take care of all of it at a lower cost. So the economics we feel are still going to be very good. There is always a risk of some cannibalization of single-employer plans, but I think there is going to be a world for both of them that are out there and we may capture a lot more customers, prospects that have not had a 401(k) but now will jump in. Pete Christiansen : Thank you very much. That\u2019s great. Martin Mucci : Okay, Pete. Efrain Rivera : You are welcome. Operator : Your next question is from Bryan Bergin of Cowen. Bryan Bergin : Hi, good morning. Thank you. First, I wanted to clarify on client retention, are you assuming that it\u2019s going to remain at record levels in your second half outlook? And Marty, to your comments on being pleased with the sequential improvement, but at a more moderate pace near the end of the quarter, can you dig into that a little bit more on what KPIs specifically are you seeing moderate? Martin Mucci : Yes. So I think on the client retention, right now, we expect that it will \u2013 that we\u2019ll stay at record-breaking. The issue really is the non-processing clients. We talked about them in the first quarter. They have come down dramatically from the first quarter, meaning that there was clients that didn\u2019t leave us but they suspended payroll processing, but stayed with us as a client and we worked very hard to keep them as a client even if they were suspended. They\u2019re now paying for that service to be \u2013 to kind of hang in there. It\u2019s dropped dramatically, in fact, it\u2019s continue to drop, but we\u2019re trying to see if this last number of non-processing clients and it\u2019s a pretty small number compared to our base. What will happen at year-end? Are they hanging in for year-end or not? That\u2019s the only thing, Bryan, that we\u2019re kind of watching is to whether if they all left then we probably wouldn\u2019t hit retention. We\u2019d still have a very strong retention number, but it wouldn\u2019t be record-breaking. I think they\u2019re \u2013 the fact that they\u2019re still on the service, they\u2019re just kind of holding in there. You\u2019ve heard of restaurants that are saying, hey, I\u2019m going to just close still spring, particularly in the Northeast and kind of hang in there. So that\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s going to be record breaking through the year, but it could be closed depending on what happens with the stimulus. At the end of what I was saying with the moderation is that, like there was a lot of new business formation. And when you think about the quarter, September, October, November, September saw a lot of influx of new sales, particularly on the small end, because of households. So you had the start of a school year \u2013 most school years started in September. You had nanny \u2013 you had nannies, you had tutors, you had a lot of things. So we saw a big explosion of small sales like \u2013 that are small household sales in September. It\u2019s just starting to moderate as people are kind of fitting into a new reality of the pandemic. So it moderated some. Still growth \u2013 still seeing growth, it just wasn\u2019t quite as explosive, I guess I\u2019d say at the first month or two of the quarter. Bryan Bergin : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then can you comment on your sales head count. Just how that has progressed here in 2020? Martin Mucci : Yes, pretty flat. We went up a little bit in head count, low single digits for overall sales and we\u2019ve continued to mix \u2013 while pre-pandemic, we continued to mix and plan for in-house sales, telephonic sales and online sales versus feet on the street. Obviously, they were pretty much all telephonic or digital now. But head count is up a few percentage points and doing very well, particularly when you think about, we\u2019ve sold more units than second quarter last year as we mentioned in everybody\u2019s home, it\u2019s been pretty amazing. Bryan Bergin : Thanks guys. Happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Alright. Thanks Bryan, you too. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Tien- tsin Huang : Thanks so much. Just wanted to clarify on the change in the outlook, obviously, the second quarter was better than expected. Did the composition of your second half outlook changed at all, just curious if I missed anything there? Martin Mucci : No, I think it just \u2013 it I would say Tien-tsin it\u2019s just got a little bit better than where we were at the last call. And I suspect we will have more to say when we get to third quarter [indiscernible] season. So I would say it incrementally changed. Tien- tsin Huang : Got it. And then just with the ASO strength you noted and to the year of demand for HR services, I think you had mentioned Efrain \u2013 do you expect to sort of maybe put a little bit more energy into selling that versus 90 days ago? Efrain Rivera : I think there\u2019s just a lot of demand as Marty has alluded. In some ways we have \u2013 we\u2019ve placed a lot of emphasis on sales in that area and the market is generating demand in that area. So you got a good confluence of both factors. Martin Mucci : Yes, I think one thing I\u2019d add Tien-tsin is that, really starting last year sometime, Mark Bottini and the sales team, they\u2019ve really put an effort out to say it\u2019s a power of 3,000, so all sales were leading with that HR value that we could bring. So instead of we\u2019ve really moved from the traditional model of selling payroll, but then coming back with everything else. And I think that helped us a lot pre-pandemic and it really helped us with the momentum of the demand going up for HR. Because anybody, if I mean they\u2019re talking to you about retirement, I\u2019m also telling you about ASO and PEO that\u2019s available to you and the value it brings. If I\u2019m selling you payroll, I\u2019m also talking about ASO and PEO. So it really has helped and so there has been a very high energy in the sales force, an opportunity for them all to sell HR and it was perfect timing. Tien- tsin Huang : Yes, great. Glad to see their hard work coming through. Have a blessed holiday guys. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Thanks. You too. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Matthew O\u2019Neill of Goldman Sachs. Matthew O\u2019Neill: Yes. Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for squeezing me and I know the call is getting long and happy holidays as well. Don\u2019t mean to belabor the questions on FI serving Clover. But was curious on two fronts similar Lisa\u2019s question. One, when you guys were working on initiating this relationship, was there an immediate identification of a good overlap of existing Paychex and Clover clients and providing the technological connectivity was something being asked for? Or was it really more sort of all offensive as far as this could be a great referral channel going forward? And then just to round out. Is there any sort of two way street element here? I understand that people are making probably a credit card processing decision potentially before a payroll decision. But are you guys able to help sell the Clover product on the other side of your existing clients? Thanks. Martin Mucci : Yes, in fact, we\u2019ve been selling merchant processing with a number of partners and Fiserv of being a major one for some time. It stayed a small part of our business, because of what you just said. Typically they have merchant processing already, but we\u2019ve been able to sometimes offer them better rates. Those rates can be very confusing and if we have payroll clients, we talked to them, we have been for a number of years, talking to them about merchant processing and we resell basically their products. So yes, there will be back and forth referral going both ways between us and it was \u2013 I think it was mostly offensive. We\u2019ve always known that with this connection, because we sold merchant as well as payroll. And so we look for a partner, we thought that Fiserv particularly lately the Clover system is very strong and is very well penetrated. And I also mentioned earlier that, we found that probably over 30% of their clients have time and attendance solutions that are tied in with their point of sale Clover equipment and that we have very strong time and attendance solutions that can tie directly to the Clover equipment along with the payroll Flex platform. So we felt that from an offensive perspective to pick up referrals for payroll and it was positive for the connection that we could make, we could also enhance what Clover offers by giving them not only a payroll platform that\u2019s tied in with the system, but time and attendance in a number of other products as well and the demand for HR obviously is typically there for those who are using those point of sale systems. So a lot of wins all the way around, we feel it will bring us. Matthew O\u2019Neill: Makes sense. Thanks so much. Martin Mucci : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Today\u2019s final question is coming from Scott Wurtzel of Wolfe Research. Scott Wurtzel : Hi, good morning, guys. This is Scott on for Darrin Peller. Just had one question on sort of the structural positioning for the long-term. You mentioned that expenses were down this quarter related to lower discretionary spending and reduced facility costs or kind of a mix of short and longer term cost savings. And we are just wondering, if you\u2019re still \u2013 if you are planning on doing more kind of cost savings on the longer-term side? Martin Mucci : Well, I think and Efrain can comment on this. So obviously, we\u2019re always looking at that, Scott, we\u2019re always looking at. We\u2019ve got a history of having the best margins in the business, we\u2019re really pleased that during this kind of pandemic environment that we could maintain and improve our margins. And I think that we have been successful at making changes that respond to the market, but also make us more efficient. So yes, we\u2019ll continue to look for ways to reduce costs and make us more productive and make the service and products even better. I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for self-service that clients are looking for and their employees were well invested in that already with a five star mobile app and all of our products being mobile first designed and I think we\u2019re going to see continued savings there as well. Scott Wurtzel : Got it. And then on the revenue side, are you seeing more sustainable opportunities may be for more sticky revenue to lift the based on the other side of the pandemic? Martin Mucci : Well, I think the HR. Yes, I think \u2013 I mentioned at the beginning of the call. I think one of the things that the pandemic has done for us and our clients is, they\u2019ve been able to see the full value of being with Paychex. They\u2019ve been able to use products and services and count on us for more HR support than they wouldn\u2019t normally need in a non-kind of pandemic situation. And so I think it\u2019s going to provide us better retention of all of the products, because we\u2019ve had an opportunity for them to see that we can be there in a tough situation and really support them. And frankly get a lot of feedback from clients that we help them through the pandemic into \u2013 and to help their business survive. So we do feel that the products will have even better retention coming out of this, because we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate the full value. Scott Wurtzel : Great. Thanks for taking my question guys and happy holidays. Martin Mucci : Thank you. You too. Operator : Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Mucci for any additional or closing remarks. Martin Mucci : Alright, thank you. At this point, we will close the call. If you\u2019re interested in playing the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 90 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in the second quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. We do wish you a very safe and happy holiday. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Martin Mucci. Please go ahead. Martin Mucci : Thank you. And thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex third quarter fiscal '21 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. And this morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2021. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days.  This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet, will be archived and available on our website for about 90 days. I will start today's call with an update on the business highlights for the third quarter and then Efrain will review our third quarter financial results and provide an update on our outlook for fiscal 2021. We will then open it up for your questions.  It is hard to believe that it's been over a year since the beginning of the mass shutdowns in response to COVID-19. This past year has been different from any other that we've experienced before. You know, new challenges have forced us to find innovative ways to connect with our clients, prospects, and our own employees. I'm very proud of how the Paychex team embraced these challenges and took a leadership role throughout this pandemic as evidenced by the newly released Sapient Insights Group Annual HR Survey just coming out this week that ranked Paychex Flex, our SaaS-based cloud application, number one among all solution providers as rated by their Voice of the Customer report in both user experience and client satisfaction scores.  Our results for the third quarter reflect strong retention in client based growth across all of our lines of business, most notably in our ASO HR outsourcing business. We completed the selling season with strength in our virtual, digital, and HR outsourcing sales driven by new business starts and the increasing need for HR support.  Our traditional sales channels have been impacted by headwinds arising from restrictions on face-to-face meetings and delayed decision-making by the prospects. However, we've seen growth in key sales metrics, including sales presentations and close rates, which have continued in March as well as increases in win rates versus our competitors. We are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities as we transition back to a normal market condition.  As Efrain will discuss in more detail, with less than a quarter remaining in our fiscal year, we are proud of the fact that our total service revenue for the year will be roughly flat to last fiscal year after the major impact of businesses during the pandemic.  Our initiatives to reduce expenses while accelerating our investment in the innovation of our products and service delivery has not only maintained our industry-leading profit margins but has positioned us well for growth as the pandemic situation improves. We have delivered solid client growth and demonstrated our unique value to our clients and partners through some of the most difficult times.  Throughout every stage of the pandemic, we have demonstrated our commitment to helping clients with our multifaceted approach response, which includes a comprehensive COVID Online Help Center, state-specific resources, educational webinars, product innovations, in-app Paycheck Protection Program tools, specialized employee training and more. Our efforts were recognized not only by our clients in the form of strong client satisfaction scores and retention, but we were also recently honored as the 2021 Silver Winner of a Stevie Award for the most valuable COVID-19 response. We continue to listen to and work with small and mid-sized businesses to provide the information, resources, and support they need.  A recent Paychex survey to these businesses revealed that three of the biggest obstacles facing small and mid-sized business owners are financial instability, planning the return to office, and employer vaccination policies. While financial instability is the biggest concern, the government stimulus pay plans have been very effective in helping small and mid-sized businesses stay afloat.  Paychex has continued to build on its portfolio of PPP solutions in real time as new government relations are passed. To date, we have assisted our clients in quickly applying for and obtaining over $60 billion in PPP loans. We have also helped them claim approximately $1.5 billion in paid leave and employee retention tax credits.  Paychex Flex is the first HR software solution to introduce integrated tools to help businesses maximize tax credits, while not impacting PPP loan forgiveness.  Our experienced HR professionals help our clients by delivering effective recommendations based on our clients' unique circumstances and business needs. These new challenges include assisting in navigating the complex stimulus legislation, developing return to office plans, creating vaccination policies, and the data analytics and tools to support employee recruitment and retention in this difficult time. The complexity of these issues has resulted in higher demand for HR outsourcing as more clients recognize the advantage of putting our expertise to work for them.  In recent months, this increased demand has contributed to strong growth in our ASO business, as businesses are looking for more immediate HR support, but some reluctance to make changes to the employee benefits by selecting the PEO model. We do expect that as businesses begin to evaluate their options and implement benefit decisions, there will be a more normalized mix of ASO and PEO product selection.  We announced on the last call that we were introducing our new pooled employer plan or PEP. This new product is a cost-effective retirement plan designed to expand retirement plan access with reduced administration for employers. We have been very pleased with the reception of this new offering in the market, and after just a few short months have approximately 2000 new clients on PEP.  We believe that recent mandates in California requiring retirement benefits for employees will lead to even more interest in our PEP product and other retirement solutions. Paychex remains the top record keeper for retirement plans, originating the most new plans annually.  We also announced our integration with Fiserv's Clover point-of-sale systems. We offer integrated payroll and time and attendance for small business retailers via a new app in the Clover App Market. Integration is now complete and existing Paychex customers can download the app to allow for time and attendance to be handled within the Clover system, with seamless integration with Paychex Flex. This integration increases cross-selling opportunities for both companies and significantly enhances the client experience for shared customers.  In addition, we launched several enhancements to our data analytics in Paychex Flex, including a Diversity and Equal Pay live report that builds upon our recently released EEO-1 compliance solution to give administrators the ability to analyze their pay and diversity data, allowing businesses to uncover opportunities to create a more diverse and equitable workforce. Our innovative solutions continue to receive industry recognition. We were recognized by the Business Intelligence Group, earning a 2021 Big Innovation Award for being a leader in real time payments. And last May, we were the first HR solutions provider to offer real time payments, giving businesses more freedom and flexibility.  I'm very proud of the two awards that Paychex has been honored with recently. For the 13th time, Ethisphere named us one of the 2021 world's most ethical companies and we are also on the Fortune's list of World's Most Admired Companies. These awards acknowledge our commitment to ethical business practices, values-based culture, innovation, social responsibility and leadership as well as our support for the business community and its employees throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  I give credit to the innovation, integrity and hard work of our employees who have continued to show up for our clients, even while navigating the challenges of the pandemic in their own lives. As we enter our second year with COVID, we remain diligent in helping businesses continue to navigate the pandemic and remain hopeful that the worst is behind us. We are confident that our resilient business model, strong financial position, and dedicated employees will help Paychex to finish fiscal year 2021 even stronger than we started it.  I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results for the third quarter. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Marty. Hello, everyone, on the call. Good morning. I'd like to remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements. You know where to look for those disclosures. And please refer to them.  In addition, I'll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, et cetera. Please refer to our press release again and our investor presentation for more information on these measures.  I will start by providing some of the key points for the quarter. And then I'll follow up with some greater detail in certain areas and then I'll wrap with a review of our fiscal 2021 outlook. And some initial thoughts on fiscal 2022. Our third quarter results reflect the impact of economic conditions resulting from COVID. For the third quarter, service revenue of $1.1 billion decreased 2% compared to the prior year, largely due to a lower volume of client employees paid across our HCM solutions. As a reminder, our third quarter includes certain annual revenue streams that declined due to lower employment.  Total revenue declined 3% to $1.1 billion, impacted by decline in interest on funds held for clients. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue was even at $847 million and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue declined 8% to $250 million.  Interest on funds held for clients decreased 29% for the quarter to $15 million due to lower average interest rates and realized gains. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients were consistent with the prior year.  Expenses were down 4% to $643 million. The decline in expenses were driven by lower discretionary spending, reduced facilities costs, and lower amortization of intangible assets.  Operating income was flat at $469 million and reflected an operating margin of 42.2%, a 100 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter.  Our effective income tax was 24.2% for the third quarter compared to 23.6% for the same period last year. Both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation payments that occur with the exercise of stock option awards.  Adjusted net income decreased 1% to $349 million for the quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share also decreased 1% during the quarter to $0.96 per share.  Year-to-date, service revenue declined 3% to $3 billion, with Management Solutions revenue declining 1% and PEO and Insurance declining 6%. Interest on funds held for clients declined 27% to $45 million. Total revenue declined 3% to $3 billion.  Operating income decreased 5% to $1.1 billion and adjusted operating income decreased 2% to $1.1 billion reflecting a margin of 37.6%, an improvement of 50 basis points compared to the prior-year period.  Adjusted operating margin excludes one-time costs of $32 million related to acceleration of cost savings initiatives, including the long-term strategy to reduce our geographic footprint and headcount optimization, the majority of which was recognized during the first quarter.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 3% to $2.32.  Turning to our investment portfolio, our primary goal is to protect principle and optimize liquidity, as we've mentioned frequently. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield currently of 1.9% and an average duration of 3.4 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.1% for the quarter, down from 1.8% last year. Those were the good days.  I will now walk through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong. Cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments are $1.1 billion and total borrowings were $804 million as of February 28, 2021.  Funds held for clients as of the same date, February 28, 2021, were $4.2 billion and increased from $3.4 billion as of May 31, 2020. Funds held for clients, as you know, vary widely on a day-to-day basis and average $4.5 billion for the third quarter.  Our total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $82 million as of February 28, 2021. That compares to $100 million as of May 31, 2020. The decrease in that gain position resulted from increases in longer-term yields during the nine-month period.  Total stockholders' equity was $3 billion as of February 28, reflecting $671 million in dividends paid and $78 million of shares repurchased during the first nine months. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 37%. Cash flows from operations were $871 million for the first nine months. That was a decrease from the same period last year. The decrease was driven by lower net income and fluctuations in working capital, including an increase in purchased accounts receivables due to continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and growth in the business, offset by an increase in worksite employees' payroll-related liabilities.  Now, I'm going to turn to guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2021. The outlook reflects our current thinking regarding the speed and timing of the economic robbery. It does not assume any acceleration due to government stimulus. It rather assumes current course and speed of the recovery.  Results for the first nine months of the fiscal year exceeded expectations. However, certainty about the pace of the recovery over the remainder of the year remains. We have provided the following updates to our guidance.  After seeing the third quarter results, Management Solutions revenue growth year-over-year is expected to be in the range of flat to growth of 2%. We previously guided to a range of decline to 1% to growth of 1%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to decline in the range of 2% to 5%. This is unchanged from prior guidance. We're now providing guidance on total service revenues. This is total service revenue, not total revenue, which is now expected to be in the range of a decline of 1% to growth of 1%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be between $55 million to $65 million, and this is unchanged from prior guidance.  Total revenue is expected to be in the range of a decline of 2% to flat. We previously guided to a range of a decline of 3% of flat.  Adjusted operating income as a percent of total revenue is now anticipated to be in the range of 36% to 37%, up from previous guidance of approximately 36%.  Adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year fiscal 2021 is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%. up from approximately 41%. Other expense net is anticipated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million, unchanged from previous guidance. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 24%, while we previously guided to approximately 24%. And adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of a decline of 2% to flat. We previously guided to a decline in the range of 1% to 4%. Obviously, we need to go through the fourth quarter to see where the year ends, but we're really pleased with our ability to manage through the P&L impacts of the pandemic, especially loss of variable revenue, which as you all know, carries a high margin. We offset much of that, including a decline in interest on funds held for clients. And if there's any doubt about our ability to manage the P&L, I think that this year, we showed some of the skeptics on that.  Now, turning to the fourth quarter and fiscal year, we currently anticipated total service revenue growth will be in the range of 7% to 9%. Remember, I said total service revenue growth. To get total, you need to understand the next one, which is interest on funds held for clients expected to be approximately $15 million, consistent with previous quarters. That is interest on funds held is consistent with previous quarters. Obviously, in the fourth quarter, we expect to see a sharp rebound from what we've experienced in the first three quarters and a return to growth.  Adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33% to 34%.  Now we're also currently in the process of preparing our annual plan for fiscal year 2022. So, now we'll lead. Others haven't talked about it, we'll talk about it. And wanted to give you some indications of what our thinking is. We'll provide more complete guidance for fiscal 2022 during our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter call in June, but I want to provide some very preliminary color on our initial thoughts around fiscal 2022 in this call. With those caveats, we believe that total service revenue growth will be in the range of 6% to 7%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million and does not assume any significant change in interest rates. Obviously, we've got a lot of work to do with thinking about the right way to position the portfolio, but this is where we're at right now. We also anticipate that adjusted operating margin will be approximately 37% and that the effective tax rate will be in the range of 24% to 25%.  Let me just say one thing on that. As you know, we typically will exclude our benefits from stock comp exercised at this point. We're not baking any here. We probably will get some benefit, but too early to call.  Now, if as if that wasn't enough of a caveat, all of this is subject to our current assumptions, which are subject to change. And we will update you again on the fourth quarter call after we have gone through the fourth quarter.  I'll refer you to our investor slides on our website for additional information. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Marty. Martin Mucci : Thank you, Efrain. Operator, at this point, we will open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI. David Togut : Two questions, please. First, if you could quantify some of the key performance indicators a little bit more, for example, client retention. Marty, you I think referred to some delays in sales cycles. Can you kind of walk through the booking trends you saw in the quarter? And then, my follow-up is really around the receivables balance, which was up 81% versus the May balance sheet. And perhaps, Efrain, you can talk a little bit more about kind of the purchased accounts receivables, what are the terms around that? Efrain Rivera : Let me talk to that, David. As many of you know, we have a business that provides funding for staffing firms. And those of you who cover the staffing industry, there's a number of you that know that in the last quarter of the year, let's call it April, May, and June, basically, staffing was flat on its back. What happened was that we weren't providing any lending because there was no lending to be provided to staffing firms, and as a consequence, the receivables balance was very low. Our cash flow was very high in the last quarter. What's happened is that trend persisted through the first half of the year, and then staffing came roaring back, starting in January. And in particular, really in the month of February, as there was a ramp up in a number of areas in staffing including healthcare. So, at the end of the quarter, we had purchased significantly more receivables than we had anticipated when the year started. But on an average basis, we're only about 4%, 5% above where we were last year. So, it's a little bit of an artifact of the decline in staffing followed by a sharp rebound. That number will come down significantly in the fourth quarter. So, that's what's happening on receivables.  So, you had three questions there. I think the other ones were retention and bookings growth. Martin Mucci : David, on the sales side, yeah, I think what we've seen is an improvement, particularly toward the end of the quarter, which has continued now into March on sales opportunities. So, we\u2019re getting in front of clients for presentations. What we've seen throughout the first half of the year and into the selling season was really a lot of no decisions. So, we get in front of clients, but they're just not ready to make a move. And so, we're starting to see now a little bit of that open up in the last month or so. And so, we\u2019re getting good opportunities in front of clients. Actually, our win rates, where they make a decision, we're doing better against competitors than we have in the past, and sales results kind of year-to-date are pretty much on track for the year as to kind of what we expected, but I think that we're seeing improvements now and things starting to open up. One of the tough things that played against that was just not getting more enough face to face with clients. Certainly, always put a little bit of a dampening effect on \u2013 particularly on the selling season where we have so many units that come in that way. The positives have been digital. We increased our marketing and got a lot more digital sales, so coming in over through the web, selling telephonically, selling online. So, we've seen that and that's helped. That's been really helped by new business starts, which are up I think double digits year-over-year, and so we're taking advantage of that. So, everything is improving, but it did have some dampening effect on selling season not getting in front of people. We're now opening that up and getting out with prospects face to face as they're comfortable and reps are comfortable. That's starting to pick up.  ASO, very strong. HR needs very strong, as you would expect, just in all the things that I already described. How do I continue to handle work from home, how do I handle return to office, how do I handle a vaccination, what do I require to do that? So, big growth, very strong double-digit growth in ASO.  But on the PEO side, as I mentioned, a little bit slower because they haven't really wanted to change. You go back to this kind of no decision thing. You haven't seen as many businesses wanting to get into insurance, and change their insurance right now or their benefit plans, given that that's kind of the least of their concerns. And so, we think that'll normalize going forward, but very strong in HR performance, HR sales on the ASO side, very strong on the digital side and telephonic sales, and starting to pick up on all of the opportunities and win rates. On the client retention, on track really for the best retention in our history. We have very strong client retention. Again, I think some of that \u2013 and certainly, we're getting help from clients saying, 'hey I'm getting great value from Paychex with the help on the PPP loans.' I mentioned, we've helped facilitate through Biz2Credit, our partner and other banks and so forth with our innovation in the Flex product. We've helped facilitate over $60 billion in our clients to get loans from the PPP program. And what's really picked up now in the last even few months is employee retention tax credits. We have helped tremendously. That means we go back and re-file some of the 941s to help them apply for those credits, and that has taken off very quickly as well. So, clients are feeling \u2013 it's a great time for us to show the complete value of what Paychex expertise brings to them, and that has really helped client retention to be extremely strong right now.  We have the best net client gain. You know we don't give specific numbers on clients until the end of the year, but we had the best net client gain in the third quarter, I think, in our history, at least in the last four or five years anyway, with a combination of sales and retention. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: Thanks for the early view on fiscal 2022. That's super appreciated. Can you help us think through kind of the key drivers of PEO performance next year? What are the sort of pressure points in that business that need to lift to see it return to a sort of a more normalized growth profile? I think you just mentioned a reticence for customers to change providers. I think in the past, you've mentioned some hospitality over-indexing in that industry vertical. Sort of what the end market conditions have to be in order to see that segment return to a more normalized growth profile? Martin Mucci : I think, one, it is indexed a little higher on the hospitality side and particularly on the Oasis acquisition that we did and concentrated in, of course, southern states. And so, I think as you see the hospitality come back, the stimulus that are out there now and that are picking up, the new grants, in particular, for restaurants and bars, hotels, et cetera, that are out there, these grants, not loans but grants, are going to be given out. I think all these things are going to help kind of bring hospitality back. And of course, just the opening up of more states and more restaurants to either expanded capacity or full capacity, I think, will bring that back, and that will drive, certainly, more of the PEO who tend to go \u2013 those clients tend to go that way. The other thing is I just think more comfort in getting their employees back into the business place. Now, they're going to be interested in, 'okay, how do I get employees back? How do I retain them? How do I recruit them?' Benefit plans are going to become very interesting again for them. And I think the more complexity of those benefit plans and how competitive they are is going to be very important to them. So, I think the stimulus, the opening and the bounce-back in hospitality, which is coming toward the later end of some of the stimulus, and the need to have very strong benefit plans, I think we'll start to see the PEO pick back up and a lot of interest from prospects. Ramsey El-Assal: A follow-up for me is, I wonder if you could kind of update us on the relative importance in the business now of kind of cross-selling to existing customers versus signing up new ones. Has the model kind of evolved in the context of the pandemic to being more reliant on expanding wallet share rather than signing up de novo clients simply because there's been a lot of pressure in that area in the economy? Martin Mucci : It's an interesting question. We've gone the last number of years, two to three years, with really talking about the power of 3,000 sales reps, which is our reps across all divisions, and our traditional model of selling payroll and then coming back in after has changed quite a lot in our go-to-market strategy. We saw that we were leaving money on the table and value for our clients on the table. So, we sell HR complete benefit packages upfront or at least make sure that they're aware of that, and that hasn't changed all that dramatically during the pandemic. It's been harder to get full interest. So, I think we've been good about coming back around and selling other products, but I think leading with HR actually was very important during the pandemic. And you can see that in, really, the double-digit growth that we've seen in the sales of ASO because you could go in and talk \u2013 if we were just going in and pushing payroll first over the last year during the pandemic, I don't think we would have been as successful as \u2013 that we've been trained to have our salespeople talk about HR and how we can help them completely, not just with payroll, and that has really helped us. So, I'd say that, actually, we stayed with the full HR value, and that has been a lot of our success during the pandemic because that was the real need for our clients and our prospects. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Marty, you talked about an increase in win rates against competitors. Maybe can you help us kind of understand that a little bit, maybe how much of that is just a better service through the pandemic versus more competitive product? And is there any part of the client base you'd call out in terms of, obviously, towards the lower end or kind of midmarket? Just any thoughts on that because that's an interesting development. Martin Mucci : Kevin, I think what we've seen is, first of all, the innovation in the product. We have such a complete product set now in the SaaS-based cloud Flex platform. And I think our document management has been very popular. And we've seen the big increase in. The mobile app being five-star, continues to be five-star, and an increased use of that in self-service by our clients. And I think selling, going back to the go-to-market of selling HR completely, I think if you went back two years, they still saw selling payroll upfront versus our competitors selling an integrated HR and payroll and the HR focus that we've put the last two years has really positioned us very well. We've also done more using sales engineers in the midmarket to demo the product and have experts demoing the product earlier in the process. And I think that also has shown the full value of Flex.  And then just on top of it, I just think our employees' response, both in our IT, our product development, our marketing, to COVID and how we've helped clients has really positioned us well versus some of our competitors who are just not as large and as fully capable. You go back to that number, we've helped our clients get $60 billion in PPP loans. That was all responding to stimulus like the day it was out or the day after it was out, partnering with Biz2Credit and other financial players who could get them the loans quickly. I think clients really saw the strength of a Paychex brand through all the things that we're doing like that. And that has helped us against competitors that, hey, may have been selling technology, but certainly didn't have the compliance or the experience and the wherewithal that our resources have. Kevin McVeigh : Efrain, real quick, if you think about the margin \u2013 and thanks for the preliminary 2022 \u2013 does that dial in some normalization of cost? Or how should we think about maybe some structural cost savings coming out of COVID? Or does that, again, assume some uptick of costs coming back into the business? Or is there any way to think about that? Efrain Rivera : Kevin, I get that question on a fairly frequent basis. So, yes, it does contemplate that some of the variable costs that came out of the business will go back in. So, that's part of our thinking already. But I think we've done a pretty responsible job this year, and I think that we've already started to add back costs, actually, back half of the year to normalize our cost structure, so that next year wouldn't be quite as big an impact as it otherwise would be. So, we've taken that into account.  But I would say this. And I think one of the great lessons of this year, not only for us but for everyone, is that there are pockets of costs that won't come back and that we don't need. And they're not coming back and they're not needed and they won't be in the P&L. So, I think that's why you see \u2013 we exceeded expectations, our own expectations and, certainly, external expectations, on margins. As I said, a lot of the revenue that we were looking at was marginal revenue [technical difficulty] beat that number. And going into next year, we're expecting to leverage further. So, I think that we're comfortable with that cost structure moving forward. It does include continued savings from actions that we took this year, but we've added back some costs. Martin Mucci : I think just to add to that, one of the things that we were already doing before the pandemic and had helped us a great deal because some of the calls coming into payroll specialists and HR specialists that we have were very complex. We've been able, the last two years, to really drive a lot of easier task back to the client who wanted to do them anyway in a self-service perspective. So, when you think about \u2013 we've talked about chatbots. 50% of the service questions that come in online for us are now handled by an automated chatbot that respond to that. Now, 7 by 24 by 365, personal is political, but that has been a tremendous help. The other thing, when you change your direct deposit number or address changes, over 80% of those changes are now done by clients or their employees online through the mobile app or on the desktop. And that has made a tremendous amount of difference in driving operational costs down, and that's the innovation of our operations team, and driven them to the client who wants to do them anyway. So, it's freed up our people to do a lot more and it's reduced cost. Kevin McVeigh : Any sense, if you can answer it, what percentage of clients are totally DIY this quarter? Efrain Rivera : Our total DIY? Kevin McVeigh : Yeah. Efrain Rivera : It's certainly over 50%. And I think the way we think about it is you don't have to be totally DIY to be largely in a DIY service setting. So, probably the number is higher than that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin of Cowen. Bryan Bergin : Curious, how are you thinking about the PPP impact on potential future switching behavior due to the reg and reporting requirements? So, is there any dynamic that can leave the base potentially stickier for an extended period of time? Are you planning for a more normalized switching behavior in fiscal 2022 that you were seeing pre-COVID? Martin Mucci : Great question. I think we're planning for more switching behavior just because I think we have found that many clients, just because of our sales experience, as well as client retention, to be fair, is that people are just kind of buttoned down and not making changes while they've got other things to worry about. But I do think that there's been, certainly, as I mentioned earlier, a great value that clients have seen that they wouldn't normally have been able to see from us, how we facilitated their help or how we facilitated helping them through the innovation of Flex to really pre-populate information, file for their loans, and be able to help them through difficult times. I think that is definitely going to have some retention impacts because we see it in the client satisfaction scores being at an all-time high, great feedback from clients, awards that we've won, the help center online that we've produced. So, I think there will be some stickiness, but we also know that there's just the ability that people are more comfortable and they will now focus on, 'do I need something else, do I grab a discount option to get three months free,' or something like that. That's probably going to happen as people are more comfortable. Efrain Rivera : Let me just add one other thing because I think you raise a good point. Those of you who've followed us for a while know that we tend to err on the side of being a bit conservative in terms of what we say and try not to get over our skis too much. But I would say this, if you look through the first three quarters, and Marty mentioned that our net client gain was the highest that certainly it's been in recent memory in the third quarter, if you look through three quarters, we're on a pace to really smash our retention records. Significant improvements that, frankly, nine years ago, I would never have thought was possible. But let's leave that to the side. Right now, as we speak, our rate of revenue retention, ignore client retention, is verging on 90-plus percent. That's a number, given our client base, which is really pretty extraordinary. So, when I looked at those numbers and I say, 'why is that,' it's all of those small actions, seemingly small, in helping clients that have driven them to stay with us. Now, will we end the year there? I would say, we have to see what happens in the fourth quarter. But we're on record-setting levels from the standpoint of both locking down the client base on units and also in terms of revenue retention through the first three quarters of the year. So, we're feeling pretty good. We expect some slippage as we get into the summer. That's to be expected. But we've set ourselves up pretty well. So, if we can continue to derive benefit from all of the actions that are occurring and all of the packages that have been released and continue to serve clients well, we're well positioned for next year. Martin Mucci : Bryan, one other point, just to be very clear on it too on the question that you had, when you think about it, they will need \u2013 they will look for our support to file for forgiveness, loan forgiveness, as well as these \u2013 a lot of the stimulus things move through into our next fiscal year. So, I do think it will have specific retention benefits based on the fact that they'll need support on loan forgiveness that we have automated into the Flex system that makes it easy for them to apply and also for things like the employee retention tax credits, if they have to refile quarterly returns or file them correctly or go back and get data. I think it will certainly help us. There will be a little bit of a tail on some of the stimulus piece of it. Bryan Bergin : Just as a follow-up, I wanted to dig in a little bit more around the demand improvement by client size. So, we heard the continuation of strong performance on the small end. Can you quantify anything around short payroll? And then on your upper end, anything around mid-market that you're seeing different? Martin Mucci : Payroll, the low end, has continued to be strong. Not as strong as it was in the first half. There was a big bounce there for household employers like nanny payrolls, things like that. That demand isn't as strong. But the demand coming in from a digital perspective through marketing and on the website and sales from a digital continue to be strong and consistent and persistent, I would say. On the mid-market side, that's probably been more affected by the no decision. So, we're getting in front. As I mentioned earlier, the key metrics of getting in front of more clients, winning when there is a decision made against competitors is better. I wouldn't say we're as strong as we want it to be in the mid-market, more because of no decision, not because of losing to a competitor. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas of William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : Given the demand dynamics around the ASO and PEO businesses, I'm wondering how we should think about the likelihood of an ASO client eventually opting for the insurance benefit via the PEO offering? What type of upsell frequency have you historically experienced? And then, if you could give any color on what the economics look like when a client transitions from ASO to PEO, that would be helpful. Martin Mucci : I'll start with the demand for it. And remember that we kind of go in and can offer both upfront. And many times, if they're not a good insurance risk or fit the underwriting, the ASO is a stronger platform for them or we can take them through our agency. I think that there's always availability of upsell ASO to PEO later, but it's not always as strong. We make that available to them. We always are ready to offer that to them. And we keep an eye on that through the HR generalist that service them, that if they have benefit and insurance needs where we can supplant their ASO offering with a plan,we can do that. But I would say that we do a pretty good job upfront of identifying, for the client, whether the better value is to go PEO or ASO and offer those options to them.  You want to catch on the economics, Efrain? Efrain Rivera : There's a revenue uplift if you go from PEO to ASO. Just to kind of build on what Marty said. This has been an extraordinary year in terms of the growth in the ASO offering. And I think that what happened, Andrew, this year \u2013 we'll see how this trend plays out \u2013 was that because people were so interested in getting HR support quickly, they opted for what ended up being the solution that gave them that support the quickest. We do think there's an opportunity for ASO to PEO conversion and there's revenue uplift in two areas. One, because the admin fee is higher; and second because, of course, the attachment of insurances would boost revenue. So, we think there's an opportunity there. And I think we'll wait for the dust to settle in the fourth quarter, see where that opportunity is and then see how we go after attacking that. For now, as Marty's been saying over the last three quarters, clients have a desire to get an HR solution in place quickly because of the changing landscape of regulations and our HR specialists have been terrific in guiding clients through that. So, more to come on that. Andrew Nicholas : For my follow-up, I was wondering if you could just speak to how healthcare utilization and claim costs are trending in your risk-based plans? And also, whether your experience over the past 12-plus months has impacted how you're thinking about risk-taking in the PEO business broadly, if at all? Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Short answer is really not much of a significant change. I think that what you're continuing to see, to be fair, I'd like to claim it was all superior management, and I would say to my colleagues in the PEO, of course, it was superior management for them. But the reality is also that there's a market component here where people continue to defer elective surgery \u2013 elective medical procedures, not just surgery. So, costs have been very contained. And I would say that's across a wide range of plans that we have. It doesn't change our perspective on risk on healthcare. I think properly managed, if you underwrite it correctly and you have a strong underwriting group, which we do, I think that our appetite for risk on healthcare remains unchanged. So, I think that that will continue. And as Marty said earlier, the value prop of healthcare, we think that that will start to come back next year as conditions change, the pandemic abates, and people are looking at a little bit more normalized environment. So, that's where those things stand. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America. Mihir Bhatia : First, I just wanted to ask, can we just get the latest update on what you're seeing in different parts of the market, just in terms of pricing, in terms of promotional offers, discounting, things like that? Martin Mucci : I think it's been pretty consistent with what we've seen. I don't think there's been any major changes from that. We still feel like we have pricing power and can do the things that we normally do. We do offer various competitive pricing tactics to win clients over, but I don't think things have changed all that drastically out there. Mihir Bhatia : Just a question on the early view you provided on fiscal 2022. Firstly, I appreciate you providing that view, but maybe you could share just some of the underlying assumptions that are embedded in that guidance? Just things like US unemployment rate, GDP growth, or new business formation, just what you expect from the competitive environment, things like that. Efrain Rivera : I would say that our outlook at this stage embodies a continued gradual recovery into next year. We're not expecting super sharp decrease in unemployment. We are wrestling with that. We're wrestling with the current environment.  Now, I would say that fourth quarter is trending close to what we expected from a macro standpoint, but we're not expecting it to be dramatically different, probably doesn't change \u2013 you don't start to see a significant change until end of year, beginning of next year calendar 2021 into 2022. So, the macro doesn't change significantly. We are benefiting, I would say, especially as other competitors not so much, from a very robust environment in terms of new business formation. So, our new business sales are up significantly. That benefits more the lower end than the mid-market and expect that it will continue positive. From an interest rate standpoint, it looks like we've had a sharp move upwards. We don't expect it to be that significantly different. And so, I think that we're expecting the trends that you start to see in the fourth quarter that we're experiencing already in March, are going to continue, but it will be more gradual. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets. Jeffrey Silber : You talked a lot about what you've been doing for clients with some of the stimulus funds that's been pushed into the economy over the past year. Last week, we had an announcement of an infrastructure plan. I don't know if you're going to be benefiting or your clients are benefiting it from directly, but is there anything in there that you might be able to participate in? Martin Mucci : I think probably more indirectly. I think if you think about a lot of the infrastructure going to construction, we benefit from constructionwhen there is more construction, whether it'sin homebuilding or road construction or other facilities,everything kind of around that \u2013 there's a lot of small business around that, small and mid-sized businesses. And I think, definitely, it provides more jobs and then we'll benefit from that. I don't see it directly, but indirectly, I think, certainly, any boost like that to construction, to everything around it will be a positive for us. Still early to see exactly how that's going to play out and how long it takes to get that money into the economy, but we should be a benefactor of it. Jeffrey Silber : Efrain, I guess, the implied guidance for the fourth quarter is somewhat wide. Can you just give us any framework? What should we expect on the high end and the low end? And also, what share count is embedded in that guidance? Thanks so much. Efrain Rivera : Jeff, I think that shares will move slightly lower than where they are right now, but not a significant change. The service revenue, I thinkI called it out at 7% to 9% for fourth quarter. I would just add a little bit of color to that, which is to say that Management Solutions will grow faster than PEO in the fourth quarter. So, I think that's enough to kind of add the points together to get you to where you need when you couple it with the year guidance. I would say, look, it will be good to talk about growth. We've had pockets of growth in the last three quarters, but it will be good to resume a period of more normalized growth in the fourth quarter. So, that's what we're expecting at this stage. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : I wanted to ask a little bit about payroll, and I think you alluded to this a little bit, Marty, but when COVID was originally occurring last year, one of the issues that you had was not doing price increases or not putting that burden on your customers. Where we stand today, do you think you'll go back to the normal cycle or how do you think that environment looks in terms of the ability to get some price increases? Martin Mucci : I think the ability is there. In fact, Kartik, I think during this year, as a lot of things that we've talked about, we've shown a lot of value to our clients and I think we're probably in as good or better position than we've ever been. One of the opportunities, while it's difficult on us and on our clients, is the ability to show how strong we are as a company and what we add to our clients and help them through a very difficult time. So, I think the pricing power is very consistent and I think you'd see a more of a normalized move in that regard. Kartik Mehta : Just the second question \u2013 Efrain, last question. Any change in thoughts on how you'll manage the float [ph] portfolio? I know you kind of gave guidance for FY 2022, but I'm wondering, considering what's happening with rates, how you might change the management of that? Efrain Rivera : I've got a long meeting to discuss various scenarios. And so, the short answer is we're looking at that. The shape of the yield curve presents opportunities that wouldn't have been there several years ago. So, we're looking at a range of options there to see if we can squeeze a bit more out of the portfolio. I wouldn't expect anything significant, but we're looking at opportunities to optimize it, given the fact that we now have a steeper yield curve and looks like longer-term rates may be heading higher. I don't have a complete answer yet. We'll build that obviously when we get to the fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eugene Simuni of MoffettNathanson. Eugene Simuni : I have two that I'll ask upfront, both related to M&A. So, you closed the Oasis acquisition about two-and-a-half years ago. So, one question is, is the integration of that acquisition fully completed now? I know, obviously, you went through the crisis and maybe there was some pause there. Or is there synergies left that might help the recovery in the PEO of the next 12 months or so?  And then I'll ask the second one right away. Just more broadly, as we're coming out of the crisis, has M&A been a consideration? If so, what kind of assets could be attractive to you guys? Martin Mucci : I think the Oasis integration, yeah, it's gone very well particularly lately. We've been in the PEO business for a long time, so that integration made sense. We made sure at the beginning \u2013 when you think back now, almost two years, we had some bumps in the road from a combination of the sales teams and their compensation policies and all that stuff. But we're past that and I think that we've continued to see good synergies that we expected. Unfortunately, the pandemic obviously put a damper on some of that from a sales perspective as you can see. And so, a little disappointing there. But generally, I think we were on a good \u2013 we were heading on a good path until the pandemic hit now over a year ago. I do think there's always still synergies that we can look for there as we combine kind of our traditional \u2013 our PEO business with Oasis and we continue to do that from a platform perspective and look at the platform, look at the way we're selling, how we sell ASO to both markets and those things. So, I think there are still some things there we can do. But we're very high on the PEO market and the ability of where it's going to come back as we come out of the pandemic. Again, all the things we talked about earlier, a little bit higher indexed than hospitality in some states and some areas of the states that were hit a little bit harder, I do think we have some opportunity to see that bounce back. On M&A, I think we've continued through the pandemic to continue to look at opportunities that we see. So we'll still have the same kind of ideas in mind for that. That can be the PEO business. We're obviously interested in, from a product standpoint, if there's things we need, but we don't see a big need there right now. Always looking at payroll HR and anything else that we can do there. In international, we picked up a small acquisition that we think will add to the product set internationally as well. We did that kind of under the radar, kind of as a small one. But we think that could have some impact too. So, yeah, we're still very interested in M&A. Obviously, we're in a good position from a cash standpoint if that opportunity comes up and we'll continue to watch for good valuations that make sense, particularly coming out of the pandemic. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen of Citi. Peter Christiansen : Marty, I was wondering if you can talk about the decision delay discussion that we've been having here. Has it been a regional issue,given that some of the southern states have opened up where there is a lot of PEO business there? I was just curious if that's been a factor certainly impacting face-to-face meetings, so on and so forth. And as a follow-up, Efrain, I was wondering if can you talk about expectations for go-to-market spending in 2022 and if that is factored in in the margin outlook? Thank you. Martin Mucci : I would say, yeah. I mean, as more businesses open up, they're getting more comfortable with the ability to have a rep come in and talk to them.  I do think as we look back at the year, we transitioned very quickly to virtual selling, all telephonic. Of course, we've been selling telephonic for many years and really maximizing the use of our marketing spend to bring more leads into the website and into telephonic sales. So, I think that really helped us kind of hone our skills very quickly because we'd already been on that path and actually got us there even faster. But I think, yeah, we're really looking forward to where more businesses are comfortable. We've already started to open that back up to say that we're available for face-to-face meetings. We do want the rep and the client have to be comfortable with it. But I think you're going to see that pick up quite quickly as you're seeing the states open up and people just get more comfortable with it from that standpoint, that I think will drive an increase in certainly in close rate.  And then just the comfort level that customers are coming back. Our business, our clients, customers are coming back. I think now they'll be more open to making a decision as to what they need. And I think Paychex has a full suite of products that can help them grow in this as we come out of the pandemic. Efrain Rivera : With respect to go-to-market spending, we, in the face of the pandemic, actually increased our marketing spend. Going into next year, we'll continue to spend against the opportunities that we see. And so, don't anticipate that that's going to get clawed back.  There is an opportunity in California on retirement services. Not a business we talked about a lot, but a business that has done well and which we think there's an opportunity. Marty mentioned PEP, but there's also a mandate in California around providing retirement services. We think that could be a nice opportunity and we're looking at ways to optimize that opportunity going into fiscal year 2022. So, we'll continue to spend at a good clip to be able to address the market needs that we see. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana of Jefferies. Samad Samana : Maybe a follow up to the last question around go-to-market. Efrain, how should we think about maybe the incremental cost to acquire a customer and how that's trended? So, not just the absolute spending, but the CAC for customers, especially with most of you and your competitors having to sell virtually still in this environment, are you seeing the per-unit costs go up or have they stayed relatively consistent? Could you give us some color on that? Efrain Rivera : It depends on the channel, Samad. So, I would say that where those leads are driven through our digital channels, while \u2013 I would say we've spent more, we actually have gotten good economies of scale in our spending. And I would say the marketing group has done a fantastic job of optimizing our marketing spend. So I think, in that sense, that's been good. So I see, as we pivot our field based resources into more digital or virtual, we end up realizing a savings that we then plough back into marketing. And I think that we can make that equation work with some net savings with respect to the other channels. It's about the same. It's not dramatically different from what it was. But as the business pivots more toward digital, and it will continue to do that, I think what you're going to see is an ability to optimize spend and to get better economies of scale in that trade. Samad Samana : Similarly, on the retention side, the number you called out was quite high. Any trends now that we're a year in on the retention of customers acquired more through the digital channels throughout the last year or so versus maybe the historical basin and if there's any dispersion in the retention trends there? Efrain Rivera : Two things. I'll answer a question you didn't ask and I'll answer the question you asked. So first, the question you asked. The short answer to the question is the smaller the client, the more the propensity to churn. So that hasn't changed. So we would expect that we'll see a bit more churn as we get into next year simply because the survival rates on clients that are under four are typically not terrific. But we haven't seen any significant increases in bucket of clients and we're certainly handily outselling losses either through SurePayroll or through our virtual sales. So that's been a positive. And we expect that a lot of those trends will continue into next year.  Will it lockdown to the extent \u2013 and by lockdown, I mean will we have less churn in the way we've experienced this year going into next year? That's to be seen. I would certainly expect in the first half of the year, we're going to see continued positive news on retention. We'll see what happens in the back half of the year when things start to open up. The second thing I'd say is that one of the things that we looked at very closely is, in terms of clients who now have taken our HR solutions, how are they churning or not churning in the base? And the short answer to that is they're not. So they see a lot of value in what we're providing. That's a big revenue for us. And I think that's helping to drive what are really good revenue retention numbers. Then I will update as we get into next year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of J.P. Morgan. Tien- tsin Huang : I'm just trying to think about some of the answers you've given around the client and decisions. And I'm just trying to summarize in my head. Is it more structural or cyclical? It sounds like it's both, but I just want to make sure it's not one more so than the other, if that makes sense. Martin Mucci : I think the no decision \u2013 if I get your question right, Tien-tsin, I think it's just \u2013 honestly, I think it's just focus. I think they're interested in the presentation. So our presentations are up, our end user presentations, and we're feeling very good about that. But what's happening is that the client is deciding, well, I'm just not ready to decide yet. There's just too many things going on. Either they'remaybe getting a loan, they're finding out new ways to get employee retention tax credits. They've got a lot going on. And I thinkwhat you're finding is that it's a no decision, not a \u2013 or I'd say not right now decision, let me put it that way versus a no decision. It's not losing to competitors. As I said, what we're seeing is better competitor win rates when they are making a decision. So, we feel good about from that standpoint. So, I think it's more of a timing of what we're getting \u2013 the feedback we're getting and we're seeing as it's more of a timing thing than anything. So we're hoping for a pickup. It's just that it's a big number in the selling season to produce. Andthat's a tough one when you're not getting as many decisions being made. And it's a little bit more obviously on the mid-market side where they have more complexity to their business that they're working on. Tien- tsin Huang : I know the retention results have been great. And I'm sure you're not standing by from a sales perspective. But given what you've learned on selling so far, do you anticipate changing your traditional versus digital sales investments from a mix perspective going into fiscal 2022 or is it more you're just going to be ready to catch it in the net here as things open up? Martin Mucci : I think it's one of those things that's going to continue to evolve. We were doing that beforehand. Where you're going to see more \u2013 as Efrain said, you're going to see more spend \u2013 the shift in marketing and sales, you're going to see more spend in marketing as we've already seen this year. It's justthe way things \u2013 clients and prospects have gotten more used to saying, hey, I don't know if I have to see somebody in person, right? So, I can sell. I don't want to give you the impression that we \u2013 we're pretty much year-to-date where we thought we would be on sales. Soit's worked, this pivot of going and selling remotely has worked pretty well. So, we're not going to go back to the full model, but we'll certainly go back to more of the selling face-to-face, but we found a lot of new tools and a lot of new training and ways to sell online. Frankly, it's more effective. And you can spend more in marketing, but you're going to spend a little bit less in sales, doing sales kind of thing. I don't think it's not going to go back to where we were. It'll continue to evolveas we need to, to sell the product. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of Baird. Mark Marcon : I'm wondering with regards to the win rates, the improvement that you're seeing, who is that primarily coming against? Do you have any sense? Martin Mucci : You'd know them very well. They're the major competitors in the mid-market space, would be most of them. That'sthe ones that we're seeing. And it's pretty consistent. It's not just one of them. It's beenthe top players in there that you would know very well and cover. Mark Marcon : With regards to your assumptions for next year, how do you thinkit's going to end up trending in terms of the clients being distracted? Initially, they're distracted because of,obviously, COVID and the unprecedented nature. Now, it looks likewe're going to end up havingpotentially a lot of stimulus combined with COVID fading. Are they going to get overwhelmed with business and too busy to think about things? Or do you think if they're really super busythat could actually be a spur to increasing decisions? Martin Mucci : \u2013: Mark Marcon : And with regards to the micro end of the market, are you seeing any impact from a large competitor introducing a micro solution? Martin Mucci : We have not yet. And I thinkit's going to be interesting. We're going to watch it, obviously.It's a very basic product andyou're going to get what you pay for. It's very basic. There's not going to be personal support, I don't believe.As we've said, we've moved a lot to self-service. But at the same time, we're always ready7/24/365 to provide that support. And we've found that to be very critical to our clients during the pandemic, in particular. If they get hung up on something and they need to talk to someone, they don't want to wait for a text back or someone to answer an email when they can't talk to a live person. Just like how many of us find software support these days? So, it's going to be as good until you need something different and then it could be a frustration. So, haven't seen the impact yet, but we'll watch it. Mark Marcon : With regards to two things, just the PEO, under what conditions do you think that really does transition where people will say ASO is great, but PEO is really what would be better. Like how confident are you in terms of seeing that?  And then the second question is just on the service footprint, does as you cut back on the geography \u2013 and it seems like retention is doing extremely well. So, it seems like your client satisfaction must be really doing well. But are you seeing any sort of \u2013 are there any negatives with regards to the \u2013 the cutback with regards to the geographic footprint on the service side? Martin Mucci : I have not seen a lot of it, Mark. It's a tribute to our operations leadership team and how we've handled that. Many of those tenured employees that were in the offices that we closed are working from home. So, the clients have not seen that disruption from losing their payroll specialist that they've had for many years. We've been able to transition to that work-from-home environment which was accelerated by the pandemic. We had already planned on doing some of that over the next few years, but accelerated it. And frankly, my hats off to the technology teams here, the operations, leadership that have really done a very good job in making sure that that continue to be handled. And they've also positioned clients into the right service centers. So, if they were normally calling in, we're transitioning them to different service centers that can handle them from that standpoint. So, I think we've done a really good job and have not seen a fallout on that.  On the PEO question, I think, again, it's going to come back to \u2013 as clients feel a little bit morethings are calmed down, now it's going to be again, how do I recruit, retain, and really make sure I get the employees that I need while there's still some disruption to the employees. I think even through the summer with childcare, with unemployment having an additional higher rate of payment to them, so they're going to be interested in, hey, what are the benefit plans that I can offer them, how am I going to be able to provide those benefit plans, are they good benefit plan? I think the PEO interest will pick back upas we get into the second half of the calendar year. And into our next fiscal year, we expect that that will start to pick back up again. Mark Marcon : Last one for me, just Clover, how has that partnership worked? Have you seen much of an impact or do you expect to see more of an incremental impact over the coming year? Martin Mucci : It's going to have more of an impact coming up. We've finished this integration where the app, the Flex app is on the Clover platform. So, I'm a Clover customer, I fire up my point-of-sale terminal and I've got the marketplace from Fiserv's Clover there. Paychex is right there as a preferred app. And once they realize that if they're a Flex customer from Paychex and a Fiserv point-of-sale Clover customer, they can now have all of that information integrated, the time and attendance will automatically populate from the point-of-sale terminal. I think all of that integration has recently kind of gotten done now. And so, I think that we'll see more of an impact in the next fiscal year as that gets out there more and they start to see the combined benefits of being together, Clover and Flex. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Grossman of Stifel. David Grossman : Just a couple of really quick ones. So, there's a lot of noise in the market right now. I think it's fair to say retention is going to be up for everybody in the industry. Increased complexity definitely plays into the outsourcing theme and you've got really difficult comps this year transitioning, obviously, to more favorable comps next year. We all appreciate the fiscal 2022early look. However, at the risk of sounding greedy,perhaps you could help us sort through how to do more normalized growthwhen you get past these distortions from the reopening and the compares? Martin Mucci : You mean what our expectation is, Dave? David Grossman : Yeah. I don't want to ask you yet too granular, obviously. But just a way to think about what a more normalized growth\u2026 Martin Mucci : What I say when I get asked that question is, pre-pandemic, Management Solutions growing about 6%. We certainly expect Management Solutions will grow in mid-single digits, maybe here faster. We'd want it to grow faster than that. And then, we expect PEO to grow double-digit or around there. Insurance, it's a little bit of a drag at this point. Unfortunately, the workers' comp market has not recovered. But that's what we expect. And frankly, in some ways, if you look at the guidance next year, that's sort of what you're seeing, right?  Could we do better? Sure. There is a possibility, as we get through Q4, that we come out of it even stronger than we expected. But I think as a reasonable starting point, that's where we're at right now, yeah. David Grossman : On the PEO, obviously, you're underperforming with peers right now and you gave us some of those reasons. How impactful are the insurance and the SUI versus the over-indexing to hospitality? Can you help us think through the relative impact? Martin Mucci : I think it's a mix of that and I think the insurances haven't helped. You put your finger on it. SUI is going to be an impact into Q4. And that's going to be an impact. Workers' comp has an impact too. So, I think you've got a mix, a m\u00e9lange of, say, of different issues there. But I think we start to anniversary those as we get into next year. David Grossman : You mentioned one other interesting thing about self-service characteristics of the platform. And I think you mentioned it in the context of your costs going down. I guess my question is really more competitively since that's one of the biggest criticismsthroughout the spectrum of client size ofkind of your model versus a software model. So,am I reading too much into that or is there more to come here and where may we be on that journey or that transformation ofembedding more self-service characteristics to give the client more control and just give them the services when they need it? Martin Mucci : It's been very important to us. It's actually something \u2013 that innovation, we've been on a path for that for some time. And it's really an ability of getting the client and the client's employees to see how easy it is to do those things. I think the pandemic has helped in the fact that while employees were away from many worksites,it forced the clients to say, hey, you can do this yourself or I can do it for you. But we're not together, so we can't be passing paper round and there's no longer a need for that. So, as I mentioned,over 80% of changes like direct deposit changes, address changes, things like that are done by the clients or their employees now and we see that continuing.  The movement will continue to be self-service even in sales itself and setting up, the client allowing themselves to be set up. Much of that is done with SurePayroll now and that'll continue on the Flex platform. Hey, are you there? We're always going to be available to them if they need us. But definitely, there is not only us cost-saving, but even probably more important, there's a value to the client that want to do it themselves when they want to do it. And we've been on that track for some time. We just probably haven't talked about it as much from that standpoint. But I think we're well on that continuum and that will continue as an offering to clients. But always leaving that, hey, if you want \u2013 if you have an issue, you can get to us any time to be able to get you through it if you need it. Efrain Rivera : The other thing I'd say, David, is we're proudly a tech services firm. You cannot win the awards that we won. Those aren't paid awards. We didn't pay anyone to give us those awards unless independent third parties look at your platform and your service and say, yeah, you know what, they do what they're going to do and clients agree with that. Look at those awards. I would just say to people, look at that. The prevalence of the model, the strength of the model is shown by our retention numbers and the service we were able to deliver to clients.  I would say this, of course, there's an opportunity for pure-software players in the market. But if everyone drops out and provides no service, that's great for us because, you know what, we'll be there to catch those clients because a lot of clients, especially in the SME market, need some element of service. So, we're not going to run away from that. How we deliver it? That can change. And frankly, over the last \u2013 since tax reform, many of you know, we made significant investments to accelerate the opportunity. You want a low-end solution where you don't talk to anyone and you can onboard yourself? By the way, let's talk about reality. Ask our competitors who can do that. We can. Ask them if they can do it end to end. I think you're going to get some funny stares on that. My point is, we don't cede our tech chops to anyone. We're as good as anyone else. But what we do is we also give you value-added service. And this year was a year where you saw the benefit of that. And what we're seeing, the reason we're seeing our retention numbers and revenue retention numbers at the levels they are is because we did it with excellence. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : I wanted to follow up just on that last comment. Obviously, you guys have been very successful in adding capabilities. Not just evidenced by the awards, but also by other capabilities and new products, et cetera. How are you feeling now about kind of the pace of innovation in the industry? And what are you feeling in terms of what Paychex needs to do to match that or exceed that both from an R&D perspective? It seems like you're pretty comfortable from that perspective. But is there some supplementation you're looking at from an M&A where it makes sense to go out and acquire capabilities or technologies? Or do you feel like most of what you're seeing and what you need to do can be handled through internal development? Martin Mucci : I think most of it can be done by internal development. Just following up on Efrain's passionate speech there, I think we under \u2013 probably undersold the technology side of us over the years because we're so proud of the service side as well. And when you think about things like the loans, when that stimulus \u2013 when the CARES Act first came out, the next day, we introduced a product that said all of your information is pre-populated in Flex. If you're a client of ours, all of your payroll information is in there, you can apply for the loan. And then we shortly said, you can now send your information to Biz2Credit and it will automatically apply. All you have to add is a few things and we have signature-ready forms for you to apply for forgiveness as well. So, I'm very proud of the fact of what our IT and the technology team have done. I think we've added those things over the years that we needed. Time and attendance, we bought as a very small add-on product and have now turned it into a very large business, growing extremely strong now as part of a revenue stream for us. And we've integrated that into the SaaS cloud-based Flex product. The mobile app, as I mentioned a few times, still a five-star app that is getting increased usage and has a lot of ways to go. So, I'm very comfortable. Now, we're always looking \u2013 probably from an M&A standpoint also \u2013 or even partnership standpoint like the Clover example. We have the technology, but when you integrate that now with a point-of-sale platform that's best in the business, now you really have some additional power that you're putting the technology. So, I've got a point-of-sale, but boy, now I've got a great time and attendance solution and a payroll solution that's all integrated with seamless connection, that's really powerful. So, it's probably more partnership than it is even M&A. But we're always interested in that, but we've built out most of our technology and we're very proud of it. James Faucette : My last question here is just you've talked about, over the course of the last year, some variances from geographies in terms of pace of recovery, et cetera. Does that continue to be the case? And what key things are you watching for to measure and try to forecast that recovery, particularly in maybe some of the regions if there are differences that are a little bit behind? Martin Mucci : Well, our own small business index that Paychex puts out with \u2013 i.e. just market every month, we've seen this last month, we saw the best one-month gain in jobs in about eight years, and it was across all regions. So, that's very positive. The South has been the strongest as you'd expect. They're lower wages, but they've had more growth. Just exodus to the South and just more construction, commercial and residential. But right now, in March anyway, we saw growth in every region, and I think 18 out of the 20 states that we look at for the best growth. So, we're seeing pretty \u2013 growth across that we use our own metrics that way. We're seeing that and we're seeing a bounce back in employees a little bit. But it's going to be interesting through the summer. I think you're really going to see the bounce in September as people start saying, okay, schools are back in, people are coming back full time into work. There may be still flexible work conditions, but that's when I thinkas you see the summer and I guess be ready for all of that, our clients are going to start picking up on the decision making. That's all the questions, right, operator? Operator : That's correct sir. Martin Mucci : All right. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for about 90 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our third quarter press release conference call and your interest in Paychex. We greatly appreciate it. I hope you all continue to remain safe and healthy. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]  I will now turn the call over to Mr. Martin Mucci, President and CEO. Please go ahead. Martin Mucci : Thank you. And thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. And this morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended March 31, 2021. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start today's call with an update on the business highlights for the fourth quarter, Efrain will review our financial results for both the fourth quarter and the full year and discuss our guidance for the upcoming fiscal 2022, and then we will open it up for your questions. Before I comment on our results, I just want to take a moment to note that Paychex is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. We are proud of our 50 years of innovation in support of small- and medium-sized businesses from the payroll services provided to our first client in 1971 to the critical care we gave our clients through the unprecedented pandemic environment over the last 15 months. We are excited to continue to build on this legacy of technology-enabled service that keeps it simple for our clients and gives them the freedom to succeed in their businesses. Fiscal 2021 presented one of the most challenging periods in our history. Yet our commitment to servicing our clients with innovative products made it a very successful year. We finished the year reporting positive growth of 1% for both service revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the midst of a pandemic with almost 15,000 employees working remotely.  The results of the past year are a testament to our resilient business model and the hard work and dedication of all of our employees who made sure that our clients were well informed and had the technology, products, and resources needed during this challenging time, many times for the actual survival of our clients\u2019 businesses. We achieved record fourth quarter revenue and earnings and we began to see positive \u2013 as we began to see positive macroeconomic impacts from the economic stimulus and an increase in vaccinations that have allowed businesses to reopen and begin adding employees. This was evident in our check volume trends, our increase in time and attendance activity, and strong sequential growth in both PEO and ASO worksite employees. We ended the year with 4% growth in our payroll client base, the highest organic growth rate we have seen in a number of years. This was driven by both solid sales performance and a record level of client retention of approximately 85% of our beginning client base. We also grew total worksite employees 18% to 1.7 million. We achieved growth in total sales revenue for the year, quite an accomplishment given the impact of the pandemic on the business environment and with all of our sales teams selling virtually. Throughout fiscal 2021, we have seen strength in our virtual sales, retirement services, and HR solutions, all of which experienced double-digit growth for the year. This growth was fueled by a record high fourth quarter in new sales revenue. These positive results coupled with signs of continuing momentum in sales lead generation and nurturing campaigns leaves us well-positioned for a strong sales year in fiscal 2022. Our unique combination of innovative products and service are designed to meet the evolving needs of employers and their employees. The strength of our technology backed by our HR and compliance expertise, and personalized service continues to be recognized by industry experts. The Sapient Insights Group Annual HR Survey ranked Paychex Flex #1 among all solution providers is rated by their voice of the customer report in both user experience and client satisfaction scores. In addition, Lighthouse Research and Advisory announced Paychex Flex won its second annual HR Tech Award for the best small and medium business-focused solution in the Core HR/Workforce category. We were recognized for the strength of our technology and service in providing support to our clients during the pandemic. In particular, our ongoing federal stimulus support, HR services team, and digital communications solutions have proven valuable during this challenging time. Looking ahead, there'll be continued challenges for employers as Americans continue to get vaccinated, state restrictions relax, and businesses fully reopen. The war for talent has intensified, and we are well-positioned with our fully integrated Flex recruiting, an applicant tracking module, and our partnership and integration with Indeed, the world's largest job board to help businesses find, hire, engage, and retain employees quickly and easily.  Recently, we released additional self service capabilities, which accelerate the speed to hire and lessen the administrative burden on businesses. This tool simplifies the experience and includes the ability to invite the new hire to onboard and complete documentation digitally. We are in the early days but reception of this tool has been very positive. Since its release, 80% of the transactions in this new solution have been completed using a mobile device, reflecting on the strength of our mobile and self service capabilities. Retaining talent in today's environment requires a comprehensive benefits package. The latest innovation in our retirement services offering, our pooled employer plan has quickly surpassed 4,000 clients since our January release just a few months ago with strong activity in the pipeline. Managing cash flow and labor expenses continues to be important as the economy ramps up. The new Paychex Flex labor cost hub gives clients a holistic, real time view of total job costing and labor distribution expenses to drive greater insights to manage their workforce. This is an addition to our suite of data analytics capabilities that provide our clients with advanced features typically reserved for larger companies, and we continue to update our Paychex Protection Programs solutions in near real time and allow clients to easily navigate the complexities of the PPP and Employee Retention Tax Credit concurrently. By quickly developing and deploying these updates in Paychex Flex, we have helped our clients secure over $65 billion in payroll protection loans and $2.5 billion in employee retention and paid sick leave credits combined. I\u2019d also like to provide updates on a few other areas where we continue to invest. Near the end of fiscal 2020, we launched our real-time payment solution, in sense then it processed over 50,000 payrolls funding over $200 million to client employees. This provides clients the ability to process their payroll on check date and fund direct deposit transactions within 15 seconds, a true cash management opportunity for businesses of all sizes. Our Paychex Flex intelligence engine, our AI and machine-learning chatbot is now trained to successfully answer over 340 questions, while also providing users access to our help center inventory of 800 instructional and educational materials. This past fiscal year, our automated help solutions have serviced approximately 1.8 million client and employee users, handling over 60% of the questions in an automated fashion. And we have seen double-digit increases in the number of sessions on our five star Paychex Flex mobile app, and the use of our self-service functionality continues to grow. Just two weeks ago, we hosted thousands of clients at our first ever exclusive Virtual Paychex Business Conference, we brought together experts, insights, resources and solutions that clients need to build a better workplace, increased productivity, [and drive] in 2021 and beyond. It was an important way to thank our clients for their tremendous loyalty as reflected in our historic levels of client retention. The post-pandemic future of work is still evolving. We remain focused on helping our clients adapt near term, this includes PPP forgiveness, employee retention tax credits, rebuilding workforces and managing the return to work environment. While we are very proud of the performance during fiscal 2021, we are even more excited about how well-positioned we are for growth in fiscal 2022. The combination of our sales momentum, client base growth and satisfaction, industry-leading operating margin and increased investment in our marketing lead generation and product development has us well-positioned for another year of strong financial performance in fiscal 2022. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year, as well as our guidance in fiscal 2022. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Marty. Thanks to everyone who\u2019s on the call. I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and therefore involve risks. Please refer to our earnings release that has all of the disclosure on these issues. In addition, I\u2019ll periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Please, again refer to our press release for more information on these measures. Let me start by providing some of the key points for the quarter, I\u2019ll then follow with greater detail in certain areas, and I\u2019ll discuss our full-year fiscal 2021 results. For the fourth quarter, it was strong, what can you say, total revenue increased 12% to 1 billion and service revenue increased 14% to 1 billion. As we benefited from improved employment levels and higher client counts across all of our solutions, growth rates were bolstered by an easier compared to the prior year fourth quarter that was significantly impacted by the pandemic and remember last year we had a fairly strong quarter in terms of interest on funds held for clients. We\u2019re battling that headwind and delivered the results that you see. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue increased 14% to 756 million and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 13% to 258 million. Interest on funds held, as I just mentioned, decreased 43% as lower average interest rates and realized gains were partially offset by higher average investment balances. Expenses increased 10% to 675 million. The growth in expenses was driven by higher performance based comp, which compared to a prior year quarter reflected a sharp decline due to the pandemic and higher PEO direct insurance costs. Operating income increased 18% to 354 million with an operating margin of 34.4%, a 160 basis point improvement from the prior year fourth quarter. Our effective income tax rate was 24% for the fourth quarter, compared to 24.3% for the same period last year. Both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to stock-based comp payments that occur with the exercise of stock option awards and we do call those out. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 18% for the fourth quarter to $261 million and $0.72 per share, respectively. Let me touch quickly on full-year results. Service revenue as Marty had indicated increased 1% to 4 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 2%. MPO and Insurance Solutions revenue declined 2%. Interest on funds declined 32% to 59 million due to lower average interest rates and realized gains and total revenue was flat year-over-year at 4.1 billion.  Operating income was flat year-over-year at 1.5 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 2% to 1.5 billion with a margin of 36.8%, an expansion of 70 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin excludes one-time costs of 32 million related to the acceleration of cost savings initiatives, including the long-term strategy to reduce our geographic footprint and headcount optimization, the majority of which was recognized during the first quarter, I should say as you know. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 1% to $3.04. Turning to our investment portfolio. Our primary goal as you know is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. The long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.9% and an average duration of 3.3 years, our combined portfolios have earned an average rate return of 1.1% and 1.2% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year respectively, down from the 1.5% and 1.8% for the same periods last year. Financial position, I\u2019ll walk you through our \u2013 the highlights of our financial position and obviously remains pretty strong. It\u2019s a very strong since we have over 1.1 billion with total borrowings of 805 million as of May 31, 2021. Funds held for clients were 3.8 billion, an increase from 3.4 billion as in May 31, 2020, as you know, they vary widely on a day-to-day basis and they average 4.2 billion for the fourth quarter and 3.9 billion for the fiscal year. Our total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of 79 million as of May 31, 2021 compared with 100 million as of May 31, 2020. This decrease in net gain position resulted from increases in longer term yields during the year. Stockholders\u2019 equity was 2.9 billion as of May 31, 2021 and reflected 909 million in dividends paid and 156 million of shares repurchased. Our return for equity for the past 12 months was 38%. Cash flows from operations were 1.3 billion for the fiscal year that actually was a decrease from the same period last year. The decrease though was driven by fluctuations in working capital, including an increase in purchased accounts receivable due to the continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, we just simply didn\u2019t purchase a lot of receivables last year in the same quarter, and it also was influenced by the growth in the business, offset by an increase in worksite employees and payroll related liability. Now let me turn to guidance for the upcoming fiscal year ending May 31, 2022. The outlook reflects the current macroeconomic environment, which continue to show gradual recovery. Our outlook will be as follows. Let me just make this comment before I do that, one of the things that we\u2019re really proud of is if you go back to what we said in April of last year, before we knew everything that we know now, we\u2019ve got some things wrong, but we got a lot of things right, and we also were very, very transparent with the investment community around what we expected to happen. I think if you look at what happened in the year, we were a lot more wrong then \u2013 lot more right than wrong. There were things that we couldn\u2019t [have pegged] which was the speed of the recovery or the sharpness of it. We got the direction. We got the shape of it correctly. We knew the year hinged on the fourth quarter being better. We looked at the macroeconomic data and thought that what happened in fourth quarter would happen. It was stronger than we expected, but the point I want to make is simply that we communicated along all of those steps and we did it in very transparent fashion. We didn\u2019t say, we didn\u2019t know, we told you what we knew, we told you what we didn\u2019t know. And this is where we ended. So, with that, in the spirit of those comments, here\u2019s where we\u2019re landing for 2022. Management Solutions revenue is now expected to grow approximately 7%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 8% to 10%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be even with this year. Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 7%. Adjusted operating income margin is expected to be approximately 38%, an increase of approximately 120 basis points. Let me pause on that. If you look at what happened \u2013 just happened, I would say we are among the few companies that not only grew margins in the middle of a pandemic, but then raised in the following year. And that\u2019s a result of a lot of hard work here, not only in IT, but also in services and across the entire organization. A lot of the initiatives that we took are paying dividend going into next year and we have more than we can do. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the full-year fiscal 2021 is expected to be again approximately 42%. Other expense net is expected to be in the range of 33 million to 37 million. The effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 10% to 12%. We will have some benefit from stock comp exercises. We don\u2019t know what that is so we don\u2019t [bake it] into the guidance. Given the shape of the recovery during fiscal 2021, we expect fiscal 2022 to have stronger growth in the first half of the year and then moderate in the second half. The first half of the year is anticipated to have total revenue growth in the high single-digits and an adjusted operating margin in the range of 37% to 38%. To give you some more color on expectations for the first quarter, we anticipate strong year-over-year growth as the fiscal 2021 first quarter was significantly impacted by the pandemic. We currently anticipate total revenue growth will be in the low-double-digits. I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably in the 11% to 13% range, but certainly low double-digits. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 38%. Of course, all of this is subject to our current assumptions, which are subject to change and we\u2019ll update you again on the first quarter call. And then just final comment, as we wrap up the prepared remarks, I just say this that, when the pandemic started, I feel that a lot of calls from investors and analysts about how we would fare in the pandemic? I think this quarter shows how we fared in the pandemic. We are a very, very resilient business and even during a downturn that no one expected, we did some things that were pretty extraordinary. We take pride in that. That was the work of every single employee in Paychex from sales, to ops, to IT, etcetera, and you know what as Marty said, we think the best is yet to come. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Marty. Martin Mucci : Great, thank you Efrain. Operator, we\u2019ll now open it up for questions, comments. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Efrain Rivera : Did you change your name David? David Togut : What\u2019s that? Efrain Rivera : Did you change your name? She announced it as David Togut. So, I just want to make sure we get it right. David Togut : Yeah, same person, thanks. In your fiscal 2022 guidance for 7% management solutions revenue growth, what are you forecasting for client retention and payroll client base growth? Efrain Rivera : Yeah. So, with respect to payroll client-based growth, David, we expect it to be in the normal range of 1% to 3%. Hopefully, we do better than that. We certainly did better than that this year. Because retention was so strong this year, we expect that it will not reach the level that Marty mentioned. So, we ended the year at 85%. If you look at Flex revenue retention, we were almost 90%. Those are really extraordinary numbers. We expect some loosening of those numbers, but not significant, but we expect it to be down a little bit. David Togut : Understood. Just as a follow up, accounts receivable growth remains elevated at 51% versus the May 2020 balance sheet, can you dig into the purchase accounts receivable detail that you signaled in your comments, and is there a collectability issue here? Efrain Rivera : No non-zero. Hey, David, I mean, I think many people on the call would know that one of our businesses, one of our businesses is funding staffing firms. We don't do staffing, but we fund staffing. So, with an anomaly in the fourth quarter of last year, staffing was down 20%. Those of you who cover staffing firms know that when staffing declines at that level, then there's simply nothing to fund. There's no receivables to fund, and so if you look at last year, our cash flow was 1.44 billion. That was much higher than even I expected, but that's because we didn't put out any money to fund staffing.  This year, we had a really sharp rebound in the back half of the year and in the fourth quarter, and that was a very, very good performer for us, but that means that we purchased more receivables. We get obviously some benefit from doing that. The way it\u2019s reflected in the statement of cash flows is that that shows a growth in receivables. So, I would say those numbers are now more normalized versus a year last year that was artificially depressed. David Togut : So, in the August quarter, should we expect receivable growth to track revenue growth? Efrain Rivera : It still will probably not track it completely because the recovery on staffing really is more of a second half \u2013 a second half phenomenon this year. Staffing was still weak into the first quarter of last year. David Togut : Understood. Thank you very much. Efrain Rivera : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, gentlemen, thanks for taking my question today. I wanted to ask about the fiscal 2022 margin guidance which came in really nicely above our model F and I know you mentioned that it was due to some initiatives that you guys had laid in, and it was kind of a group effort, but could you give us a little more color on what those initiatives might be? What are the primary drivers of that outperformance? Martin Mucci : Yeah, so, I\u2019d say the first thing Ramsey is that when we took the charge last year, we knew that it would produce, we believed in model that it would produce a certain return and it produced that return in probably a little bit more. So, kudos to the team that did that. I think that we continue to evaluate what the right footprint is. There\u2019s no additional charges contemplated, but as we examine that footprint, we're looking for ways to become more efficient. That's number one. Number two, one of the things that a pandemic produces is it produces a keen focus on every single line of expense in the P&L, and I would say that for a company like ours that is built on the idea that we have to operate very efficiently, we looked at and said not every single dollar of cost that was in the model pre-pandemic needs to be in the in the model post-pandemic. And so, we thought we could comfortably manage with a slightly different level of expenses. And so, the expense growth did not match the revenue growth. So, the third thing is a sharp rebound in revenue then produces the ability to leverage further than you would if those costs came in or you didn't have that level of revenue growth. I would say this, I get the question many, many times what's the theoretical max for how our margins can grow? The short answer is that we don't have an answer on that. But obviously, there is a theoretical max, but the point is that that increasingly we look for more and more operating efficiencies as our systems get better and better, and they have gotten better and better. And our operating model has gotten more and more efficient. So, it's really a combination of all of those, it's sustainable, and all of those things are influencing that number. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. That\u2019s terrific and interesting. Also, I wanted to follow up on David's prior question on revenue retention. It's been impressive this year, obviously impressive in the quarter. And I think you also mentioned there's a bunch of drivers there, you know, whether it's product service levels, [indiscernible], etcetera, but can you also call out a couple of things there that really made the difference, and then maybe also just tack on there, as the PPP, you're servicing in terms of the PPP loans made a difference there, are your clients sort of locked in a little more now because they have to unwind all that process? Is that big enough to move the needle in your business? Martin Mucci : I think, Ramsey I think it has definitely helped. I think, you know, clients learned that there was a great value, more value than they maybe have thought in having us and the expertise that we have with compliance and so forth. The ability to be able to provide them access to those PPP loans, the day they were available and giving them a pre-populated kind of an application that they can file for the loan, a pre-populated application that was signature ready for the forgiveness, the ability that we, you know, linked with three fintech providers to help them facilitate loans, and when they couldn't get some \u2013 the interest from the banks, you know, was really very helpful, and I think that has contributed a lot. You know, they're at a stage now where they're still finding that with the employee retention tax credit, we're doing a tremendous service to them by helping them understand that there even is an employee-retention tax credit, and how big that can be to support them from a cash flow perspective. So, I think all of those things in addition to the strength of the product and the service already has really contributed to people saying, hey, I'm not going to leave to save 10% or a free month of service when I see the benefits that the Paychex and the team have provided me. Efrain Rivera : The other thing that I\u2019d \u2013 just to build on that, just, you know, kind of add some numbers to that. Marty mentioned earlier in his comments, look, doing things on a one-year or half-year basis is one thing, doing it on a sustainable basis is another thing. I would say one other thing that we're very, very proud of is that through the pandemic, when there was an unprecedented level of demand on our service providers, we met that need and our net promoter scores hit their highest levels ever in the company. So when you look at all of those things that really plays into the retention number, of course, the economy has something to do with it. But I think the combination of that leads us to believe that this is a sustainable trend going forward. Ramsey El-Assal: Great, thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions here. I wanted to ask the follow-up just in terms of some underlying assumptions in that FY 2022 guide, specifically on pricing, as well as checks per client, and sort of as part of that, what are you kind of assuming in your base case for where the U.S. unemployment rate goes, you know, during the course of your fiscal year? Efrain Rivera : Yeah. So pricing, I think we assume that we returned to a more normal pricing environment Jason. We delayed price increases at the beginning of last year. We thought that was the right thing to do. It impacted us and, but we thought it was the right thing to do for clients. But we resumed a more normal cadence of pricing increases, maybe a little bit, just slightly off from what we would do in a typical year, but pretty close. I think that the way we have pegged our plans is that again we expect in the second half of the year a return to more normal unemployment rates. The first half will still continue to be impacted by what we see, which many of you know, is difficulty in hiring, SMBs struggling to fill positions. I would say that this forecast that we have does not assume even that we're at the same level of checks per payroll or pays per control that we were pre-pandemic through all of next year. If we get to that point that that would be upside to this model, but that's not what we're expecting. We obviously believe it will improve, although I would say, if you looked at the underlying data that forms a plan, it's pretty modest improvement at this point. So, those are some of the key assumptions underlying the forecast or the plan. Jason Kupferberg : That's helpful. I know, you've also been talking the past couple of quarters about a healthier backdrop for new business creation, wanted to get the latest there has that continued in recent months, any type of quantification you might be able to provide, for example, the percent of your new wins coming from newly formed businesses or your win rates and competing for these new businesses? Martin Mucci : Yeah, we're still seeing new business formation, as you would see from the economic numbers are still up very strong. I think they're up 70% year-to-date, over last year, brand new business startups. And I think that we've done a very good job of capturing those through the products that we have both Flex, and SurePayroll, you know, SurePayroll I had a very \u2013 has had a very strong year, and is well, and especially at the beginning of the year, where they picked up a lot of, you know, work at home kind of nanny payrolls and things like that.  Flex also picked up a lot of new startup businesses of various sizes. And I think that, you know, we expect that to continue. I think a lot of it has been the self service, the way we \u2013 the marketing we've done to get the web leads, and then be able to respond to them very quickly, even virtually, and from home and from our virtual sales forces. And then amount of self service that clients can do that they're looking for to now in a brand new business. So, it is definitely continued. We expect it to continue. And I think we performed very well from a closed rate perspective. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Well, thanks for the comments. I appreciate it. Efrain Rivera : All right, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Bryan Bergin : Hey, guys, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask on the record new sales in the quarter. Can you just talk about where you saw that as it relates to client size? Any areas in the market you saw more strength? I just heard the comment you made on the smaller-end, but just more broadly on client size and demand there? And then what solutions are you seeing the strongest demand in? Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think from a size perspective, it was definitely a lot of the new business, you know, start-ups. So, it was on the smaller size. The mid-market did okay, but it was more, it was a little bit more difficult there were the decisions where they were making no decisions kind of thing or delaying decisions. We're starting to see that pick up now as we transition into the new fiscal year. I think, as they're seeing more need for some of the products and services as they try to hire back and build their teams back up. And so we're definitely, I think, [sought their] retirement in HR was very strong, you know retirement was very weak in the first quarter as you'd expect going through the beginning of the pandemic, people weren't talking about retirement.  We shifted some of those resources toward HR outsourcing. They did a great job. Then as we saw more interest in retirement, they shifted back. We introduced the pooled employer plan in January. As I mentioned, that took off. And there's been a very strong need for the pooled employer plan that has really helped support retirement. Our retirement ASO in particular HR outsourcing under the ASO model, PEO has been good. It hasn't been as strong as the insurance needs and changes. I think we'll come along now as people are looking for comprehensive benefit packages to retain and attract employees, but HR, outsourcing retirement. Certainly SurePayroll, you know all were very, you know, very strong. Bryan Bergin : Okay. And then just PEO versus insurance performance, can you kind of break down how each of those businesses performed in 4Q and then how you're building those into your fiscal 2022 outlook? Martin Mucci : Yeah. The growth performance in the quarter was pretty comparable, Ryan, in fourth quarter. At this stage, we think that going into next year that the PEO is going to grow a little bit faster than insurance. I think that, you know, I'd love to say, finally, after about four years that workers comp drag is behind us. It's probably behind us as a drag, but it's not behind us in terms of growth that isn't really strong. I would say one thing that was quite interesting about the quarter was that health and benefits, which we still do a fair amount of sales in the under 50 space had a strong quarter. So there's interesting pockets of demand in the economy above and below 50. And there seems to be a pretty strong demand still for insurance, health and benefits insurance for \u2013 in the under 50 space, in addition, obviously PEO, This is, now I'm talking more standalone, health and benefits. So, in summary, going to next year, we think PEO is going to grow a bit faster than the insurance part. Efrain Rivera : I think Bryan the only one I left out was time and attendance. You know, we've had tremendous consistent growth in time and attendance. And I think, you know, the ability for the technology that we've continued to innovate there from regular time clocks, to retina scan time clocks, to punching in on your mobile phone or your watch has really driven a lot of \u2013 support their time and attendances is got a lot of demand that continues to grow at a double-digit space penetration into our base and new clients. I think a lot of it being that there's going to be a lot more part time employees, you've got flexible work schedules, time and attendance is really critical. So, we're seeing a lot of strength there as well. Bryan Bergin : Okay, understood. Thank you for all the color. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Hi, guys, good morning. Wanted to ask about digital sales, do you think the markets changed more permanently now? And the go to market strategy changes for everybody? Now that people realize some of the efficiencies there, I\u2019m just thinking about the cost structure for you guys, as a result of that? Efrain Rivera : Yeah, I think it has. I mean, I just think it's one of those things that people have gotten, you know, clients, prospects have gotten more used to. We were already in, you know, virtual sales and in lead generation and nurturing programs over the \u2013 particularly over the last few years. And that has continued to grow for us, as well as Flex and SurePayroll. And there's a lot more self service now capabilities that we've introduced as well.  So, not only can you research demo and you know and decide to buy the product, you can do a lot more of itself service, not only through buying the product, depending on your size, but then a salesperson can jump in and help you anywhere along the way. And people want to do things more themselves. Then, you know, as I think I've mentioned in my earlier comments that we're introducing more self service to where the once you onboard a new employee, they can do their own self service setup and everything.  And this is helping a lot of clients, they're used to doing things online, they're used to doing it on a mobile phone. And of course, we've been developing all of our products, mobile first design, so that it's built for the mobile phone, you know, years ago, and that has continued to pay off. A lot of the investments we made in self service and in technology over the last few years, really paid off during the pandemic from a standpoint of clients being able to go online and buy and self serve and set up. And our self service has picked up dramatically.  You know, for existing clients, for example, an employee, you know, due to changing their own direct deposit bank account, changing their address, over 80% of those last year were done by the client or the employee now self service, most of them on our mobile app. So, things have changed, you know, and they sped up during the pandemic. And I think they'll continue to do that. Martin Mucci : Yeah Bryan, the other thing I'd add is, you know our marketing group has really done a great job in terms of identifying sources of leads and optimizing our models so that our dollars are really efficiently spent, spent on the web. But the point you make is a very good one. I think that we've evolved into a world where there is much more digital sales, digital capability, and when you're in front of the client, it frequently is going to be in a hybrid model. It was interesting to hear some of our top salespeople, basically, some of the really high dollar producers, talk about how they were able to pivot in a hybrid fashion to sell when they hadn't done it before. And I think that it's the wave of the future. The positive on that, I would say is that obviously we can get more efficient in terms of our dollar spent. But there's an offset to that, because you have to spend more on digital marketing, there's no way to avoid it. One of the things that we're very, very proud of this year is if you look at us, look at what we did, from the beginning of the pandemic, we did our first TV advertising, we increased our marketing spend. We didn't decrease it this year. So, but that's going to be a more of a permanent feature of the way the business operates. Bryan Keane : Got it. That's really helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up Efrain, when I think about the cadence of service revenue, you talked about the high watermark being in the first quarter. Just trying to think about the model, so the second and third quarter looked more equal and then the tougher comp in Q4 that will be probably the lowest growth rate? I just want to make sure we get the models right. Efrain Rivera : I would say directionally you\u2019re correct. Now, just \u2013 I just want to caution one thing, which is 2022 will be another year where at every quarter we\u2019ll call out what we\u2019re seeing. I mentioned earlier and it\u2019s not a throw-away statement and I think, Jason asked earlier, what are your assumptions about unemployment that\u2019s going to play into what happens. So, we still have \u2013 we still from a pays per control perspective are down from where we were pre-pandemic and we\u2019re not expecting a complete recovery of the question as how quickly that occurs as we go through the year \u2013 that will be something we need to see, but I\u2019d say directionally you\u2019re correct. Bryan Keane : Great, thanks for taking the questions. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson. Efrain Rivera : Hi Eugene. Eugene Simuni : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So, first I wanted to come back for a second to PEO outlook here and on that quickly. So, great bounce back this quarter at 13% growth. It would sound like going forward there is significant tailwinds continuing from T&E recovery, which I know PEO is very exposed to general secular demand, which you can highlight for the outsource products and your - [frankly general] strengthened PEO we think, your outlook is for 8% to 10% growth, so a bit of a deceleration from 13%. Can you maybe talk us through some of the puts and takes that went into that outlook and kind of what makes you perhaps a bit conservative? Efrain Rivera : That\u2019s a good question, Eugene. I am chuckling a little bit. Yes, you look, anyone who goes to a restaurant these days or goes to any hospitality provider knows that the challenges that the industry still faces in terms of completely reopening. We just don\u2019t see that starting to charge ahead until sometime in the fall. So, that would be, of course the compare will be easier as we start the year, but there is still a lot of work to be done in hospitality in accommodations and in the State of Florida where we \u2013 a lot of our businesses, we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re playing that a little bit more cautiously in terms of that part of the business. So to the extent that that turns very quickly and they can find the workers maybe we get more positive we got through the year, but at this point, we think that\u2019s what makes sense. Eugene Simuni : Got it, understood. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, very interested in the opportunity you guys have in growing revenues through getting greater share of wallet with existing customers. You guys highlighted it quite a bit with time and attendance, retirement, other product. So, can you just elaborate on that a little bit more? What are the other, maybe in addition to these two, what are the other areas, services, products where you seeing a lot of opportunity perhaps over the medium-term next couple of years where you can just grab a larger share of the HR budget, which we think there is a [big white space] there? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think the biggest one that is of course the HR Outsourcing. That\u2019s had double-digit growth from the ASO model. I think clients realized in a year, particularly with the pandemic that they had so many questions on how to handle remote workforces, how do you handle vaccine policy, how do you handle \u2013 how you\u2019re going to flexible work schedules? Things that they\u2019ve never addressed before, we saw a great demand for HR at all sizes of clients and how to handle federal and state regulations? So, I think we opened up a whole number of clients who hadn\u2019t thought that they needed it maybe to realize that there is a lot of ongoing support that they could gain from HR services. Now, we have over 600 HR specialists across the country that provided some great expertise even remotely to these clients and a huge compliance team behind them and legal and marketing that would take the rules and regulations coming out of the Fed and the state governments, boil those down, make them understandable and train our HRGs who then train those clients on how to handle it. And I think that\u2019s not going to go backwards. I think especially even for the next year. Now, the issue is, how do I hire someone, how do I retain them, how do I keep them in my company with career pathing and development, and how do I use our products like data analytics that would show you this is what the pay might \u2013 you might want to charge \u2013 pay someone? This is how you might want to handle their development and do it all by the way remotely through our Flex app and paperless on-boarding and so forth. I think that\u2019s going to be the biggest demand and growth besides retirement and time and attendance and of course insurances, and even beyond that, of course there\u2019s merchant services that we sell through partnerships there is going to be pay-on-demand options that we already offer that will continue to grow all of those things, there is a tremendous. Once they see the value, that we can provide them, I think there is tremendous upside in the penetration. Efrain Rivera : Yes, just to build on that. Marty mentioned it in his comments, but I want to make sure people did not overlook it. We talked about three really important metrics that make us very constructive on our results going forward. One was client retention was at 85%, I mentioned, revenue retention ran about 400 basis points ahead of that. The client base grew 4%, which was in recent years one of the highest we had and that by the way as people pivoted to selling virtually in the first half of the year. But the third one, which we \u2013 which Marty mentioned, which is important is, we had 18% growth in worksite employees in HR related services and we now are at $1.7 million worksite employees served, we dwarf anyone else in the industry. So \u2013 and we think we\u2019re still only scratching the surface. So \u2013 and the revenue opportunity is multiples of payroll as I\u2019ve mentioned to all of you before, we think we still have a lot of opportunity. So, just the bolster in addition to everything else Marty said, the HR part of that equation that\u2019s important. Eugene Simuni : Great, thank you very much. Martin Mucci : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Hey, good morning Marty and Efrain. Hey Efrain, you talked a little bit about what you\u2019re expecting from a pricing standpoint, maybe a little bit less than normal for FY 2022. I\u2019m just wondering, you know today has the pricing competition changed at all or are you seeing aggressive pricing anywhere or has it been fairly normal? Martin Mucci : I think Kartik, I will take the \u2013 start at that one. I think it\u2019s been fairly normal. I think we really haven\u2019t seen \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, I think value and focus for our clients have been so much on the pandemic and the value that they\u2019re getting from our support during the pandemic and it\u2019s been so critical to them. We have not seen \u2013 we\u2019ve certainly seen a much better retention from going to competitors. So, we\u2019re not seeing people leave to go to competitors. And so, I think even as the pricing has gotten for a little while there seem to be a little bit of a step-up in a number of free months and stuff like that, but again that\u2019s quite back down and really don\u2019t see much change in the competitive environment. Efrain Rivera : Yes, Kartik, and if you look over a multiyear period and certainly look at where the trends landed and we look at retention by reason curves we call it. Price and value losses we would call that, it\u2019s not just price, what value is the client getting, they are significantly down. So, irrespective of what the environment is in pricing, the value that we\u2019re delivering and certainly, we know that anecdotally in our tech services model has been well received by clients and they seem to be voting this day. Kartik Mehta : And then Efrain, just on the float portfolio, I think you said, you can expect flat interest on funds held for clients. Are you anticipating any growth in the float portfolio as we have wage inflation and maybe pays per control improve a little bit and if this is a reflection on the yield or are you anticipating the float portfolio growth to be flat or down? Efrain Rivera : No, the portfolio itself we expect modest growth and because of what you said Kartik, we expect the pays per control are going to grow. We would say it\u2019s modest growth. And then the other components you \u2013 they at least stay at current levels. I think we\u2019re a little bit cautious just on the interest rate environment at one point. Sometimes we see the tenure going up to 1.6, 1.7 then it bounced back down to 1.4. So, I think we\u2019re a little bit cautious about getting more aggressive either on positioning or on calling out a higher increase in the flow portfolio, but we expect increases in the underlying funds and modest improvement from where we are. But we\u2019re not ready to get aggressive in terms of positioning the portfolio or our assumptions on interest rates. Kartik Mehta : Perfect. Thank you, both. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Samad Samana : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Good to see the strong close to the fiscal year. Maybe Efrain, if I could ask, I know we\u2019ve asked a lot of questions about the pays per control assumptions and the strong bookings, but how about the company\u2019s own hiring in what seems to be just a tight labor market. How should we think about where Paychex is in terms of direct sales capacity and how is your ability to hire and retain in sales right now? Martin Mucci : Yes, Samad, I\u2019ll take that one to start anyway. It\u2019s been good, I mean, we certainly have had some challenge I think on the front-end from a service perspective in some locations, but generally we\u2019ve really picked up in the last. We\u2019ve done a couple of things that have really picked up our hiring and filling those spots. We think we\u2019re in good shape. From a sales perspective, we\u2019re in very good shape from starting the year at full capacity with everybody in the seats, well trained and the products that we\u2019re offering and I think we feel good about that. We are seeing it as a very big challenge for our clients and that\u2019s providing some opportunities through again the employee retention tax credit and telling them how we can help them get dollars there that will help not only retain their employees, but they could use those \u2013 some of those dollars toward hiring too, you\u2019re seeing a lot of upfront bonuses and things like that that clients have never even considered before that we\u2019re helping advise them might be a good trend to start. Samad Samana : Great. And then maybe on the strong new bookings, I know it was asked, but maybe if we could double click, how should we think about it, may be stratifying by customer size and everything we think maybe kind of sub 20 where you\u2019ve seen strong business formation, sub 20 employees versus, kind of more in that upper end of your SMB focus so maybe like that 50 to 100 employee plus segment? Martin Mucci : Yes, that under 20 has been strong, just like you said because of new formation of businesses and we\u2019ve picked up very well there. I think on the mid-market, the fourth quarter saw a good increase and we looked at it over even 2019 because it was a tough compare or an easy compare, I guess I\u2019d say last year because there wasn\u2019t as much activity in the fourth quarter. We looked at it over 2019 and were up in the mid-market over pre-pandemic levels and in total, our power number hit a five-year high on the overall par that we sold. So, we feel good really kind of across the board mid-market more coming in the last quarter, and as we start this year, but fully staffed and ready to go and really seeing, you know now they\u2019re really trained on how to sell from home and now, of course, the visits are opening back up, we are getting back up to the referral channels, the CPAs, and current clients. We\u2019ve also introduced some technology last year on the client-side that helped us [probably] and mostly on the sub-20 or on the under-20 I guess I\u2019d say, an automated referral network that we introduced through the marketing team and the sales team, which tells clients hey, here\u2019s how far you are from free payroll or from other things that you can get by turning in one more referral and it\u2019s very easy to do. So, we view some technology to pick up on the referrals as well and give better leads in an addition to the normal methods. Efrain Rivera : Par by the way refers to our internal acronym for bookings. Martin Mucci : Oh sorry, yes. Efrain Rivera : Okay, I get that question on par. Martin Mucci : Annualized revenue. Samad Samana : Great. Thanks again for taking my questions and good to see the strong execution. Efrain Rivera : Great. Thank you, Samad. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess the first one I wanted to ask was just a numbers one, Efrain you noted at 1.7 million worksite employees, we\u2019ve talked about kind of 18% year-over-year growth in that metric in the fourth quarter. I\u2019m just wondering if we could drill into, kind of those same metrics on PEOs specifically, do you have kind of a ballpark WSE number there and maybe the magnitude of growth on that metric year-over-year in the fourth quarter? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So, we combine both. And the reason we did \u2013 we\u2019re not splitting it out Andrew, is that from our perspective when we go in front of a client if they want to pivot to an ASO model [that\u2019s ASO] that gives us comparable revenue not quite as much as PEO depending on whether they take insurance as you know, or they don\u2019t. So, the 18% is where we grew year-over-year, wasn\u2019t a Q4 number and the combination of both were very strong in the year. Andrew Nicholas : Okay. And maybe as a follow-up to that, have you noticed any kind of material change in clients\u2019 preference between ASO and PEO over the past couple of months. I think they\u2019ve generally lean towards ASO, since the pandemic started, but just wondering if there is any evolution of that demand balance here since we last spoke? Martin Mucci : Yes. Andrew, I think the PEO side, we saw coming on stronger towards the end of the year. I think, again, the big challenge out there now for businesses is hiring and retaining employees and a benefits package and a very solid benefits package and easy to enroll is all \u2013 is going to become part of all of that package that you\u2019re trying to get to attract employees and keep them. So, we do see insurance picking up some. Now we can provide insurance through the agency directly or through the PEO, but \u2013 and you\u2019re also seeing, Texas and Florida picking up speed, as well as you\u2019d expect since they\u2019ve been pretty open, but again it\u2019s a challenge to find people although it\u2019s a little easier to find them there in those two states frankly than in other areas of the state. So, I think PEO will pick up some. It\u2019s just been slower to pick up because the focus has been more on the HR need. Now the HR need, be it \u2013 and the HR need being how do I handle things like I mentioned like vaccination policy, people working from home, new flexible schedules, now it\u2019s shifting to not only that, but also how do I hire and retain in a really tough market to find people and I think one of those things is going to be benefits and insurance. Andrew Nicholas : Great. Thanks to you both. Martin Mucci : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Jeff Silber : That\u2019s close enough. It\u2019s Jeff Silber, good morning. Martin Mucci : Good. Yeah, go ahead. Jeff Silber : No worries. I know it\u2019s late. I\u2019ll just ask one. Marty you were talking a little bit about the challenges that you\u2019re seeing in terms of your own internal hiring on the service side and then throughout the comments you\u2019ve talked about some of the challenges that your own clients are seeing. I\u2019m just curious, I know there\u2019s been a lot of studies as to why folks are seeing those challenges. What are you hearing? And what are you seeing? Why are people not taking these drugs? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think you\u2019ve heard, certainly the unemployment benefits being high until Labor Day, at least in most areas of the country, I think that\u2019s one. I do think there is still a lot of confusion about COVID and there is health concerns, you know that people are afraid like coming back, is everyone vaccinated or not, do I have to sit near someone, what\u2019s the risks. I also think that there is still just a lot of childcare issues as well. We hear that from clients. You know that schools are still kind of \u2013 and daycares are open or partially open, but there may be going now to summer schedules as well and I think people are just kind of playing it, kind of careful to come back and there is cash account, bank accounts, whether you\u2019re in the market or not. If you\u2019re in the market, the market\u2019s way up and you\u2019re feeling pretty confident of your financial position. If you\u2019re not in the market, but you have stimulus payments, you\u2019ve still got some of the highest cash accounts. I think if you look at the stats across the country that we\u2019ve [had in year]. So people are feeling like they\u2019ve got some financial wherewithal at least temporarily to probably get through the next couple of months. And then I think honestly, it\u2019s going to open up pretty drastically in the fall, would be my take, because the unemployment is going to come back down, as well as the rules of looking for work. The schools should be back open full hopefully and daycares. I think, even more will be known obviously about COVID and the impacts of vaccinations. Hopefully vaccinations are up strongly as well by all those. Now you start to get the September, October, I think things are going to open and people are going to be getting back to work as cash account start drifting down a little bit. Jeff Silber : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks so much. Martin Mucci : All right. Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thanks and congrats. Hey, I wonder from a margin perspective, as opposed to specific 2022 [indiscernible] think about like what the cloud transition can you need to the business longer-term. And as you\u2019re seeing the margin investment is \u2013 reinvestment or other some of that also the one-off from some of the corporate tax reform investments you made back in 2017. So, I guess is there any way to frame how much the cloud transition and then ultimately, some of that run-off from the 2017 investments, what that could mean for the margins over the next couple of years, just obviously there\u2019s other puts and takes there, but just those two\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Yes, so let me address that. I think that, very little of it was run-off from the 2017 investment. There are actually a few projects that are still continuing that has we started in that time, so they were longer range projects. So very little of it is, is the run off. And what I mean by that, Kevin, is that, some of that had to be incorporated in the business in order to drive the efficiency that you are seeing. And part of the way, some of those investments were structured where that we would accept higher IT spending in exchange for efficiencies in other parts of the organization. I think that what you\u2019ve seen is on the operation side significant efficiencies and the team has done a great job of leveraging the investments we\u2019ve made, I\u2019d say that\u2019s one. I think the second part is simply that I mentioned earlier, is when you go through one of these experiences, and do some geographic optimization that help, but you also look at what expense you actually need and you realize you don\u2019t need [$1.00], maybe you need $0.99 and I think that where we had that opportunity which got the opportunity for us to eliminating the cost out of the model. Kevin McVeigh : That\u2019s helpful. And just it seems, if we have [indiscernible], as you go more DIY, smaller average client size is more to [indiscernible] month that kind of build the average client size is today, the reason I\u2019m trying to make that point is obviously opens equal smaller clients for higher retention or more turnover, but you\u2019re getting better retention overall. So, maybe help us [indiscernible] dynamics a little bit? Martin Mucci : Yes, it\u2019s still. I\u2019ll start with it. It\u2019s still in the mid-teens free average client size. In some areas it has gone up a little bit actually and in others it\u2019s decreased, but I think we\u2019re still hanging in that mid-teens time frame or in that mid-teens size. And I think that it hasn\u2019t had a big impact on retention. I think what\u2019s really had the big impact on retention is the value we\u2019ve delivered during the pandemic, in particular, and of course certainly some macroeconomic effects of people just wanting to say, hey, I\u2019m going to focus on kind of battened down the business and not do a lot of change right now. And we\u2019re expecting that to continue based on the value we\u2019ve provided them during the pandemic that they\u2019ve seen and experienced. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thank you. Martin Mucci : Right, thanks. Efrain Rivera : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Hey, thank you very much, Marty and Efrain for all the details and color. I\u2019m wondering if on this point of hiring and recruiting etcetera, how you\u2019re feeling about the current product and services the Paychex can offer, and I know that can be a contributor, but I\u2019m just wondering if there is incremental opportunity to expand and improve those or tie them into other services? Just trying to think about kind of this bottleneck that everybody seems to be dealing with right now and how you can help address that? Martin Mucci : I think the investments we\u2019ve made over the last couple of years, really making on-boarding of new employees very easy for our clients have been really important, it\u2019s all paperless, it can now be done online and the partnership with Indeed is really picked up very well. The fact that Indeed gives credits to our clients for their early postings and so forth and get some of that kind of to the top of the list for posting. So from the standpoint of as soon as you let someone go, we can alert you to the fact that you can post that job now on Indeed, which is integrated with Paychex Flex. Indeed will post that job, if someone \u2013 as candidates apply for that job, you can now see all that through Flex, you can do video interviews, you can onboard that employee and all of their information that frankly they can setup by themselves, the person that\u2019s applying for the job and all of that can be done and then improved and set up and run a payroll and all of their other HR products from us all paperless without ever anyone touching anything. So, I think that is continue \u2013 that is going to help a lot in the hiring process and the integration with Indeed is going to help people get posted out of the biggest job board frankly in the world. So, we feel very good about the partnerships and then about all of the process being completely paperless and on-boarding. And then once they\u2019re in, all of the career development, the data analytics that we provide, the ability to communicate remotely through HR conversations where you can text within the app back and forth or message within the app back and forth all is very strong for hiring and retaining your employees. James Faucette : That\u2019s great, thanks a lot. Good luck. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Mark Marcon : Good morning, Marty and Efrain and congrats on a strong quarter and the positive outlook. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk a little bit about where you feel like you might be gaining share. When we talk about like, obviously the new business formations are helpful, but it sounds like you\u2019re probably getting more than your fair share within new business formations. And then, how can you \u2013 how would you describe the competitive environment in terms of where some of the gains are coming from and where things are still challenging? And then I\u2019ve got a follow up. Martin Mucci : Okay. I think the gains, obviously as you mentioned Mark are from new business formation. But also we\u2019re retaining a number of clients. From that standpoint, we\u2019re retaining more clients that would have gone to competition. We have not seen the losses as Efrain mentioned from price value that\u2019s improved. To go to competitors, that has improved, particularly our largest competitor. I think we\u2019ve done extremely well there from holding onto clients. The sales have also I think we\u2019re picking up much more from an HR perspective. A couple of years ago we started selling really not from just a payroll perspective, but from an HR perspective, because we saw we were leaving value on the table for what the client really needed and I think that has helped us a tremendous amount for a client to say, hey, I\u2019m not just looking for payroll, I\u2019m looking for an HR need and when you sell the HR need it has time and attendance, which then leads to the payroll and it\u2019s a total package. So, I think we\u2019ve seen a nice pickup from the way we sell, the way we market. Our leads are up double-digits from last year, from the way we\u2019re marketing on social media through the thrive conference, business conference we just had. I mean we have gotten much more sophisticated in the marketing and making the leads that we\u2019re getting much more efficient for the sales teams to be able to go out and sell. And then if they\u2019re not ready to buy, we have a great nurturing process of that lead that we have started a few years ago that I think is really matured extremely well. Mark Marcon : It sounds like the leads are up and clearly new business formations are up, but I\u2019m wondering like within new business formations, once you get the lead, it seems like the win rates are probably going up and I\u2019m wondering like who do you feel like you\u2019re winning more against, once you\u2019re going head to head? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think I would say, local \u2013 certainly it\u2019s always been local competitors who that are not offering the value. It\u2019s one of the things, local, regional competitors, smaller payroll companies, but some of our major competition too I don\u2019t think, have done as good a job in showing both the technology as well as the fact that, hey, we are available 365, seven days a week, 24 hours a day, if you need something you can do self-service, you can do it yourself, it\u2019s a great from a technology standpoint, but we\u2019re not trying to push you away from calling us when you need us with a specific question. Any time of the day or night and that\u2019s been very important as opposed to some that I think are trying to push into total self-service and becoming more of a Microsoft or Apple that it\u2019s too difficult to call them if you really need them in a jam, but so they can have the full options available to us. So, I think we\u2019re winning against local competitors. We\u2019re also winning against our major competitor through the breadth of products we\u2019re offering and the value and the client referrals have been very strong, particularly in the existing clients that we\u2019ve held through some of the pandemic coming in. Mark Marcon : Great. And then that segues into just, you know what the incremental efforts are going to be like over the course of this coming year. Can you talk a little bit about what you would anticipate in terms of sales force additions and also marketing spend both in traditional as well as digital? It seems like all of the competitors are picking up their media presence. So, I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about that, particularly in context of the really nice operating margin expansion guidance that you\u2019re giving? Martin Mucci : Yes, I think \u2013 as Efrain said, I think we\u2019ve done a good job in some of the things we did particularly in some of the facilities, initiatives and so forth to reduce costs that allowed us to not only gain the margins, but keep the investment in marketing going. Certainly we\u2019ve done as Efrain mentioned some brand work this year. Lot of pickup in the social media from that standpoint. We found I think very effective ways to spend our dollars in social and in SEM and SEO to be able to get a lot more attention and again to get more productive leads that are more efficient for our sales team as opposed to just a widespread any warmly that comes in, these are much more efficient from that standpoint. Sales growth, I think would be pretty normal from a sales team perspective and the good news is, that we\u2019re pretty much fully staffed, pretty close to being fully staffed and ready to go as we begin this fiscal year. We\u2019re seeing a good start to the year that came right out of the fourth quarter. Mark Marcon : Great and then last question, obviously you\u2019ve got a really strong balance sheet. You\u2019re going to throw off a lot of free cash flow. How should we think about capital allocation? Any areas of interest from an M&A perspective or return, obviously you\u2019ve got the \u2013 this stellar track record in terms of returning cash to shareholders, but just thinking about the balance between the two and also CapEx? Martin Mucci : Yes, sure. We just obviously, just increased the dividend feeling confident here in the last month or so, and increased the dividend on a normal basis, still got a very strong yield obviously. And we always continue to look at that M&A \u2013 from an M&A standpoint, continuing to look at all kinds of product tuck-ins, PEOs, you know everything that\u2019s out there. Valuations are pretty high. We\u2019re pretty particular is that what we\u2019re looking for, but we certainly feel good that we\u2019re in a solid cash position and gives in a lot of flexibility. Anything Efran you want to add? Efrain Rivera : Mark the only thing I\u2019d add is, two things \u2013 two things I would add, not the only thing. With respect to CapEx, we generally target about 3.5% to 4% of sales as a level of CapEx will be around there this year. And then we\u2019re keenly interested in the right technology. So, we do not have the attitude that it wasn\u2019t [invented here], we\u2019re not interested in it. We\u2019re actually interested in anyone\u2019s garage idea, if it\u2019s better than what we\u2019ve got. So, we do peer into garages and see what people are doing, most of it isn\u2019t interesting, but some of it is. So, we\u2019ll look for technology and obviously in addition to the areas that Marty mentioned. Mark Marcon : Great. Look forward to talking to you again a little bit later today Efrain. Take care, bye. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Mark Marcon : Thanks, Marty. Martin Mucci : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Neill with Goldman Sachs. Matt O\u2019Neill: Yes, hi, good morning gentlemen. Thanks so much for squeezing me, I know it\u2019s late. Just a quick one. This is probably one of the annual guidance\u2019s that you guys have issued that had a good deal of upside versus presented. Historically you guys have been pretty conservative and consistently able to, kind of increase guidance throughout the year. So, with the amount of uncertainty that probably still remains, is it safe to assume that the same principle that you guys used when setting annual [guidance holds] \u2013 and that the starting point here remains conservative in your mind? Efrain Rivera : I would say this Matt, well, that\u2019s a good question. I [indiscernible] you said that, there is an element of conservatism in our guidance. I mean, look, the good thing about having been here 10 years and the bad thing about having been here 10 years is the same thing. Everyone knows my MO. So, we\u2019ll issue guidance that we hope we can do a bit better than, but we also want to make sure that when an investor makes the decision about whether they want to hold Paychex versus something else, they know what they can expect and I think over the last decade, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve delivered. Matt O\u2019Neill: Understood. Thanks so much. Efrain Rivera : Great, thanks Matt. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien- tsin Huang : Hey, thanks. Real quick. I wanted to say congrats on the 50-year anniversary. That\u2019s a crazy stat especially in tech. So, if Tom Golisano is listening, congrats. I wanted to quickly I know Efrain, you guys \u2013 and Marty, you guys covered a ton. I know, just on the payroll client growth of 4% against service revenue being 1%, I know there is a lot of factors that drive the delta there, but just thinking about that incremental 4% and perhaps skewing smaller \u2013 with smaller revenue per client, is that something you saw coming out of the pandemic and the short payroll maybe contributing a little bit more to the client growth and how might that evolve as we look at fiscal 2022? Efrain Rivera : Yes. That\u2019s a good question. So, yes, I think it\u2019s fair Tien-tsin to say that it\u2019s skewed a bit smaller. Having said that, you know our model is \u2013 we take clients of all levels and as Marty mentioned. In the first half, the mid-market was more challenging because of driving everyone to virtual and then we had strength as we came out of the year. I think we\u2019ve optimized our model to produce margins that are really pretty impressive even when the clients are small. I think that for example, a SurePayroll client has a surprisingly high level of lifetime value, in part because they are being on-boarded onto a platform that\u2019s optimized for that size of the client. And so when we look at the portfolio, we\u2019re looking at everything from very low end clients to higher end clients and trying to get the mix right. We feel comfortable that we\u2019ve got that right and that next year maybe you\u2019ll skew a little bit less to the small and \u2013 a little bit bigger, so average client size, maybe has a chance to tick up. But despite all of that, we had a good year overall from a client growth standpoint. Tien- tsin Huang : Okay. Thoughtful. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Peter Christiansen with Citi. Peter Christiansen : Good morning. Thank you for the chance to back clean-up today. Also wanted to say, great execution in a tough year, certainly. Martin Mucci : Appreciate it. Peter Christiansen : Marty, I was just \u2013 there is also a strong year on the product development front, you had the [PEO program], you acted fast on the PPP Program, Clover integration and bunch of other things that you mentioned, but from the product development point of view, what are like some of the priorities that you\u2019re thinking about over the next 12 months to 18 months? Where are you spending the bulk of your resources on \u2013 in that avenue that would be helpful? Thank you. Martin Mucci : Yes, I think Peter what you\u2019re going to see is a lot more of self-service you\u2019re seeing with, it was accelerated a lot with the pandemic that people, you know we always have been moving that way and have done a lot of work as I\u2019ve mentioned a number of times on the call about self-service. But I think you\u2019ll see even more of that. Clients want the ability to be able to do things and their employees and want their employees to be able to do things on their own and that\u2019s probably no surprise. You\u2019ll see us continue to offer that and to work to continue to make that simple on our mobile app. The app is still a five star mobile app. We\u2019re very proud of that. We keep things as simple as we can. And it is, I said it\u2019s everything is developed mobile first. So, we design it for the mobile app and that has continued to pay off for us and I think you\u2019ll see things like the fact that employees of our clients are now making all of these changes for their bank accounts and their address changes, that happened relatively quickly over the last year or so that that has gotten over 80% usage by the employees of the client, that helps the client, that helps us to focus our service people on more value-added conversations and so forth. So [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Ladies and gentlemen one moment please. We are experiencing technical difficulty, your conference will resume momentarily. [Operator Instructions] Ladies and gentlemen, we did experience technical difficulty. [Indiscernible] This will conclude today's conference call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Paychex First Quarter Fiscal '22 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this call may be recorded and I will be standing by should you need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, Martin Mucci. Please go ahead. Martin Mucci : Thank you. And thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex first quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2021. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start today's call with an update on the business highlights for the first quarter, and Efrain will review the financial results for the quarter and provide an update on fiscal '22 guidance. We will then open it up for questions. Fiscal '22 is off to a very strong start with Q1 results above our expectations. Total revenue increased 16% with double-digit growth in both Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance Solutions while total expenses declined by 1%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 41%. While results benefited from the compare to a pandemic-impacted first quarter last year and improvements in the economy, our internal execution has been strong with continued momentum in sales, marketing and client retention. During the first quarter, positive macroeconomic trends continued. This was evident in the growth in checks per payroll and net increase in worksite employees within our existing base of HR outsourcing clients, particularly with our ASO offering. Our client retention remains near record levels, reflective of both the resilience of small businesses and the value provided by our unique blend of software solutions and HR expertise. Our sales momentum continued with strong first quarter sales performance as measured by new annualized revenue, reflecting solid performance in digital sales, our mid-market sales and our HR outsourcing divisions. Our unique value proposition of combining the most comprehensive human capital management software platform with our deep HR expertise continues to resonate with prospective clients. We continue to invest in our sales force and support them through increased digital marketing and lead generation initiatives. We are well positioned for the upcoming selling season. We continue to leverage our investments in research and development to expand the capabilities of our industry-leading software, Paychex Flex. Our investments in self-service, artificial intelligence and machine learning and analytics, payments, wearables and voice recognition allow us to offer cutting-edge technology, specifically designed to deliver automation and efficiency to both administrators and their employees. Our recent Pulse of HR reported -- survey reported identified hiring retention and software automation to gain efficiencies as the top industry trends facing businesses of all sizes. Our fall release introduces a series of software enhancements to further strengthen the power of Paychex Flex. We currently offer 2 options for clients in their search for talent, a fully integrated connection, API connection with Indeed, the world's largest job board for clients who are looking for a pool of applicants; and a comprehensive recruiting and applicant tracking offering called Flex Hiring for businesses looking for integrated technology to manage the entire recruiting process. We made enhancements both to provide clients with tools they need to post jobs, attract candidates and allow new hires to digitally self-onboard via our Flex mobile application. With employee retention being a significant issue in this challenging environment, we've introduced several enhancements to provide our clients with insights and offerings designed to help them in making informed decisions and retain their workforce. The introduction of retention insights, our first client-facing predictive analytics was designed to identify employees who may be at risk of leaving, for example. Second is pay benchmarking, which allows employers to compare performance ratings and compensation details by position to ensure top performers are paid equitably. With our advanced technology, employers can easily compare individual employee compensation against national averages provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to confirm the impact of compensation on retention. We're excited also to announce a new offering called Paychex Pre-Check to fully -- to further automate the payroll process for employers and provide their employees an opportunity to review their gross to net calculation before payroll is officially processed. With Paychex Pre-Check, employees are notified through their channel of choice, their phone, their tablet, their smart watch or their smart speakers, that they have a pending pay period to review. The employee leverages Paychex Flex to either confirm the amount of their check or report an issue. Issues are routed electronically to allow clients to focus on exceptions and proactively address issues prior to pay day. Paychex Pre-Check leverages our industry-leading Flex payroll and time and attendance offerings, HR Connect offering, our digital employee case management tool, our advanced analytics module, our 5-star rated mobile app and expands our conversational UI capabilities, including our integration with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri Shortcuts. With these additions, Paychex Flex is the first HCM application to offer integration with 3 of the major voice assistant platforms. Paychex Pre-Check was recently recognized by HR Executive Magazine in the HR Tech Conference and Exposition with the Top HR Product of the Year Award, an award that spotlights innovation driving the HR technology market. This is a 3-peat for us, marks the third consecutive year that Paychex has been recognized as a top HR product innovator by HR Tech. In addition to our innovative technology, the expertise and advice we're able to provide clients on HR matters really sets us apart. Our HR professionals have been very important in helping ASO and PEO clients to navigate through the pandemic and in handling the current uncertainty around COVID with the recent uptick in transmission rates, return-to-office plans and potential vaccine mandates. We are very proud of the work our HR professionals do, and we're honored to be recognized by winning a gold Human Capital Management Excellence Award from the Brandon Hall Group in the category of best use of a blended learning program for our HR Services Excellence Academy training program. This training program prepares our new HR professionals to provide exemplary consulting services to the company's HR outsourcing clients and was recognized for combining instructor-led training with technology-based activities. The expertise we offer our clients also expands, providing resources to assist clients with their many compliance obligations. Our COVID response continues near real-time updates to our COVID-19 help center, where businesses can access key information regarding changing regulations, including the recent Biden administration proposal and vaccine mandates. We assisted our clients in receiving over $65 billion in Paycheck Protection loans. That's 9% of the total PPP loans provided. And our industry-leading PPP forgiveness tools and reports have been accessed over 500,000 times since its release with over 90% of businesses now reporting their initial loan has been forgiven. We have also been instrumental in helping clients secure over $4 billion in stimulus funds available through the employee retention and paid leave credits. We recently launched an enhanced offering, the Paychex Employee Retention Tax Credit Service to help businesses retroactively identify tax credit eligibility based on wages already paid and file amended returns to claim the credit. On average, Paychex clients are claiming over $150,000 in tax credits, a substantial amount for a small or midsized business, that is helping them survive and thrive in this pandemic. The pandemic has only exacerbated the retirement crisis in America. In response a growing number of states have introduced state-mandated retirement programs, and our Pooled Employer Plan, or PEP offering as well as traditional plans have helped our clients handle new state mandates in ways that make financial sense for the employer and employees. For the 11th consecutive year, Paychex has earned the distinction as the largest 401(k) record keeper by a total number of 401(k) plans, serving more than 96,000 plans. We have seen continued success in helping clients find retirement plans that suit their employees' needs and help them to attract and retain clients. We are very proud of our performance during the first quarter but remain vigilant about the rest of the fiscal year given the uncertainty around the macroeconomic environment and the COVID-19 variance. Our very strong start in sales, continued client base growth, best-in-class operating margin and increased investment in marketing, lead generation and product development have us well positioned for continued financial and operating success during the remainder of fiscal year '22 and beyond. I'd like to close my comments by recognizing again the company's 50th anniversary. From our founders' start with $3,000 and a few clients, we have transformed into a comprehensive, technology-driven human capital management software company with over 710,000 clients across the U.S. and Europe. In addition to paying 1 in every 12 American private sector employees, we are the country's largest 401(k) record keeper, a top 30 U.S. insurance agency and among the largest providers of HR outsourcing in the U.S. supporting over 1.7 million worksite employees. While the size and the breadth of the company has changed, we remain true to our original mission of serving the unique needs of small and midsized businesses. That mission was all the more important during the challenges faced over the past 18 months. I'd like to thank and commend our employees for their tireless dedication to innovation and commitment to serving our clients. They have driven our growth over these 50 years. And our shareholders, we thank them for their investment with us along the way. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the first quarter. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Marty, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to remind you to sort that today's conference call contains forward-looking statements refer to the customary disclosures. I'll move through my comments relatively quickly so we can get to your questions. I'll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income, EBITDA, et cetera. Please refer to our press release, investor presentation for more information on these measures, especially on the investor presentation, too, if you want to have a clear roadmap in terms of what's included and what's not on the adjustments we make. I'll start by providing some of the key points for the quarter and then follow with greater detail in some areas. I'll finish with a review of our fiscal 2022 outlook, which as you saw was revised upwards. First quarter reflected strong internal execution, improved economic environment and favorable compares against the prior period. Both service revenue and total revenue increased 16% to $1.1 billion as we benefited from improved employment levels, higher client counts across all of our solutions. Growth rates were bolstered by a more easy compare to the prior year first quarter that was impacted by the pandemic. But as Marty said, we also had very strong execution in the quarter. Within service revenue, Management Solutions increased 17% to $805 million. And PEO and insurance revenue increased 14% to $263 million. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 3% for the quarter as lower average interest rates and realized gains were partially offset by higher average investment balances. We'll see what happens in the balance of the year as interest rates have started to move higher. Total expenses decreased 1% to $640 million, excluding onetime costs of $31 million that occurred during the first quarter fiscal 2021, expenses increased to modest 4%. The growth in expenses was impacted by higher PEO direct insurance costs, increases in fringe benefits and continued investment in product development and information technology. One thing I'd like to point out here that's important is if you go back to the first quarter of 2020, our performance was strong even when we measure against that quarter. So not only did we have strong compares against a COVID-impacted quarter, but go back to 2020, and you'll see this was a strong quarter overall. And I think it says fundamentally something important about how the company has transformed over the last 2 years. Op income for this quarter increased 56% to $443 million with an operating margin of 41%. Adjusted operating margin was also 41% during the first quarter compared with 33.8% for the prior year, an expansion of more than 700 basis points. Effective income tax was 24.9% compared to 23.4%. The first quarter was impacted by an increase in state tax provisions. Both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to stock based compensation benefits. As you know, we exclude those for purposes of our adjusted calculation. Adjusted net income increased 42%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 41% for the quarter to $323 million and $0.89 per share, respectively. Investments and income, our primary goal, as you know, is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. The long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.8% and average duration of 3.4 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.1% for the quarter, down from 1.3% in the prior year. Now let's look at our financial position. It's in a nutshell, pretty strong. It remains strong with restricted cash and total corporate investments over $1.2 billion. Our borrowings were $805 million as of August 31. Cash flow from operations was $386 million during the first quarter, a robust increase of 79% from the same period last year. Free cash flow generated was $354 million, up 83% year-over-year. The increases were driven by higher net income and changes in working capital. We paid quarterly dividends of $0.66 per share for a total of $238 million during the first quarter. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was a stellar 42%. Now let me turn to guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2022. This outlook reflects the current macro environment, which saw improvement in the quarter, especially in June and July. First quarter results exceeded expectations. Nevertheless, as all of you know, there's uncertainty about the trajectory of the remainder of the next several quarters. So we've incorporated this into our expectations for the remainder of the year. Our crystal ball is clear and near we are and a little bit less clear as we go out, and now we're into the spring of next year. So with all that said, Management Solutions, we expect it to grow now approximately 8%. That's guided upward from 7% -- approximately 7%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 8% to 10%. That's similar to what we said previously. Interest on funds held for clients, still expected to be flat year-over-year. Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 8%, again, guided upwards from 7%. Adjusted operating income is expected to be in the range of 38% to 39%, up from previous guidance of approximately 38%. And if there's a point I would make simply it's this, that we went through a pandemic, we made a lot of adjustments in the operating margin, and our returns are really, really strong. Adjusted EBITDA margin now is expected to be approximately 43%, up from previous guidance of approximately 42%. Other income and expense net is expected to be in the range of $23 million to $26 million. Our previous guidance was in the range of $33 million to $37 million. The change is due to certain non-operating income received during the first quarter. And then specifically before I get the question on that, let me just say that we have invested in a technology fund. We received a mark that ended up in us recognizing income on that technology fund, which invests in early-stage technology companies. Our effective income tax is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 12% to 14%. We previously guided to growth of 10% to 12%. Turning to the second quarter. We currently anticipate total revenue growth will be in the range of 7% to 8%. And adjusted -- remember, it's adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 36% to 37%. Before I get the call, I will just say on everything, there's an element of conservatism in what we say, in part because the macro environment does impact -- we don't obviously have a crystal ball on when it happened in the second quarter and beyond, and we're trying to create an all-weather forecast. Now of course, all of what I just said is subject to current assumptions, which can change given the current environment. We'll update you again on the second quarter call. I'll refer you to our investor slides on the website for more information. And now, with all of that, I'll turn it over to Marty. Martin Mucci : Thank you, Efrain. Ashley, we will now open the call for questions, please. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Very nice results. Duly noted on the conservatism for the rest of the year, but the first quarter revenue and earnings outperformance actually exceeds the increase in the annual guidance by about $18 million in revenue and adjusted EPS by $0.03. So can you flesh out your thinking on the remaining 3 quarters of the year, perhaps talking about your outlook for employment bookings and any other factors besides conservatism that might be keeping the next 3 quarters, let's say, below where they might have been given the first quarter outperformance? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Let me handle that, David. I think there's 2 pieces to the way we look at the year, what we see in the first half and what we see in the back half. So I would say with respect to the EPS, we've factored into our assumptions additional hiring as the year progresses, which will add a bit to expenses. So I think that's the first part of the equation. The second part is that we do not, at this point in our guidance, contemplate that the unemployment picture is going to change significantly. So to the extent that it does, that it is significantly -- or it's improved from where we are, that would be upside to our case. We simply are at a point where we had in the first quarter a nice rebound in terms of the number of employees on the payroll. That obviously helps from a revenue standpoint. What happens going forward, we simply have to try to estimate what we think is a reasonable, as I said, all-weather scenario. Those are really kind of the 2 things that are driving it. And I would say this on the back half of the year because I'll get questions on that. The back half of the year we\u2019ll see where we come out of Q2 and then get a better feel for it, understand we were very strong in the first quarter. There is conservatism in what we've guided to, and we could do better. But as everyone on the call knows, there is uncertainty about a number of things in the macro environment that we want to make sure that investors have completely taken into account and to assure investors that we've taken it completely into account. So all of that mouthful was in the forecast. David Togut : Just as a quick follow-up. Efrain, you called out strength in mid-market bookings in the quarter. Is that an industry phenomenon where mid-market generally was stronger than expected in Q2? Or is that a function of market share gains? Martin Mucci : Well, I think -- Dave, it's Marty. I think it's really been -- we were going fairly slower than we expected in the second half of last year, and we really had a nice pickup in the first quarter. I think it's really -- I don't think it's necessarily the environment. I think this was really much more success in sales. We had done a number of things in training. Of course, the product adds that we have been doing from a technology standpoint to the software. So I think it was really more performance. We're really pleased with the pickup in mid-market, and we think we're really well prepared for selling season as well. Operator : We will take our next question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask about sort of what you see as the biggest drivers of this nice margin beat in the quarter. I know you mentioned you made some pandemic-related expense adjustments. I'm just trying to understand the degree to which of those adjustments you made will prove to be the most sort of impactful and lasting? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So Ramsey, let me -- I made a comment which during my prepared comments about the compare to 2020, and I think that's important. You can go back. These are matters of public disclosure. If you look at what happened with expenses, our expenses are pretty flat against 2020. There's 2 things, one of which is likely nonrecurring, but one of which is very recurring and is part of our strategy. So I keep harping on the idea that we've been on this journey and transformation as a technology-enabled services provider. And look, I can say whatever I want to, and Marty can say whatever he wants to, but if it's not evident in the P&L, that speaks for itself. If you look at our expenses, they're essentially flat with 2020, quarter 1. Now why is that? Obviously, they should be somewhat up. So there's an element of this that really has to do with delayed or deferred hiring. The labor market is tight. It's not necessarily easy to get all of the people that you want in place. We are adequately hired, but we're a little bit behind where we would have expected to be hired at this point. Part of the question that David asked earlier is why wouldn't you see even more flow-through? The short answer is that we expect to hire as we go through the year, perhaps not at the rate that we would have previously, but certainly at a rate that is higher than the first quarter.  But leave that to a side, the reality is that when we took a restructuring charge in the first quarter, it yielded benefits -- I'm sorry, in the first quarter of last year, it yielded benefits this quarter. When we looked at our headcount and looked at those metrics of efficiency, we are more efficient as a company today than we were in 2020. And that is what's driving a lot of what you're seeing. More investment in technology, less investment on -- in other areas of the business that are not needed, frankly, at this point, is driving the efficiency that you're seeing and the results that we delivered. Ramsey El-Assal: I see. Okay. One follow-up for me. In the slide presentation, I think under Management Solutions, you mentioned some pricing realization. And I'm just curious, have you seen any changes on the sort of positive or negative side to the pricing environment as we emerge from the pandemic? I guess it's a backdoor way of asking about the competitive environment and where there's more opportunity or less opportunity the same amount of opportunities before to modify prices. Martin Mucci : I think we still have very good pricing power based on that. I think we've seen the revenue per client go up, and we've sold them more products as well. So we've really seen that -- I think from a competitive standpoint, when you just get right to that point, I don't think we've seen a lot of changes. What we have seen though is that the work we were able to do for clients during COVID, the support we were able to provide them, excuse me, and the products that we are going to provide them to help them get loans now, to help them in a really a great automated fashion, get an employee retention tax credit, for example, this makes a huge difference from a competitive standpoint of retention and even from a prospect perspective as to whether they're aware -- and from a prospect perspective, it's, \"Hey, were you even aware that you could get this retention tax credit, and do you know how much this can bring you to help you with hiring new employees or retaining your current employees?\" For our current clients, the level of support we were able to show them and demonstrate to them during a very difficult time really has made the difference. So I think it's -- I think the competitive environment is just as strong, but I think we've been able to have an opportunity and then have shown what we can do, and that's given us an even stronger position than we would have had beforehand. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Bryan Bergin : Can you comment on how demand trended within the quarter? So results and commentary are certainly positive here. But taking into account the conservative view, I'm curious if you actually did see any deterioration as you exited August or even in September relative to maybe June and July due to the variance? Martin Mucci : Yes, Bryan, not really from the sales side, we have not. We think we're well prepared to kind of our selling season that picks up here over the next month or so and toward the end of the year. But we think we're very well prepared. We think we haven't really seen anything. It's been pretty consistent through the quarter. We really -- again, I'll mention mid-market was strong. Digital -- any digital sales were strong. And we also have seen very good results on our HR outsourcing, both PEO and ASO. So it's not like it started strong and in the beginning of the summer went down. It actually has been pretty consistent. And we actually think there's some opportunity from a sales perspective this month and over the next few months across the board, including retirement, and retirement has been very strong as well. Efrain Rivera : And Bryan, I think you're -- I don't want to anticipate what your -- the base question was. But I would say if we looked at the macro indicators that we were seeing, June and July were really strong. I mean not -- these aren't micro, I want to make that clear. June and July were strong, and August was softer. So we'll see when we come out of September. But at this stage, to Marty's point, it's not impacting the business. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Okay. Understood. And then on the Management Solutions growth, can you give us a sense of the mix of the drivers of that 17% in that outperformance? How should we think about check volume recovery versus new units and cross-sell versus pricing? Any of these stand out more than others? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Good question and a fair point. So the first thing I'd say is to sort of step -- take a step back because Management Solutions is not entirely a payroll game. It's really kind of, in important respects, got 3 pieces, so the HCM part, retirement services and HR outsourcing. So those are the 3 big buckets, if you will, in Management Solutions. I would say I couldn't see anything on the PEO that was a major revenue line that wasn't up double digits. So on the HCM side, we benefited from upper single-digit pays per control. So that was helpful. Now that's not surprising. We had a pretty big decline in the first quarter. But in addition to that, there was pricing and also client base growth. So all of those were driving that result. On the HR outsourcing side, we simply had a great year last year, had more worksite employees served, and that drove that result. And then on retirement services, Marty talked about that. Retirement services is gaining steam across the country, and we are certainly benefiting from it with mandates in multiple states now. Our pet product, we feel -- we are and I don't feel it, we believe it and see it that we're well positioned. So when you look at all of those 3, it took all of those 3 to drive that result. It wasn't solely an HCM story. And I think it plays to the fact that we sell in an integrated way, and we've benefited from that in terms of the point that Marty made earlier, which is we're getting better revenue per client. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Efrain, you kind of -- you made a comment on the call that the company is fundamentally transformed and I firmly believe that's the case. I wonder if you could help us frame where you think you're going to see that. I mean it sounds like the retention continues to bump at record highs. Is there a new range for that? I mean, clearly, just -- I'm just going to ask one question, but just to maybe weave in the client growth, right, I mean you picked 75,000 clients, that's 11% growth. I don't think you've ever done that. So I mean, it seems like the business is poised for structurally higher growth. I don't want to get too far ahead of myself here, but can you help us understand where that sits, particularly given the leverage on the margin side as well? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So Kevin, I'd say the 75,000 is probably over a period of years. We disclosed that we were up above 710 and we had been in the high 600s the year before. But to your point, directionally, our client growth has been strong over the past several years, in part impacted by this move to digital that Marty talked about. So that's one part. The second part is that the move to digital brings with it the ability to operate at higher levels of efficiency, which is what you're seeing in the P&L. So that's a big emphasis within the company. And I would say shout out to all of my colleagues in operations who have done a phenomenal job and to the IT and product group who will also make that happen, can't happen any other way. So I'd say that's the second point. And then the third point, Kevin, to your point, last year, we ended -- as I mentioned to folks on the call, we were in the high 80s in terms of revenue retention. There is a natural ceiling on the amount of revenue growth -- I'm sorry, revenue retention we can have because of some of the markets that we operate in, meaning that the smaller clients tend to attrit more rapidly than larger clients, but all of that moved up. Previous to the pandemic, final point, we were in the 83% to 84% range. I would say that's the new Mendoza line for retention. And last year, we beat that. We hope to beat that and build off of that, and all of my colleagues in operations share that goal. Martin Mucci : I think also, Kevin, when you talk about transformation, having the chance to think about our 50 years in business and how it's changed so dramatically, the software enhancements that we're making consistently in front of our clients, it is providing them so much information in the artificial intelligence and the data analytics that we're providing and just talked about today with Paychex Pre-Check really allowing employees to be alerted that there here is their pay for this pay period. They can answer that. They hear about that on their mobile phone. They can hear about it from their smart speaker. So meaning that -- and we're tied in now -- we're the only company tied into all 3 of the major voice-assisted platforms. So it's saying, \"Your paystub is ready if you'd like to check it,\" and you can respond that you have checked. I think of the efficiency that it brings the employer and the administrator of the employer of the client and the employee as well now is this is really helping continue our retention at the levels that Efrain is talking about. Even though there's business failures in small business that keeps us at some point, at some level, this is really taking it to the highest level. And that on top of the COVID work that we did and the ability to update them and really provide support and dollars through the -- like employee retention tax credit is making a big difference. And it's really a very different company. It is a software-driven company that is using artificial intelligence and data analytics to give a tremendous amount of efficiency to our clients. Operator : And we will take our next question from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Mihir Bhatia : This is Mihir on for Jason. I wanted to ask -- maybe just staying on a similar topic in terms of just what you're seeing in the market right now. You've been talking -- we've talked a little bit about new business creation being pretty healthy recently. Has that continued in recent months? And then is there any type of quantification you can provide, just for example, in terms of your the percent of your wins coming from newly formed businesses or your win rates as you compete for these new businesses? Martin Mucci : Yes. I would say new business formations are down a little bit from last year now, but they're up from '20. They're still up very strong from pre-pandemic levels up 20% to 30% over pre-pandemic levels. Now there was a big jump last first quarter, and frankly, the first half of -- like our fiscal year, as we think about it, in new business formation. They were up 40%, 50%. Now they're up really 20% to 30% over the previous pandemic years. And we do very well with brand-new businesses. We certainly do well. As I mentioned, it picked up some real positive performance in the mid-market, but we're also doing very well with brand-new clients that are starting up. Obviously, we still have great relationships with CPAs and as well as banks in getting referrals. We're also able to do a lot of these sales digitally as we've really improved the ability for our clients to go online, look at our product, demo the product even on their mobile phone or online as well as then go right through to actually starting to set up and onboard themselves all digitally without talking to anyone. We certainly have a lot of pride in our field sales force and our digital sales -- our voice or telephonic sales force, but the digital sales is becoming a bigger part of brand-new businesses, obviously, and we're very proud of that. Mihir Bhatia : And then just if I could ask about the margin increase in the guidance. Is that being driven by the top line growth and some efficiencies of scale just from the top line growth flowing through? Or are there also been any changes to your underlying investment or expense plans for the year? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Let me just answer that. I think there always is some element of both. But I think it's driven more so by improvements on top line revenue. And I would say that because we have been able to do the things that we have done or the actions we've taken on the expense side, now when a dollar flows through, you get even more benefit than you would have otherwise. Although, as everyone knows, we have industry-leading margins to begin with. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : Can you touch on the PEO performance versus insurance performance in the quarter? And I know you're maintaining your guide on that revenue line in the aggregate, but is there any change to your expectations at that underlying level in terms of growth through the remainder of the year? Martin Mucci : No, I would say both are actually growing quite well. HR outsourcing in total is growing well, and I think we've positioned ourselves very well on the PEO side as well as ASO. I would say the PEO side has picked back up more recently. I think we talked about it last year, maybe the last couple of quarters that insurance wasn't as in demand at that time because of getting through the pandemic. That is starting to come back now more because of a sense of retention of your employees and hiring your employees. It's -- as you know, it's a very competitive market out there. And so now the insurance plans, your health insurance et cetera, your dental, your voluntary insurances, they're becoming very much a competitive offering to attract employees in a tough market and retain those that you have. So the interest in insurance has picked back up. So both our ASO and PEO, frankly, are double-digit growers and have done very well in the first quarter. Efrain Rivera : Andrew, when you do the arithmetic, so probably part of your question also is why not increase the guide, the short answer is that PEO continues to do pretty well. And the reason why you're at 8% to 10% versus double digit and above is that insurance is simply growing slower, still where we expected it to be, but we anticipate it growing slower than PEO for the year. Now we had a good first quarter that could prove to be incorrect. And then the other point that I would make is that -- and everyone is going to struggle with this, we just had to quaff Q4. Everyone had a very strong Q4, the compares against Q4 are the ones that are a little bit tough at this point to gauge completely, both on the top and the bottom line. We have a view of it, but we'll need to refine that as we go through the year. Andrew Nicholas : No, that's really helpful. And then maybe a longer-term strategic question, you talked a lot about success with digital sales. Is that something that you can apply your learnings and capabilities from to the PEO market? Or is that too involved in the sale? Or is there some middle ground that you're approaching or hoping to target longer term that could make that a more efficient process? Just wondering how that could be part of the strategy and maybe the puts and takes to consider on the PEO front. Martin Mucci : No, sure. We're actually already involved in it. It's basically -- what you're doing is also automating and digitizing a lot of the underwriting process and the information that you have to get, onboarding of clients, including in the PEO, we're looking more and more to go to employees to help them self-onboard and makes it easier on the client and the prospect itself as they're onboarding. And so it was sending a link to employees to say, \"Hey, give me your information, load your own information in and get started.\" That will transform, I think, over to the PEO side and certainly automation in the underwriting side, which makes -- will make the whole process faster. So, oh, yes, the digital -- there's going to be no limit to the selling from a digital standpoint. People are going to want to continue to find ways to have everything automated for them to be able to glean online, set themselves up, look at the product and buy you may still have some -- certainly, sales rep involvement on the complication of insurance plans and so forth, but we're always looking to make that easier and anything that a client can do for themselves or allow their employees to do for themselves is exactly where we're going strategically, and we've already made a number of steps that way. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Marty, I wanted to ask a little bit about sales distribution. I know this might be a little dated, but at one point, it accounted for 1/3. I think direct sales accounted for 1/3 and then kind of others. And you've talked a lot about digital sales improving and being a bigger part. I'm wondering, has the sales distribution or how Paychex acquires clients changed at all as a result of all the changes? Martin Mucci : Yes, Kartik, it definitely has. Accounts and banks are still important to us, accountants in particular, great relationship with them for many, many years and the assistance that we give them and support we give them for their clients as well. But that has definitely come down as a percentage, and digital has gone up as a percentage. I would say it's been a pretty steady change, and I expect it will probably even accelerate. So much more of our lead generation comes now from the marketing investments that we make, and marketing has become a very important part of the sales function and how sales gets their leads and then, frankly, how clients view us and then come in online and just decide to buy. As I mentioned, many clients now certainly under 10 employees at least can come into our website because they've seen us advertise somewhere or online through SEM and SEO and know that we're an expert in this field, come in, demo the product, compare the product and even buy the product and start to set themselves up. So yes, it's becoming a bigger -- certainly a bigger part of it. And of course, that leads to efficiencies that Efrain has been talking about. Kartik Mehta : And then, Efrain, just on the float, we've seen, obviously, rates move up a little bit over the last couple of weeks. And I imagine you'll benefit from any kind of wage inflation on the float portfolio. Any changes to how you might manage that over the next 6 to 12 months? And are you anticipating wage inflation to help the portfolio? Efrain Rivera : Yes. No, we do. And I think that clearly in the first quarter to help offset some of the drag. The short answer is it's interesting the market kind of moves in some ways based on concerns about inflation and stagflation. But in our case, that expectation is largely a positive when you look at it from a float and from a pricing perspective. So those aren't necessarily negative to us, where I would say we're in a heightened state of scrutiny on how to position the portfolio based on what we're seeing in credit markets and on the investment side. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Jeffrey Silber : Earlier, you talked about some of the labor tightness impacting your own ability to hire a bit. I know we talked a little bit about it last quarter about potentially that easing up a little bit in September when folks go back to school, childcare is easier and maybe on the unemployment subsidies kind of peter out. Did you see any impact? Or have you seen any impact from recent rates of things getting a bit easier? Martin Mucci : From a macro standpoint, I would say it's not showing up yet. I think it's -- what it's demonstrated to us -- and I started to see this through some of the data analytics work that our teams are doing here from our small business index, is that it wasn't -- it's not just the unemployment because you could see some of the states had cut the extra unemployment benefit out, and it really was not making a big difference in the who was going back to work. So I think what you're finding is it's going to take a little bit longer in the market. It's definitely still a tough hiring market. And I think that the cash balances, everyone -- you can see this data, cash balances are high, checking accounts are high because people haven't either spent or they also have gotten other stimulus money, whether it's child care or child tax -- or I'm sorry, child benefits that they're getting right now. People are in a pretty good stage, and I think they're still trying to test it out. Plus, I think there's just still healthcare worries about their businesses that they're going back to. Do they have to wear masks? Is there a mandate or not? And I think it's going to take a couple more months to shake out. It's certainly the hiring has gotten better. Our hiring growth is -- the hiring growth in our small business index has gotten much stronger in the last couple of months, especially in leisure and hospitality sectors and in other services sectors. But it's -- there's still a challenge out there in the hiring. So we expect it to pick up, but it's going to be a little bit longer than just -- it's not just the unemployment benefits that made the difference. Operator : We'll take our next question from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Samad Samana : I wanted to maybe ask a question on your own hiring. I know you guys talked about being a little bit behind. But can you tell us maybe with which part of the organization? Is it broadly? Or is it inside the quota-carrying sales reps side? Or is that the R&D side? Just how should we think about where you're playing catch-up on the hiring? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think it's more on the service side and frontline service. There's some in sales, but it's kind of spread, and it's not an overall large number in any sales division. So we feel good about that. We also -- and it's probably the hardest on the frontline service providers. John Gibson, who runs all of services, had done a great job with our HR team to find very creative ways, though the hiring has really picked back up. We've shifted to some different ways to encourage new employees to come in, different work schedules, different abilities, certainly work from home and a number of other benefits that they can get in the tools and support that they have. So it's picking back up now, particularly just in the last 30 days, but as Efrain said, it's a tough market out there to hire particularly frontline service people. But as we said, we still are seeing very strong client retention. We're getting the job done, and we're certainly driving more calls to the website, which our chat bot, our automated response to service questions and other questions are being answered 60% of the time by the automated response. You can always reach someone live at Paychex 24 hours by 7 days a week, 365 days a year. And -- but we are certainly looking for efficiencies, and we're hiring very creatively, and it's starting to pick back up again. Samad Samana : Helpful. And then Efrain, I know we've talked kind of a lot about the expense controls and how that's benefited the margin structurally. But gross margins have also continued to melt up nicely even with, call it, headwinds to some of that high-margin PEPM revenue. Just how should I think about maybe the tech stack on the -- on Flex and how that's driving gains on the gross margin side and maybe how much more room is there on the software stack to drive gross margin gains? Efrain Rivera : Yes. It\u2019s a great question, Samad. So let me answer it in 2 ways. The first I'd say is when you look at our gross margins and compare -- ignore for a second our operating margins. But if you look at our gross margins and compare against industry, we still are right at the top. And that's against the people who are \"pure software players.\" So look at the data, that's what I would say. We're proud of that. We understand that. We manage that. To your point, when I look at the data, and I mentioned, I think in response to an earlier question, it might have been Ramsey's question about the strength in Management Solutions, what was really notable about that was that it was widespread across the 3 major buckets of Management Solutions : retirement, HR and HCM. And what we're seeing is that our sales team has done a really good job of selling the entire, we call, value proposition of the company through what we call the power of 3,000. And the idea is that when we get in front of a client, we want to sell them the entirety of that value proposition. Now just one small digression on that point. You can only do that if you've got an integrated system, not just HCM, but integrated ancillaries. So when you sell that proposition and now you've upgraded to a module, there's essentially very, very low variable costs associated with that. And that's really what's helping to drive what we see. We are -- we have been selling a bit higher in terms of client size, but more importantly, we have been selling more modules especially on high-value ancillaries like HR. So you're right. All of that is driving the improved margin performance that you're seeing. Operator : And we will take our next question from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Just wanted to ask on managed solutions from maybe a slightly different angle. If you look at the revenue growth, I think it was up 500 basis points for Street estimate, and it was better than your expectations. So I'm just trying to figure out what exactly was the surprising strength in the quarter for you guys and just trying to figure out why that wouldn't repeat itself maybe in the next few quarters? Efrain Rivera : Well, I'd say this, Bryan. The first thing is that pays per control were solid. They were up, as I said, upper single-digits. You won't see that -- we don't think you'll see that in future quarters. So that's going to present a little bit of a compare issue. We did have better pricing in the quarter than we had versus the pandemic-impacted quarter last year. So what happened is we did take steps in that first quarter of last year to hold off on price increases until we had had a chance to let our customers take a breather that was unique to the quarter. And as we anniversaried it, that helped. And then the third thing is that clients were -- our client count was up significantly versus where we started the year last year. All of those things made Q1. The confluence of those things were really important. And then finally, HR really took off in the first quarter of last year. We saw the strength through the remainder of the year. But when you got the first quarter, now you saw the full annualized impact of that strength in HR. Hey, Bryan, there's an element of conservatism in our numbers. We'll see where we end up, but it won't -- we're not going to have the same revenue growth in the second quarter. And that's why, in addition to everything else, we know that Q1 had certain factors in it that don't repeat in other quarters. But there are some underlying factors that we've talked about through the balance of this call that will repeat as we go through, and we're a little bit conservative on the rest of the year. Bryan Keane : Got it. No, that's helpful for the going forward. But how about the quarter itself? When you guided originally, I don't think you expected it to be that strong. And some of those factors you just outlined, you would have known about that would have been on a comparative basis. So just trying to figure out the surprise in the quarter, what could possibly surprise that much? Efrain Rivera : Yes. The short answer as you're pressing me down is that it was better in almost all of those categories. So that's the short of it. Bryan Keane : Got it. Got it. And the only other question I have is just looking at some of your metrics compared to some of the global employment metrics and factors you see is your metrics seem to be stronger than kind of what we're seeing in the overall. I'm just trying to figure out if there's any thoughts or reasons why your data might be a little bit showing more strength than what we're seeing on a more macro basis? Martin Mucci : Bryan, which ones? Like the employment growth type of things? Bryan Keane : Yes. Yes, in particular, employment. Martin Mucci : I think -- well, I do think that the growth in small business and small to midsize, remember, our small business index, that piece of it is focused on clients under 50 employees. And I think there's been a nice recovery in leisure and hospitality, in particular, you're getting some back. Even though many restaurants in the hospitality service places are still struggling to find enough people, the growth and the recovery over the summer has been very strong. And so people have been getting back to work, and the demand has been there, certainly. So I think we might be seeing a little bit -- and they fell harder remember as well. So they fell a lot harder than larger businesses. And our study is focused more on 50 and below. They took a really hard hit. Many of them closed when you compare to last year, and now they're recovering faster because they had a bigger hit last year, I would say, in general. So... Operator : We'll take our next question from Eugene Simuni with Moffett. Eugene Simuni : The first, I wanted to come back quickly to retention levels. There's been, I think, a pretty broad-based expectation that retention levels might start to come down across the industry really as the economy opens up, as activity picks up. Sounds like in the first quarter, you guys still achieving very high levels of retention. Are you seeing any indication of kind of high churn as activity picks up? And as you're looking out into the rest of the year, are you still expecting some deterioration in retention? Is that maybe part of the conservatism? Martin Mucci : Yes. I mean I think we -- it may happen. We were -- we've been very happy with the retention, obviously, hitting record levels last year. And I do think what we're continuing to find from clients is we have really gained a lot, as I said earlier, from the COVID work that we did, the ability to help them turn in their paperwork for their loans in the last 18 months. Then we have 90% of our clients have been able to have their loans forgiven. A lot of that is we made it easy for them. We hear this time and time again that they were at a very dire point of going out of business, yet we helped them get the loans. We've partnered with 3 fintech companies to provide them another source for loans. We helped them with the forgiveness. And now we're coming back to them saying, \"Hey, you can have an employee retention tax credit and you can get the cash right away. It's not like waiting and here's how you do it, and we can do it all for you in a very automated fashion. And you can have on average $150,000 worth of cash in your pocket that you don't have to repay to the government.\" It's a huge stimulus to them. So it really has helped our retention. It gave us an opportunity to kind of show the full power of Paychex. And then on top of that, as Efrain said, I think more and more of those clients then saw the HR support as well, not just on the payroll side, but also in the HR support. And now they still need us to really help them through vaccine mandates, what do I do with work from home policies, how do I bring people back to work, how do I handle hybrid, how do I coach employees. All of the technology that we're showing them has really come to use for them, even some of the things that are so out there from a digital standpoint that their employees can do from their mobile phone. It really has given us a chance to show them, \"Hey, here's all the things you can do to retain, hire and grow your business and give you some cash in your pocket, and that has really helped retention a great deal. Efrain Rivera : Yes, Eugene, I mean, to your point, too, we had a great year in retention. We don't anticipate that we will be at that level, you see the impact of that retention over the course of the year. So that has some impact on where we get to. Where will we end up? We'll have a better sense of that when we get through Q2. We're not anticipating, nor are we planning on the idea that we're going to be at the same level of retention that we were last year. We'd love to do it, but probably not a realistic planning assumption. Eugene Simuni : And then secondly, I wanted to quickly ask about the ASO, PEO potential upsell opportunity. You mentioned it in the past couple of quarters that with the record strength in ASO growth, there might be some opportunity to convert some of the ASO clients to PEO clients now that folks are more interested or open to switching insurance providers. Are you pursuing that initiative? Is it yielding results? And is there more opportunity there to convert to greater PEO growth? Martin Mucci : Sure. There's -- one, we've had a lot of success in, as we said, in double-digit growth in both ASO and PEO. And we've been able to go into the client base and get them to an HR outsourcing product first. But as I mentioned, and as you just noted, the insurance is coming back. We had a good quarter on insurance, and you're seeing that in the PEO side in that it really is an environment where the #1 issue -- #1 or #2 issue with clients is how do I hire and retain people, and then how do I get more efficient. The hire and retain has become not just about comp, meaning pay, but it has become about benefits as well. And so it's been very important from that standpoint. So we are having some success certainly in continuing to upgrade our current clients and sell brand-new clients as well on both PEO and ASO solutions. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Mark Marcon with Baird. Mark Marcon : Just going to one of the conservatism questions, just in some states, such as Florida, where they did see a spike in Delta, did you see any sort of negative impact with regards to the weekly revenue trends when the spike occurred? Martin Mucci : I would say, actually, the best job growth has been in the South. So even while they picked up some more -- they obviously had more cases, you're seeing the best job growth from a macro standpoint and from our -- some of our sales in Florida, in Georgia, in Texas, where there is -- but that is also a function of great demand, right, that's going there. And there's more people there, migrating there, as everyone knows. And so you're seeing more businesses open up there. You're seeing more people available to fill jobs, that's helping more demand that's increasing checks per payroll, that kind of thing. So I would say, no, I'm sure that has had some impact. But overall, states like Florida have actually been quite positive. Efrain Rivera : Yes, Mark, it's just been dwarfed by the recovery that probably if we were in a steady state, you'd see more of that. But in the data, as Marty said, the recovery in hospitality and leisure has been I think plus in Florida. Mark Marcon : And so even during the weeks when things started heating up for them from a case load perspective, it didn't have a dent? Efrain Rivera : No, we didn't see it, no. Mark Marcon : Okay. Great. And then with regards to your recent products and technology launches, I mean, this has probably been one of the most active periods for you as it relates to it. I'm wondering when we go through the list, whether it's Paychex Pre-Check, the retention insights, pay benchmarking, can dashboard, so on and so forth, which ones are you the most excited about? Which ones are seeing the highest attach rates? And which ones are leading -- are yielding the most incremental revenue? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think Paychex Pre-Check will -- it's just a staggered approach as it's going out now, but I think something like that will have big efficiency gains for clients, which will help a lot on retention. We're not looking -- we're not charging additional cost for that, revenue for that, that's part of the service that a client opts in for. But when you hear that clients are trying to be more efficient, it's things like that, that are really going to help on the retention and I think the revenue per client, so what -- the kind of price and the ability we get from that. So we're very excited about that one. Also that it is tied to the technology. It's tied to smart speakers. We're the only company tied to all 3 major voice assistant platforms. This is just a whole new way for clients to be able to handle things with their employees to say, \"Hey, your paycheck is ready. Would you like to check it, your paystub?\" Or from an employer standpoint, that you get Alexa that's telling you, \"Hey, you have 3 things to do today,\" as an employer\" I mean these kind of things are really tying much better retention than anything. And the retention insights, for example, really just uses the artificial intelligence to a great deal. You can check not only pay, but you can look at -- we look at like 15, 20 different indicators that are in the payroll, in the system, in the software that will say, \"Here's your performance rating of this person. Here's -- their pay is below the national average based on [POS] and their pay is below the rest of the team that have this job category of your own company. Hey, watch out on the dashboard, this person may be likely to leave you.\" When clients start seeing that, it's not as much about the revenue directly from that software, it's from the retention of saying, \"I can't live without this,\" just like the mobile app has been like that for us. They have a five-star mobile app that employees don't want to leave because it's easy to use and they can do so many things themselves, it's great from a retention standpoint. So we're really excited about the level of speed that we're putting out software enhancements and the strength of being much more of a technology company and software company and that that's leading to retention. Mark Marcon : Great. I mean, given the recent introduction, could it possibly offset some of the headwinds you noted in terms of the fall when you're thinking about retention? Martin Mucci : Yes. It could. It certainly is going to help keep it up there. I think, as Efrain mentioned earlier, and Mark, you know so well, there's always -- there is a natural level of just turnover of businesses on the smaller to midsize. So it's not going to get up there. But we're very proud of hitting a record level of retention last year, and we expected that to come down some this year. But as Efrain said, we have a Mendoza line that we're kind of saying, \"Hey, this is where we ought to be able to hold it.\" Mark Marcon : Great. And then one last one. Just on the mid-market, it sounds like you're doing much better there, who are you sensing that you're doing better against? Would it be the big competitor that all know about? Is it regionals? Is it some of the more recently public companies? Where are you seeing some of the greatest takeaways? Martin Mucci : Yes, we're seeing it kind of across the board. So I think we're doing very well competitively. And we've also still in-house as well doing well against what is. The major competitor and some of the other that you know so well, I think we're doing very well against them, with the technology enhancements, the software enhancements that we've just mentioned, and the ability to be able to show all of that. I think sometimes people still think of us as a more of a service company, great service company, but not the technology. When we're able to show the technology enhancements that we've introduced in the last few years, we come up against other competitors, and we perform extremely well. And as Efrain mentioned, you know we're fully integrated, so we can provide everything on one solution, Flex, right from retirement to insurance, to HR and payroll. So it's not necessarily where you might go to a competitor that says, \"Hey, I'm going to pass you to somebody else to do the retirement or pass you to somebody else to do this. Not to mention over 650 HR specialists who are really have been there in the last couple of years, nobody else has a team like that in my opinion. So... Operator : We will take our final question from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Most of my questions have been answered. The one thing I wanted to ask though is, when we look at kind of the hiring environment, you've emphasized like your own efforts there as well as the struggles of your customers, are there things that Paychex can be doing incrementally to help with the hiring beyond? Clearly, there are a lot of tools that you're already and you've highlighted. But are there things that you can be or should be doing to help your customers even more in the area? And just would love to get your thoughts on that as a strategic opportunity. Martin Mucci : Absolutely. I mean I think many of the things that we've talked about have really helped clients. You can go right from a financial perspective, which is the employee retention tax credits, giving them dollars in their pocket to pay more for existing employees or to attract employees. So we go right at them to help them with their own financial situation. Then when you look at from the product standpoint, you have all of these things, benefit plans, retirement plans, HR guidance and support. Many companies, 25, 30 employees still don't really have the great HR support knowledge that they need to be able to, how do I re-attract. And one that I haven't even mentioned today, which is really important is we've had this partnership with Indeed. We have a very fully integrated partnership with Indeed, which is the largest -- the world's largest job posting system. And we actually -- a client can go out and post on Indeed, they actually get a credit because they're with Paychex with Indeed for the first couple of postings. They can go out on that job board, post that -- if someone applies for that job, they give their demographic information, obviously, in the application. If that's accepted, that comes over with no need to then put that into our system again. It transfers over through API. So we also think we've helped them by getting them in front of the biggest job posting system and making it easy for them to post the job through Flex, place it on Indeed, somebody applies, it comes back from Indeed, self-populates really if their person is hired into the payroll system and the HR system and everything is set. So we've made it easy as much as we can for clients to hire and then retain by giving them the benefits and so forth to keep that employee. So we're very proud of the Indeed partnership and what that does, not only gives them a little financial incentive and some discounts on their postings, but it really makes it easy for them to post. And these are companies even 5 employees to 50 that still struggle sometimes with where to post for a job. Martin Mucci : Ashley, if there's no more -- Efrain does have a statement that he wants to make before we close out. Efrain Rivera : Are there no more questions? Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Thanks. Final point to the shareholders on the call, I just wanted to mention that we recently filed supplemental proxy materials relating to our proposal on say-on-pay. Glass Lewis has recommended a FOR vote on the proposal, and we would appreciate your support. Should you be interested in engaging with us on the issue, please feel free to reach out prior to the shareholder meeting or after. Happy to chat with you about it. So with that, I will turn it back to Marty. Martin Mucci : Great. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast for this conference call, will be archived for approximately 90 days. Thank you for your participate in our first quarter press conference -- press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great rest of the week. Operator : Thank you. And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have an opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this call may be recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Martin Mucci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex. Martin Mucci : Thank you, Emil [ph], and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex\u2019s, Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. And this morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2021. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet. It will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start today with an update on the business highlights for the first quarter, and Efrain will review the financial results for the quarter and provide an update on fiscal '22. We will then open it up for your questions. Today we reported strong financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, as both Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance Revenues increased double digits year-over-year and adjusted diluted earnings per share increase 25%. We continued to have strong momentum from the first quarter with positive trends across the entire business.  Client bases across all major solutions have continued to grow. Sales performance for the second quarter was strong across the board, resulting in our highest year-over-year growth in new annualized revenue in over five years, and in fact a record high level of annualized revenue sold for the second quarter and the first half of the year.  The investments we've made in our technology, product, sales and digital marketing have positioned us well for success in today's environment. Our client retention remains near record levels. This is reflective of both the resilience of small businesses in the U.S. and the value provided by our unique blend of software solutions and HR expertise. Macroeconomic tailwinds persisted in resulting in strong growth in checks per payroll and increases in worksite employees in our HR outsourcing clients.  The tight labor market and war for talent has been very challenging for all businesses. In response, Paychex\u2019s ourselves have taken proactive steps, implementing incentives and programs to compete for talent and we've made significant progress in hiring over the past quarter and we\u2019re well prepared heading into the calendar year end and selling season. COVID 19 and its variance continue to pressure businesses of all sizes and we constantly enhance our robust set of COVID-19 related solutions. Most recently within 10 days of the legislation surrounding COVID-19 vaccination and testing, we introduced a digital solution that businesses can leverage to confidentially capture and store employee vaccination status and request testing results for the unvaccinated. To help our clients stay up-to-date on all federal and state regulatory changes, we continue to introduce new methods of communication to proactively keep them informed and educated through white papers, webinars, videos and our podcast series on the mark.  We closely monitor topics that may have a significant impact on our clients, such as vaccine management's, updated guidance on Employee Retention Tax Credit or EITC and the return of mask mandates in specific states. We remain a trusted resource to support small and mid-size businesses. The trends we saw accelerate during the pandemic continue, including the need for HR advice; the need to upgrade employee benefits and retirement solutions to attract and retain talent and the acceleration of digital technology solutions to support a distributed workforce, and tools to help businesses maximize available stimulus from the government.  We've seen the benefits of these trends and strong demand for our HR Solutions. Another business that is benefiting from strong demand is our retirement business, where we have reached 100,000 client milestone. As a leader in this space, we are uniquely positioned to help businesses meet the growing number of state mandates for retirement plans and provide a critical benefit offering to drive employee retention and satisfaction.  In fact, in January, we were one of the first to release a PEP plan or Pooled Employer Plan and 11 months later, not even a year later we now have over 10,000 PEP clients. The access to stimulus funding has been a powerful retention tool for Paychex. We're proud that we've been able to help clients obtain billions in Paychex Protection Program loans and approximately 90% of our clients have leveraged our award winning PPP forgiveness tool to gain some or all level of forgiveness for those loans, effectively transitioning the PPP loan into a grant. We\u2019ve also helped businesses gain access to over $6 billion in employee retention and paid leave tax credits. Returns for clients leveraging our ERTC service represent a significant amount for any business. Two of our most recent technology innovations focus on employee retention. Our retention insights offering use \u2013 our retention insights offering uses predictive analytics based on a few dozen unique data elements to help employers identify employees who may be more likely to consider leaving their organization. This is Paychex\u2019s first client facing predictive analytic and could not come at a better time given today's competitive labor market.  We also introduced a completely enhanced total compensation summary that can be used by employers to communicate the impact of their total pay and benefits packages for employees. These are just two examples of the powerful technology and use of information we're providing to help employers compete and retain talent.  We continue to enhance our technology solutions to deliver efficiency for our clients, their employees and Paychex through self-service and chat bots. Use of our cloud based applications continues to grow with double digit increases in both desktop and mobile devices. During our recent open enrollment period for our POE clients for example, 99% of our PEO worksite employees completed their open enrollment digitally, resulting in a 26% reduction in call volume.  Our continued emphasis on expanding the digital capabilities of Paychex Flex was validated by several recent awards. We were named by NelsonHall, a leading global analyst research firm, as a leader in their annual NEAT vendor evaluation report for human capital management. Paychex\u2019s placed in the leader quadrant of the next generation HCM Technology Report. This designation was based on our ability to deliver immediate client benefits and meet clients\u2019 future requirements.  In addition, Brandon Hall Group has just recognized Paychex Flex with two Excellence in Technology awards. Our ERTC service was recognized in the category of Best Advance in HR and Workforce Management Technology for Small and Mid-Sized Businesses, and Paychex Pre-Check was recognized in the category of Business Strategy and Technology Innovation. This is our ninth consecutive year we've been recognized for technology in this award program. The largest and longest running award program in the HCM space. Before closing I'd like to take a moment to discuss the recent change in executive leadership roles that took effect on December 1. I have assumed the role of Chairman of the Board and will continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer. Tom Golisano our Founder and prior Chairman will remain a Board Member and will continue to play a role in the governance and oversight of the company.  John Gibson, our Senior Vice President of service since 2013 has been promoted to the role of President and Chief Operating Officer. John has been an integral part of our executive team and has led the service and operations of all Paychex\u2019s businesses divisions, including HR Outsourcing, Payroll, Retirement and Insurance. There remains continuity leadership to drive Paychex\u2019s of the future and I'd like to thank Tom for his leadership and for his continued support as we move forward and wish John well in our future growth.  In summary, we are proud of our performance during the second quarter. We are well positioned with our set of innovative technology and service solutions for the selling season and to continue providing industry leading value to our clients.  I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results for the second quarter. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks Marty and good morning everyone. I'd like to remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and therefore involve some risks. In addition, I will periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures; refer to the customary disclosures.  So, let me start by providing key points for the quarter, follow-up with greater detail in certain areas and I\u2019ll finish with the review of our fiscal 2022 outlook.  Our second quarter results reflected strong internal execution and continued economic recovery. Both service revenue and total revenue increased 13% to $1.1 billion. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue increased 14% to $832 million, driven primarily by growth in client bases across our portfolio of solutions, higher revenue per client and improved employment levels.  Client based growth resulted from both strong sales performance and high levels of client retention. In particular, our HR Solutions Business continues to benefit from strong demand as businesses look for more HR support. PEO and Insurance solutions revenue increased 11% to $262 million. Our PEO has benefited from higher average worksite employees, state unemployment insurance revenue and health insurance attachment. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 5% for the quarter to $14 million. The impact of lower average interest rates and realized gains was partially offset by a 9% increase in average investment balances. Total expenses were up 6% to $668 million. The growth in expenses resulted from higher PEO direct insurance costs and increase in benefit cost to our employees and continued investment in our products, technology, sales and marketing.  Op income increased 24% to $440 million with an operating margin of 39.7%. Adjusted operating margin was also 39.7% in the second quarter compared with 36.1% for the prior year period, an expansion of 360 basis points. Our effective income tax rate was 24% compared to 22.1% for the same period last year. Both appear to reflect net discrete tax benefits related to stock based compensation payments.  Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 25% for the quarter to $330 million and $0.91 per share respectively. Year-to-date results, I\u2019ll touch on the highlights briefly here. This is for the six month period obviously ending November 30. Total service revenue and total revenue increased 50%, 14% respectively to $2.2 billion expenses, excluding one-time costs incurred during the prior year increase 5%. Op income and adjusted Op income were $883 million, increases of 38% and 32% respectively. Diluted earnings per share increased 37% to $1.83 per share, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 32% to $1.80 per share.  Let's talk about financial position. It remains strong with cash restricted cash and total corporate investments over $1.1 billion and total borrowings of approximately $800 million as of November 30. Cash flows from operations were $555 million during the first six months, an increase of 29% from the same period last year. Free cash flow generated was $459 million, up 21% year-over-year. The increases were driven by higher net income, partially offset by fluctuations in working capital. We have paid out quarterly dividends at $0.66 per share for a total of $476 million during the first six months. Our 12 months rolling return on equity was 43%.  Now I\u2019ll turn to guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2022. The outlook reflects the current macro environment, which saw improvement in the quarter. We\u2019ve taken that into account in the second quarter results, and our second quarter results actually exceeded expectations.  We have some conservatism given the macroeconomic uncertainty that prevails during the remainder of the year. We provided the following updated guidance as you saw. Management Solutions revenue is now expected to grow in the range of 10% to 11%. We\u2019ve previously guided to a growth of approximately 8%.  PEO and Insurance solutions is expected to grow in the range of 10% to 12%. We previously guided to grow in the range of 8% to 10%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be flat year-over-year. Total revenue expected to grow in the range of 10% to 11%. We previously guided to growth of approximately 8%. Adjusted op income is expected to be in the range of 39% to 40%, up from the previous guidance of 38% to 39%. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 44%, up from the previous guidance of approximately 43%. Other expense net is expected to be in the range of $15 million to $18 million. Our previous guidance was in the range of $23 million to $26 million, with the change due to certain non-operating income received during the second quarter.  Our effective income tax is still expected to be in the range of 24% to 25% and adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected now to grow in the range of 18% to 20%. We previously guided the growth of 12% to 14%.  Turning to the third quarter, we currently anticipate total revenue growth to be approximately 9%, and we are expecting an adjusted operating margin of approximately 42%, so note that in your models. PEO and Insurance solutions revenues for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 were impacted by the timing of notification of changes in state unemployment insurance rates. This creates compatibility issues for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022. It doesn't affect the whole year. You\u2019ll look at our investor presentation when we post it in a little bit, and we provided additional details so you can get the split of the quarters correct.  Of course everything that I just said is subject to our current assumptions, which could change given the current environment. We'll update you again on the third quarter call. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Marty. Martin Mucci : Thank you, Efrain. Emil [ph] we\u2019ll now open the call for questions or comments please. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Great! Thanks so much and congratulations on the results. Marty and Efrain, it looks like you delivered a 44.7% margin in the quarter. I think that's the highest on record and even going back to \u201807 when kind of the float income was half of what it was today. Can you maybe talk to just some of the structural changes? Marty you talked to kind of the Chat bots, things like that. But may be just can you help us frame, is there a new range of margins. Just any thoughts as to just the leverage in the model, because obviously just you're seeing outsized margin expansion and really still some headwinds around float income and things like that, so just wanted to start there if we could. Martin Mucci : Sure, and I\u2019ll let Efrain jump in to. I think there is really two parts to it. One is, we've been down some head count temporary as you know in a challenging hiring, but we really picked up a lot of hires in the second quarter due to some creative things we did. But I would say overall the bigger impact is that we have automated a lot of the service models. When you look at it and you think about chat bots, when someone comes on the web now to ask a question, over 60% of the questions are being answered in an automated fashion with a chat bot before they go to anyone live. Also as I mentioned in my comments, if you just think about the things we've done with Flex in our PEO offering, 99%, almost 100% of POE employee's, worksite employees handled open enrollment online digitally now, and that reduced calling in for questions and issues by over 25%.  So a lot of the things we're doing not only with the product, but with the service model themselves have reduced the number of calls that are coming in. Not only are the clients happier they are getting a faster answer and it's being done the way they want to receive it, which is either automatically or through chat, etc., but also we're saving expense and time and allowing our specialists to handle more value added calls for the client, so these are a wider range.  You know I think there's always a little bit wider range and you know that's our DNA, is to kind of drive margin as best we can. I would say a little is temporary, but most of it is the things that we've been doing year-after-year. Efrain Rivera : Yeah, there's no \u2013 to add there Kevin. I mean I\u2019ll just say that you know this very well and I think many of the analysts that cover us. We have evolved significantly from a technology standpoint. We have evolved significantly in terms of our digital capabilities and the model shows it, the margin show it. We will put up our margins against anyone in the business, because to Marty's point, its durable, its sustainable and its technology based. Kevin McVeigh : No, I get that. And just a follow up on that and I'll get back in the queue, because the numbers kind of speak for themselves. But is that the same level of success on the front end too in terms of the implementation. Like is there any way to think about when you are implementing a client for the first time, how much of that is fully digitalized as opposed to more a human component too. Is that too abstract? Martin Mucci : No, I know. What your saying is exactly we're heading. There's more and more clients that can self-onboard themselves. I'd say we're still more \u2013 we are newer into that process, but that is happening, not only because it's good for our expenses, it's really good for the client, the client want to self-onboard. SurePayroll division has been doing this for some time and Flex is continuing to grow into that. So if it's particularly a smaller clients, they want to start onboarding themselves, there's a couple benefits. Not only does it reduces costs, it allows the client to on-board themselves at their pace and it also really, it creates a lot fewer errors and interactions with the service team, because the client is doing it at their own pace and when they want to do it and how they want to do it. And the last thing is that it frankly many times is a better sale if you're buying online digitally and then you start self-onboarding yourself and you might need help, but if you don't, you complete that, it's better than multiple sales people and service people talking to you to implement you. So we're definitely headed \u2013 we're definitely down that path, more on this SurePayroll side, but Flex is increasing as well. Kevin McVeigh : Thank you, and again congrats on the promotions. Martin Mucci : Thanks Kevin. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Bryan Bergin : Hi! Good morning and happy holidays! I wanted to start with retention. Can you just talk about what you're seeing there? It sounds like its still record, but you did expect some moderation in the year. So any change on that front and can you talk about some of the underlying factors you would typically see that driver tensions as it relates to out of business closures or normal clients switching behavior. And just also beyond 2Q, if you can help us a little bit into the December month as well? Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think so far Q2 was still near record levels. It wasn't quite as high as the record that we saw in Q1, but it's very close to that. I really still think as I said last quarter that we will kind of even out at some place better than we were pre pandemic and I think a number of things that are helping that, there is fewer out of business, but there is also just the value of the product. What we're seeing is the value. You know we are not seeing as many leaving for price value kind of category, because they are seeing the value of the product, especially in a time of COVID, with all the value we're bringing them from the product side, from the technology, handling a distributed workforce, with all of the mobile apps that we have and ability. And now the retention tools that we're giving them and the Paychex Pre-Check, where we are allowing the employees to review and approve kind of their own pay before he even gets processed.  All these things we\u2019re getting back from clients are adding value and that is doing exactly what we hoped, which is not only adding value to the client, but improving retention. So we're near record levels in Q2. Don't see anything changing at this point in December. Of course December-January is really where we'll see the number for year end, but right at this point we expect things to even out certainly better than pre pandemic levels. Bryan Bergin : Okay, that\u2019s good to hear. And then the \u2013 you know I understand the conservatism in the outlook given everything that's going on with a omicron. Any \u2013 have you seen an actual impact in any sales activity or pipeline yet or was it just conservatism making sure you may see some actual impact? Efrain Rivera : I think we're always trying to be conservative, especially in an environment like this, like you said, but right now record levels of par annualized revenue we're seeing and growth in the first half of the year and in the second quarter. It still seems strong, but selling season is really when we know how that'll be. But right now really all areas, you know retirement, HR Solutions, mid-sized business, you know our mid-market business and virtual sales, digital sales, all going strong. Bryan Bergin : Okay, thank you. Do well. Martin Mucci : Okay. Thanks Mike. Operator : Our next comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : Hi! Good morning. I appreciate you taking my questions. I guess my first one is kind of sticking with the technology theme from the responses to the first couple of questions. Just as it relates to kind of relates to kind of paying for that kind of talent, my sense is that you know engineering, software, building talent is getting more and more expensive; it has for some time. Just wondering how you think about that, both from an expense perspective, but also a labor supply perspective as you move forward here through the rest of the year and beyond. Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think you know one thing we've got a very tenured team and Mike Gioja and the team has done just a gear job. You know Mike\u2019s been in charge of that for over 10 years now and has just done a great job with that team and you know and I think one of the things, yes, the costs go up and you have to compete in this market and I think we've done that very effectively.  We also make it a great place for them to work. They can all \u2013 they all can work from home, yet they also have great office space that's available to them to come in, and they meet you know regularly, but they're all working from home. They are also working on some of the latest technology and digital services and that adds a lot of retention as well.  Years ago, you know 10-plus, 15 years ago you know where there was always an issue; are we working with the latest technology? Well you know we\u2019ve blown well past that. We're a leader from an innovative product development, not only the products that we have, but the way we develop them and the infrastructure and architecture that we use. And so I think that is very attractive to candidates and attracted to the employees to stay here. So we're very proud of the tenure we have and I think we pay very competitively and that's why we've had good retention. Andrew Nicholas : That's helpful. Thank you. And then just for my follow-up, a different topic. Just on the PEO insurance business, could you maybe break down the PEO performance versus insurance performance in the quarter. I think your expectation last time we spoke was that insurance was going to be a bit slower this year. Just wondering if that\u2019s played itself out to this point and if second quarter helps speak to that any further. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Yeah, thanks Andrew, fair question. So when you look at the PEO business versus the Insurance business, the Insurance business moderated the overall growth of PEO and Insurance. PEO was solid double digits growing nicely; good client ads, good client wins. Insurance is a tale of two cities. The health and benefit side grew upper single digits and but where comp still remains a really tough compare, because that market continues to be soft.  I probably am going on four or five years of talking about softness in workers comp, but it is good to say it at least has moderated to the point where we were flat year-over-year, but increasingly it\u2019s a smaller and smaller part of the business, but it hasn't bounced back yet.  So PEO are doing very well. I\u2019d say health and benefits on the insurance side are doing well. Workers comp kind of creating a situation that moderates the overall amount. Hopefully as we get into next year that will start to turn around. But I've said that before and been wrong before, so don't take it to the bank. Thanks. Andrew Nicholas : Alright, thank you. Happy Holidays! Efrain Rivera : Thanks Andrew. You too. Operator : We'll go next to Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson. Eugene Simuni : Thank you very much. Good morning! I wanted to ask first about Management Solutions. Very impressive performance this quarter, outperforming I think everybody\u2019s, including your expectations. You listed out a number of drivers that are behind that outperformance. Can you give us a little bit of color of which of these drivers are more one time, kind of temporary in nature in which can be sustained as we're moving forward? Efrain Rivera : Let me start and then a maybe Marty can add some further color. So, if you look at Management Solutions and you kind of apply, kind of a broad umbrella of what's in that revenue stream, you really have three important components. As many of you know, you've got HCM solutions that are roughly about, a little bit under half of that revenue stream, but then I would say there's two other parts that we don't talk about as much, but increasingly have become very, very important, which are the combination of retirement services and also what we would call ASR, HR Outsourcing; this not PEO. So if you look at that, those two in comparison to HCM, they are now almost 50% of what HCM is and they are growing at rates that are faster than HCM. Now HCM had a very strong quarter; it's not that it didn\u2019t. It's just that retirement services and HR Outsourcing had even stronger, even stronger quarters.  Now those are not one-time things. There's demand in the environment for both retirement services. I think Marty mentioned PEP plans, etc. and our success there, pretty clear we are leading the market in terms of selling of that product. If you look at, if you trace that back, we didn't release it, but you trace that back to our sales. Sales have been very strong and on the HR Outsourcing area, solution side, that's been very strong too. Both of those are driven by unique factors in the Market HR, because of the uncertainty the environment, the demand, the value proposition has never been higher and as a consequence demand is very strong. And on the retirement side, there are increasing amounts of states that are mandating retirement plans for employees that have benefited our business and that continues to grow strongly. So what have I just said? I've said that a lot of the demand of forces within Management Solutions obviously have benefited from a pandemic rebounded, but if I isolate the HR Outsourcing and retirement services, those are responding to other forces in the economy that we think are pretty durable.  So long story short, there isn\u2019t a lot of one-time in there. There are some things. The rebound certainly is part of it, but there are also structural demands; structural factors that are driving demand higher. Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think that's very true, and as Efrain went through those, every product is strong. We didn't necessarily expect retirement to be as strong as it is, and as I mentioned our PEP product, we're one of the first to come out with the PEP product, the pooled Employer Plan back in just January of this year, so not even a year later we are 10,000 clients.  We have sold that extremely well and when you look across the board, Efrain mention between time and attendance, but HR Solutions you know in a COVID environment is so critically important and the technology that we've been reduced on the mobile apps, so the ability to really handle distributed workforces, to be able to track vaccinations, and those who were unvaccinated, all these things are part of a digital experience that clients are really seeing. So I think most of it is sustainable growth that we're seeing.  Even the macro that you're seeing, more checks and so forth should be sustainable unless there's a drop off because of the very in in the next year, but we don't see that and still there\u2019s room to grow. You know there\u2019s a lot of people that are still not employed and we expect that could pick up next in the first part of half of the next calendar year. Eugene Simuni : Got it, got it. Thank you. And then for my follow-up I wanted to quickly ask about inflation impact, COVID inflation being the word of the day, could you just remind us quickly of the kind of puts and takes of the high inflation for your own business. Efrain Rivera : So, you know inflation in general is a net positive, hard to say it that way, but what it does is because of the segment of the market that we're in, we have relatively more pricing power than if you work in the enterprise space, although I suspect they'll have more and more pricing power. So it gives us, in terms of our model, a measure of ability to price maybe a little bit higher than we have experienced in previous years, to the extent that inflation also drives interest rates higher that also has a benefit on to the business.  So obviously there is a balance there in terms of, if interest rates and inflation surged too high, could have a dampening effect on economic growth, but assuming it's under some reasonable level, it's going to be a net positive for the business. Eugene Simuni : Got it. Thank you. Well, happy holidays guys! Martin Mucci : Thank you. Same to you. Operator : We'll go next to Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Hi guys! Congrats on the quarter here! I want to break down kind of my favorite topic looking at the revenue per client. I know that's been going higher just thinking about you know the drivers specifically on that. And then price realization, I know that's almost a separate thing what you guys are doing on that front. Martin Mucci : I'll start and then let Efrain jump in. I think, one, yeah I think we're just selling Bryan more services. The revenue per client has really been helpful when you think about things like we've talked about time and attendance and some of the other ERTC, things that are driving the revenue and even really doing much stronger, even though the client growth is solid as well. We are really seeing more revenue because of more adoption of different services that the client is taking.  From a price standpoint, I think we're feeling like we still have good price realization, you know and I don't think there's some pressure on it, but as Efrain mentioned in this inflationary kind of time frame think it's \u2013 one probably is difficult to get it as it was and also while it's still very competitive in the market. But also the value that we're bringing, I think well, it's just not challenged as much given how much we've been able to do.  If you just type something like Employee Retention Tax Credit, you know we're bringing so much to our client at a relatively low cost that they're benefiting a lot. I think at that point to start, they see more and more value that we bring through COVID that has helped us get even better price realization. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Yeah, so Bryan to your point, I think that we've had very, very good average revenue price per client, especially on our HCM clients, it's been very positive and our price realization in this environment when you triangulate the retention, plus the extra, the additional value added in terms of services sold we we've been able to do very, very well.  One thing we haven't talked about, which I don't want to \u2013 you know I don't want to forget in this process. One of the strengths of our model is that we are really very, very quick, and Marty mentioned this earlier. We are very, very agile in terms of responding to two new opportunities that come up as a result of changes in legislation.  So we mentioned that there's this service we call Employee Retention Tax Credit. We have, I think throughout the pandemic shown agility in terms of responding very quickly and creating value added products and services for our clients. That\u2019s helped both to raise our average revenue per client, also helped us to justify the price realization that we\u2019ve done. Marty said, we\u2019ve been losing very few clients to, because the dissatisfaction with value and price and its part because we keep raising the value of what we're providing to clients and they've responded very well. Bryan Keane : Got it and then at the success you guys are having in the mid-market, is there something driving that, that difference or is there a competitive thing going on there? Martin Mucci : I think Bryan you know it's really. We've got a very, much more tenured sales force now great leadership that's been driving that now for a few years. I think the last year or so we ran into a great presentations, but people not making decisions, and I think we're now going back at those and we're winning a lot of these deals against competitors. Just won a big one yesterday and in really doing well against the competitors that are out there. I think because of the product work that's been done, and the technology that is really fitting exactly what they need at the moment.  As Efrain said, the agility to be able to turn around things like employee retention insights. The fact that we give them new compensation summaries for their clients or for their employees, whatever they have needed. We are feeling like we're kind of a step ahead and in the mid-market in particular they're really feeling the pinch and retention and attraction of new employees, and we're able to do that, and remember we talked about it on another call.  This partnership we have with Indeed, where you are connected digitally through Paychex Flex to Indeed the world's largest job posting site, you get a credit on Indeed, Indeed, you can post the job electronically, digitally then if they respond to the post, it goes right into the system, if you hire them, everything is paperless, these are all things that mid-market clients in particular right now need and we've been ahead of it and really hats off to the product management and development teams. I mean we have just been a step ahead of everything they need. So I think that is real and then the power of the sales team really has come through. Efrain Rivera : The other thing I\u2019d add Bryan is that you know before in previous years we talked a lot about client sizes trending down in terms of clients sold. You know in the last year what we\u2019ve seen in the clients sizes, especially in our mid-market business are trending up, not down, and I think that part of it is, there \u2013 in this environment the ability to bundle the right level of value added services to a mid-market client is valued very highly and not all of the competition can do that, because not all of the competition has an integrated platform, plus world class service and I think that that's a winning proposition in the marketplace right now. Bryan Keane : Got it. Alright guys, have a great and safe holiday. Martin Mucci : Thanks Bryan. You too. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : Hey! Thanks guys. Happy Holidays! Martin Mucci : Thank you. Jason Kupferberg : Thank you, thank you. So as we entered fiscal \u201922, I think the expectation you guys had was for net client base growth to return to kind of the more normalized historical levels of 1% to 3%. But based on how things have gone through the first half of the year, do you think that figure could come in higher and to the extent that it does, would you attribute it more to the gross client ads or to the retention outperformance? Efrain Rivera : So yeah, I think we\u2019re certainly trending at the high end of that range. We\u2019ll see whether we actually beat the high end Jason. I think the second part of that is that, you know it's really balanced performance. I'd say last year, when I reflect back, you know I've been \u2013 in this quarter last year I think management solutions was up 1% and PEO and insurance was up about 3% or 4%. We were pleasantly surprised that actually we had started to see a return, a quick return to revenue growth. But it really was fueled an important measure by retention, which as Marty mentioned earlier was at record levels. We still continue to have very good retention, that's been great, but our sales performance has been really strong this year. So a combination of both of those is really what's driving. I would say it helps a little bit more towards the sales side rather than the retention side, but both have been strong Efrain Rivera : Absolutely! Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Maybe just picking up on the topic of sales since you are kind of entering the key selling season here, so just in light of the new variant, is that having any bearing on your sales strategy here, virtual versus in-person over the next couple of months? A - Martin Mucci : You know really Jason, it's not. I mean we've been very successful selling you know from virtually and I think that we\u2019ll continue they have the option if the client and the rep agree you know to get together. More of them are doing that, and I think even with the variant, I think they're still \u2013 you know they are still doing that. But so many of the presentations now, particularly in the midmarket you know can be done virtually and really I think we\u2019ve really fine-tuned that through this time.  And the sales engineering team, and so they\u2019ve just done a great job in kind of building out sandboxes and different examples for a client that are very personalized so the client could say, \u2018this is what you're going to get, this is how you work through it, and frankly it's probably easier to do it virtually and digitally than it is in front of the client you know, because they can all see it right in front of them and they can take them through it. So yeah, I don't think it will affect us.  We're well staffed, we're you know great products;, everything's really moving very well, so it feels very strong right now, but we'll know at the end of selling season, but we feel pretty good right now with the momentum. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, but I appreciate the comments guys. Thanks again. Operator : We'll go next to James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Thanks very much. I wanted to follow-up quickly on retention in sites. You mentioned that is the key tool for you and your customers. Is the retention stability partly a function of retention in sites integration right now and to the Flex platform generally, and can you give some idea on client adoption of that product to-date? A - Martin Mucci : Yeah James, it's pretty early but we're getting a lot of great feedback from clients, because everyone's looking for that kind of information and I mean we certainly use the same kind of thing and have for some time internally and now it\u2019s much more built for mid-market and small clients to be able to use. It using a number of factors just to look at what \u2013 which employees do you think are most likely to leave; that gives them some insight into that and it can help them with the retention.  So it's pretty early in the adoption, I guess early innings of this thing I would say, but it's really been very well accepted and I think they feel like it's an easy way to use Flex to get that insight. So I would say it's still early, but great feedback with what we're doing from a predictive analytic basis. James Faucette : Great! And then just a quick macro question from me. You know one of the big, one of the big lingering uncertainties in the economy overall right now is just labor force participation and being able to fulfill and fill openings. Can you give a little view into what you are seeing from that perspective? Are you seeing people come back to labor force? Are there any particular areas or industries that are responding better than others or there are industries that aren't responding; just some macro insight there just as we try to get a grasp on kind of what's happening generally? A - Martin Mucci : Yeah, sure. You know we obviously from our small business index and that really looks at the clients of ours that are under 50 employees. You know we're seeing continued growth, job growth for six months in a row now, so the job growth is good. Now we're still as you know you know what I round to 61% participation rate I think, which is down a couple of percentage points from pre pandemic. We're still short around 4 million jobs from pre pandemic, 1.5 million of those are leisure and hospitality.  So I would say the ones that are still struggling the most are the restaurants and you probably know everyone kind of sees that anecdotally from cut back hours or even you know closed a few more days than they normally would. I think that's where still the biggest struggle has been and it's a combination of you know the pay which has gone up dramatically. We're seeing average part time pay for our client base. Part time pay per hour is $19.62 last month. It's an amazing thing when you think two years ago everybody was arguing about getting to 15.  So it is more costly, the supplies are more costly as well, but I think from an employment perspective, that's probably the one that is suffering the most. But I do think that as things change now and some of the stimulus money dries up, the unemployment has changed of course back toward more normal levels, but the child tax credit you know may end up going away as well, it's been arguments.  You know you got to pay your tuition payments now. They've been deferred many of them, rents. I think you're going to see more people come back in the first and second quarter would be our guess based on what we're hearing from clients. So they\u2019ve seen growth, but there's still a lot of people that are still sitting on the sidelines. But I think you know depending on what the market does and of course just kind of overall cash balances, as things are all coming together we expect more people to be hired in the next six months as that continues to pick up. James Faucette : That\u2019s great color. Thanks a lot Marty; thanks. A - Martin Mucci : Thanks James. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Hey! Good morning Marty and Efrain. Efrain, I wanted to go back to a little bit of a comment you made when you were answering a question on inflation and just pricing. I know usually you change pricing around May and I'm wondering what\u2019s the current environment. Are you still with the same strategy or is there an opportunity to change a timing and maybe get two price increases, two follow-ons that add up to a larger price increase? A - Efrain Rivera : Yeah, that's a good question. So I\u2019d say two things : One is, I\u2019ll make a statement of philosophy about what the company does and then answer the question. The first thing is that I think you're right Kartik, typically in the late spring. We actually used to broadcast that, which I was not a big fan of. But we typically would look at it in late spring and raise it. I would say in the pandemic we really have adopted a little bit more flexible timing, so we don't necessarily say we're going to do it in April - May or we're going to do it in June/July and we look at what the circumstances are and then decide when it's right to plug in a price increase, so that's the first part.  I think that you know from our perspective we think it\u2019s important to be fair to customers. I think we're guided by that thought. The fact that we can take two or even more price increases does not determine whether we will, because in the end we value our relationship with clients. Our job is to create value that supports a price increase and much of what Marty has been saying during this call I think is an indication all of that. So we'll take a look in the spring, figure out what makes sense. We certainly don't want to create a situation where clients perceive that they are not getting the value for what we're charging. On the other hand we task ourselves with creating greater and greater value per client, so that when we do passive increase along, they don't complain about it and generally that's what occurs. Kartik Mehta : And then Marty, I think that \u2013 this is a difficult question, but maybe you have some insight. You talked a little bit about employees coming back to the workforce in the next six months. If you look at your client base, is there a way to tell maybe how many openings there really all are and if people do come back, what that could mean to your kind of pays per check? Martin Mucci : Interesting! I think we could tell with some of them, because you know of course they use our products for posting jobs and so forth and we can see and we actually give them you know kind of a notice that says, \u201cHey! You know if you just let someone \u2013 if you've just reducing an employee, would you like to post this? Would you like to do something with it?\u201d I don't have that number right in front of me Kartik, but I think we continue to try to watch that to see and we know the average employees. I think definitely we have some sense that it can obviously continue to benefit us from where it is.  We're seeing the tailwind of the economy and that our employees, that our clients are hiring and as Efrain said you know, that we've seen the average size of the clients grow as well. So we still think there's some room to grow there and that would obviously give us continued tailwind. Efrain Rivera : And I\u2019d say Kartik, we obviously to put a plan together as we get into the spring of next year we\u2019ll create a more detailed estimate of what we think. It will be really important to see where we end up in the January - February time frame. You know last year and it seems like many, many, years ago, there was an outbreak. There was the post-thanksgiving winter outbreak like we're having now in New York and it did have a little bit of impact. We're not seeing that right now, but we'll have to get through the next month, month and a half, to get a better sense of where we're at. A - Martin Mucci : Yeah, the other thing with that is even if we knew, because we have some sense of how many openings there are, you don't know if that restaurant or that business is going to back fill them or not. They may have become more efficient. We certainly have seen our clients become more efficient during this period and realize that they could do without this employer or that one and not hire back after an extended period of time and not been able to get somebody. So it's a little hard to predict, but we still think there's certainly room for that to grow. Kartik Mehta : Well, thank you both of you. I really appreciate it. A - Martin Mucci : Okay Kartik, thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Mark Marcon with Baird. Mark Marcon : Hey! Good morning and happy holidays Marty and Efrain and Marty and John, congratulations on the promotions. I have several questions. On the Paychex pre-check, what sort of adaption are you getting and how much is that actually helping in terms of the accuracy of the payrolls? A - Martin Mucci : Yeah, its early innings for pre-check, but we're getting very good feedback and that it's very easy for them to check that the accuracy that from a client perspective they feel the accuracy is helping them, you know from the standpoint that their employees aren\u2019t going to complain that something they \u2013 they got something that they didn't expect in the paycheck. That they got a chance to see their hours, that they got a chance to approve those or be able to say from a digital standpoint, \u201cHey! I disagree with this, and I have a question that the employer can take care of.\u201d  So it's early. Mark, I'd give you a better sense probably in a quarter or two, but really good feedback on the early clients that we've seen from that standpoint. Mark Marcon : Right. And what are you seeing in terms of on-demand payroll and the demand for that at the small end? A - Martin Mucci : Yeah, you know it's been steady, but still I'd say pretty light. You know there's certain clients, the more the hourly and restaurants, things like that, and they are still a little bit slow to adopt it. I think we can, we still got a lot of opportunity, really to advance that as more people get used to it and there's more demand for it. I think clients are a little concerned sometimes about offering it, because we are not sure if that's going to have a cashful impact, which it doesn't, and then the employees are not aware of it and so they don't ask for it.  I think you're going to see over the next, it'll take I think the next couple of years, but I think they'll be a very big demand for that as you know employees just say, \u2018hey, look I want to get paid today\u2019 and I think you'll see a resurgence of more gig economy kind of thing where I'm working two or three jobs, but they're all I want the money now because it's eight hours here in eight hours there.  So I'd say still pretty light success for those who do it, they like it, and we're trying to find new ways to build that out and grow that business, because we think it's really going to be a big demand in the future. Mark Marcon : Great! And then in terms of the gross sales, you mentioned how strong things are. Obviously you're in the middle of the key selling season, but I'm wondering in terms of what you've seen thus far this season, how would you describe it between the micro versus the small, versus you know you're more medium sized clients and what are you seeing in terms of the differences between established versus brand new business formations? Martin Mucci : Yeah, I mean really strong at all sizes. I would say, right from SurePayroll size, very strong growth and from sure strong growth on the Flex side from small to mid-size, and the mid-market really we're doing very well. This is one of the best years we've had in years and I talked a little bit about that. Some of that is clients that got presented to last year that had really we are ready to decide. But I just think the overall package as Efrain said, we are really the only, one of the only maybe a two major competitors of the bunch that can offer everything in an integrated fashion with the latest technology. So you can buy parts from other competitors, but you're going to have to connect the third parties. We can do that too, but if you want it all in one place and the HR expertise to back it up, with over 650 HR experts, which people really like to have as a back-up now, that's what they are seeing and is very strong. So we're seeing it across the board, sorry what was the second part of that, it was all the different. Mark Marcon : The established versus the brand new businesses, I mean what you were just saying in terms of like being the only one of two that can offer everything, are you seeing an increased level of wins with companies coming back to you from some of the newer competitors that are out there. Martin Mucci : We're seeing some, yes, in the mid-market and we're winning more on the up front. I would say it's stronger on the up front like going head-to-head today, than necessarily winning them back, but we're getting some of those as well. And I think and we are still seeing a strong growth and as you know, new business starts. It's still, I think it's up year-to-date maybe 30% to 40%. So we are still getting a very small on the low end, there is more typically on the very low end as you know, but we're still seeing a lot of start-up businesses, and I think it's just part of the economy right now. Mark Marcon : That's great. Thank you. Congrats! Martin Mucci : Okay, thanks. Operator : We'll go next to with Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys! Its Andrew on for Tien-tsin. I just wanted to ask you a question \u2013 hello! I just wanted to ask a question. I know about a year ago, in the earlier part of this calendar year, we were talking about ASO out selling to PEO and I know last quarter we talked about PEO coming back strong and into this quarter. So I just wanted to ask how that\u2019s coping today and just more high level, how the margin differ across those two solutions? Martin Mucci : Yeah, first I'd say that the sales Andrew have evened out pretty good. I mean we're having strong ASO and PEO sales. I think you know PEO has come on very strong, particularly in those, the great markets that we're in; hats off to the sales and service teams there. We are having not only good growth there, but also ASO. So it was really we're having good strong growth in both markets and I think it just shows the demand for HR Solutions that not only from a digital solution, but also with the HR Expertise that we can bring from both sides and the need for full benefits.  One of the things that we just did a survey and it comes out very strong is, the need \u2013 if you're going to attract and retain employees, you got to really look out for their wellbeing and that\u2019s from a financial standpoint, that's from benefits, retirement included, they're really looking for that overall perspective. I\u2019ll let Efrain, if Efrain you want to. Efrain Rivera : Yeah, you know with respect to the question on margins, the margins on PEO are going to be lower, not because the core offering has lower margins, but because of the absence \u2013 I\u2019m sorry the inclusion of pass through revenues on insurance. So to Marty's point when you sell the full benefit, you've got insurances attached. Those carry lower costs, because a portion of them are pass-through. So the margin is lower on the PEO or the revenue can be higher. Undefined Analyst : Got it! Thank you and I just had one follow-up. I know you talked a lot about the retention tools you guys are offering to customers, but just on the hiring side, what are some of the ways that Paychex can help SMBs with their actual hiring? I recall last quarter you talked about the partnership with Indeed. I was just curious also if we could hear how that's trending. Martin Mucci : Yeah, its continuing to trend well. It's a hot market as everyone knows to hire, it's very difficult. And I think that that partnership of being able to do it, you know to partner with Indeed who as I said is so many job postings, they are the largest in the world I think right now from a job posting site. To have that digitally connect, to also have to deal with them where they get some credits with Indeed to be able to post is all very strong, and then I think that that also attracts people. Then the full benefit, the full HR Solution that I just said, you know the benefits of retirement and all of the other benefits, insurance benefits, this is really attracting more people and retaining the client. So that is all things that we can offer, not only from a full solution set, but from a technology standpoint that really attracts a generation that is out there deciding where they want to work today. You know they want things on their mobile app. The Paychex Flex mobile app is full featured. You can have your retirement, your insurance, your paystub, you have now Paychex. You know you are working for somebody who you feel like not only has full benefits, but they are a leader in technology when you use our product. So that's how we're helping our clients, particularly I guess I\u2019d say in the mid-market to succeed and that drives a lot of value for them and for us. Unidentified Analyst : Great! Thank you, and have a happy holiday and New Year's Eve. Bye! Martin Mucci : Great! Thank you, Andrew. Bye-bye! Same to you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Peter Christiansen from Citi. Peter Christiansen : Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Happy Holidays! Martin Mucci : Yeah thanks. Peter Christiansen : Nice results. A couple of questions here. Efrain you did mention new business formation continues to be strong. Certainly have been driving that from the chats and that's been what, 50% typically of new sales. But I was just wondering if you could talk about the opportunity or maybe the trend that you're seeing from you know the sales file or maybe from some of the regional, perhaps less sophisticated players out there. How are some of the trends there behaving as regards to new sales?  And then my follow up would be, you talked for a number of quarters since the pandemic; ASO, HRO has been gaining, it's been really strong. Has that mix-shift helped them? To what degree is that mix shift helping the margin I guess is my follow up. Thank you. Martin Mucci : I\u2019ll start it out with some of the regional players. We are net - certainly net adding from a regional player perspective, meaning selling versus losing. I think many of the regional players are struggling in this environment to provide as many \u2013 as much value through COVID. The speed at which regulations are changing and demands on small and mid-size businesses for vaccination policy, the mandate, what's the latest, you know you're going to get that from someone like us and in fact many smaller players try to copy our stuff off the web.  We have a very comprehensive website for marketing that puts all the information on by-state telling you what you have to do, where you have to do it and then here's the products that will help you with that from a technology and a service standpoint. So I think it's really been more difficult on the regional players today that just don't have the breadth of service knowledge or compliance people to be able to keep up with us. We have over 200 compliance experts that follow every single thing that's happening and that may happen, so that we can be as agile as Efrain mentioned earlier on creating these products almost as soon as the issues come out.  So very strong from a regional competitor standpoint on the net ads that we've seen year-to-date. You want to take the\u2026? Efrain Rivera : Yeah, and Peter on the margin part, you know one of the things that I think you've seen in the model certainly over the last three, four quarters or so is that when you have growth in revenue, you don't have attendant costs associated with it typically, and so you scale mostly and drop a lot to the bottom line. I think that's particularly true on management solutions where that's a higher margin \u2013 that's the higher margin portion of the revenue and so when ASOs is growing at the rate that it's growing, because of the way that our business model works, a lot of that ends up dropping to the bottom line. So it \u2013 all of the mix shift in terms of the way the business has been growing has been helpful to margins. Peter Christiansen : Very helpful gentleman. Happy Holidays! Martin Mucci : Thank you. Same to you. Efrain Rivera : Take care. Martin Mucci : Are there any other questions? Operator : We\u2019ll take our final question from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Martin Mucci : Okay, thank you. Scott Wurtzel : Thanks! Hey guys, this is Scott on for Darrin. Just first one, within our Management Solutions you guys called out, one of the drivers being improved marketing conditions for retirement services, I was just wondering if you could give a little more color on that? Martin Mucci : Yeah, I think what's happening there is there's a lot of mandates now that are coming out by state. You know we still haven't seen necessarily the federal mandate, but that's been discussed a lot, but a lot of states, California in particular, New York, some others are coming out saying that you know businesses \u2013 in some cases all sizes have to offer a retirement plan of some sort to their employees.  So there is going to be some \u2013 there's some mandates there that will have penalties that are starting to be enacted. Some are in place already and in California I think coming up in June. So there's a lot of attraction there to people not only looking at it from that standpoint, but also just from a hiring standpoint and full benefits.  There's a lot of interest as I mentioned in having a full suite of benefits for the wellbeing of the employees that\u2019s helping retain them and attract them in a difficult market. So it's retirement, it's insurance, it's what's your work from home policy, your hybrid policy of working in office and home. It\u2019s all those things kind of combined, it\u2019s not just compensation.  So that's really picked up and we\u2019ve had, continued to have a very strong retirement sales and the fact that we offer a multitude of products and we just went over 100,000 clients I mentioned earlier. It's a great milestone. We're still Number 1 in new 401-K plans that are offered and I think between our PEP plan and our regular 401-K plans and that raised very strong very strong conditions in the market and great success from our selling team, selling them and servicing them. Scott Wurtzel : Great! And then just one follow-up. As we think about investments in the business going forward, I know over the course of pandemic you've got to investing a lot on the digital and the self-service side of things. Just maybe as we hopefully approach more of a normalized environment, could you give a little more color on where you may be employing some investment dollars going forward? Martin Mucci : Yeah sure, it will continue certainly on the marketing side as well to get \u2013 the leads are coming in from a digital standpoint. We've been very successful in the work that our marketing team and leadership have done. We expect that to continue. That is accelerated through COVID and how people are buying, but also you'll continue to see it in the way we sell from a digital standpoint and the way we onboard as well.  You're going to see that, the self-service we talk about, that's going to be continued, because this is the way clients deal. They want to go as no surprise, they want to go online, they want to see your product, test your product, price your product and even start implementing it themselves, and be able to do that with a world class innovative product and mobile experience, and that's what we've got. So you'll see our digital investments continue in that standpoint. We've seen a lot of success from the investment we put out so far and that's going to continue. Scott Wurtzel : Great! Thanks guys. Happy Holidays! Martin Mucci : Thank you. Same to you. [End of Q&A]: Operator : There are no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Martin Mucci : Alright, thank you. At this point we will close the call.

Later, you\u2019ll have an opportunity to ask questions during the question-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this call may be recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Martin Mucci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex. Martin Mucci : Thank you, Katie, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex third quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings release. Joining me today, of course, is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. And this morning, before the market opens \u2013 financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2022. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about 90 days. I will start today's call with an update on our business highlights for the third quarter, and Efrain will review our financial results for the quarter and provide an update on fiscal 2022 \u2013 fiscal 2022, and then we'll open it up for your questions or comments. Strong results for the first half of the year continued in the third quarter as both management solutions and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenues increased by double-digit percentages year-over-year and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20%. We continue to see positive trends in our key indicators and strong momentum across all our lines of business, driven by a combination of solid internal execution and a market-leading suite of innovative solutions uniquely designed to address today's HR challenges. This momentum carried through calendar year-end and selling season, resulting in record sales performance and near-record level retention. Our value proposition continues to resonate in the market, particularly in this challenging environment and our sales results were broad based with double digit growth in new annualized revenue across all lines of business, HR outsourcing, retirement, payroll and insurance. We continue to improve our traction in the mid-market space, which has benefited from the investments we've made in our technology and product suite. Our client retention continues to surpass our expectations and remains near our record levels of the prior year, well ahead of the pre-pandemic levels. Our revenue retention remains at record levels for the year as we continue to bring in even more focus on our higher-value clients. Demand for our comprehensive set of solutions, including our integrated Paychex Flex human capital management technology and our comprehensive ASO and PEO HR offerings remains high. Businesses of all sizes are facing continued pressure from supply chain and labor shortages, the rising cost of doing business and ongoing challenges with COVID-19. As staffing challenges persist, businesses are looking for integrated technology to deliver increased productivity, operating efficiencies and access to experienced HR professionals to help them navigate a complex regulatory environment and complicated distributed workforce dynamics. We continue to invest in our product set to differentiate us in the market and deliver solutions designed to meet the growing challenges of running a business. Our most recent product launch introduced a series of enhancements designed to support both an on-site and distributed workforce, including an enhanced iris scanning time clock, which delivers a hands-free punch experience with industry best security, including both the iris and facial scanning. A new secure document management solution, which allows clients to safely and confidentially store documents like employee vaccination status within the Flex platform, and a compensation summary, which allows clients to provide employees a full view of their compensation to promote retention, and enhancements to our financial wellness offering to help client employees more effectively budget, manage debt and save for retirement. Each of these enhancements builds on our award-winning Paychex Flex technology. Several industry awards provide the latest validation of the benefits of our innovative technology. We were recently recognized with two awards for our Paychex Pre-Check solution, the 2022 BIG Innovation Award presented by the Business Intelligence Group and a 2022 Stevie Award for innovation in customer service. Paychex Pre-Check combines payroll, HR, time and attendance and employee self-service into a complete system of check and balances ensuring that work hours are never missed, pay rates are properly applied, paid time off is not overlooked and that pay is always calculated correctly. We have seen a strong response in terms of both client adoption and client results with Paychex Pre-Check. Our focus on helping clients maximize available government stimulus was recognized by Accounting Today as we were awarded with a top new product award for our employee retention tax credit service. We recently surpassed $7 billion in total credits processed for our clients. I'm very proud of the agility demonstrated by our IT and service teams to proactively assist our clients with these government subsidies to help them sustain and enhance our clients' financial position. Our mobile and self-service technology solutions deliver efficiency for our clients and their employees, and we have seen significant increases in Flex sessions both through the desktop and mobile devices with an increasingly -- an increasing proportion of the sessions, of course, done by the mobile app. Contributing to this growth is traction we are gaining with wearable devices. The use of the Apple Watch has increased mobile usage for our time and attendance solution. Obviously, this provides another safer method for employees to punch in and out and avoid exposure to COVID and other illnesses. I am particularly proud of two awards that Paychex has recently been honored with -- for the -- our commitment to business integrity through our best-in-class ethics, compliance and government practices. For the 14th time, Ethisphere named us one of the world's most ethical companies. We are also on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies. These awards acknowledge our ethical business practices, our values-based culture, innovation, social responsibility and leadership. We believe doing business the right way leads to greater success. Ethisphere agrees, noting that their 2022 Ethics Index, a collection of publicly traded companies recognized as recipients of this year's world's most ethical companies designation outperformed the comparable index of large-cap companies by almost 25% over the past five years. I give credit to the innovation, integrity and hard work of our employees who live our Paychex values each and every day. In summary, we are very proud of our performance during the third quarter and year-to-date, and I thank our employees for their tireless dedication during our busiest time of the year. Our set of innovative technology and service solutions provides industry-leading value to our clients and leaves us well positioned for a strong finish for fiscal 2022 and continued growth into fiscal 2023. I'll now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results for the third quarter. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Marty. Good morning. Thanks for being on the call. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements, refer to the customary disclosures. Let me start by providing some of the key points for the quarter. I'll follow up with greater detail in certain areas. I'll finish with a review of fiscal '22 outlook and some very, very, very preliminary thoughts on fiscal 2023. Our third quarter results reflect strong internal execution, as Marty mentioned, and continued improvement in key indicators, service revenue and total revenue increased 15% to $1.3 billion. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue increased 13% to $960 million driven by higher client bases across our HCM suite, check volumes, revenues per check -- revenue per client, payroll funding and outsourced service for temporary staffing clients and ancillary HR services resulting from ERTC, which Marty just mentioned.  Although the revenue associated with ERTC is substantially nonrecurring, ERT has afforded Paychex the opportunity to continue to deepen its relationship with clients, increased revenue with clients and showcase its industry-leading suite of solutions for small and medium-sized businesses. A significant opportunity remains both inside and outside our base.  And one thing I'd like to point out here is, there are a number of HCM platforms in the market, you all know that, but they're only a select few partners. In order for you to be able to access the opportunities that arise from having an HCM suite with bundled ancillary services, you have to be a partner, not simply a platform provider. There's only a few of those in the market. Our results demonstrate the power of being one, and we are one of the leading ones. So our results are not surprising to us.  Our clients want to know the difference between a MEP, a SEP and a PEP. They want to know what the implication of the ERTC is for their business and they want to know what the implications of legislation like the Secure Act is -- how it's going to impact their business. We know that. We're experts and we're the partner that our clients look to, for solutions to those issues. Our results demonstrate that this quarter.  Now client base growth in the quarter resulted from both strong sales performance and high levels of client retention. In particular, HR Solutions business continues to benefit from strong demand as businesses look for more HR Support. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 21% to $302 million. Our PEO business benefited from higher average worksite employees, state unemployment insurance revenue and health insurance attachment.  Interest on funds held for clients decreased 5% for the quarter to $14 million as the impact of lower average interest rates was partially offset by an increase of 13% in average investment balances. And obviously, this is one of the things that's going to change as we go through both the remainder of the year and into the next year. We haven't seen the impact of rising rates yet, we will.  Total expenses increased 11% to $713 million. The growth in expenses resulted from higher PEO direct insurance costs, headcount to support our growing client base and continued investment in our product, technology, sales and marketing. Op income increased 20% to $563 million with an operating margin of 44.1%, an expansion of almost 200 basis points. Our effective income tax rate was 22.3% compared to 24.2% for the same period last year. Both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to both to stock-based compensation benefits -- or payments, I'm sorry. In addition, the current quarter includes tax benefits related to prior year research and development expenses incurred in the production of customer-facing software. So we had an adjustment there, and that's part of our lower tax rate. Net income and diluted earnings per share both increased 23% for the quarter to $431 million and $1.19 per share, respectively, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20% for the quarter to $419 million and $1.15 per share, respectively. I'll quickly highlight our results for the nine-month period ending February 28. Both revenue and earnings have grown by double-digits for each of the past three quarters. Total service revenue and total revenue growth of 15% each to $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. Expenses, excluding one-time costs incurred during the prior year, increased 7%. So we've gotten very good leverage. Operating income and adjusted operating income were $1.4 billion, increases of 31% and 27%, respectively. Diluted earnings per share increased 31% to $3.02 per share, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $2.95 a share. Let me walk through the highlights of our financial position. As you all can see, it's very strong. Cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments now total of $1.4 billion and our total borrowings of approximately $806 million is where it stood at February 28, 2022. Cash flow from operations was robust in the quarter. It was at $1.2 billion, an increase of 34% from the same period last year. Free cash flow generated for the nine months was $1 billion, up 36% over last year. The increases were driven by higher net income and fluctuations in working capital. We paid out quarterly dividends at $0.06 a share for a total of $750 million during the first nine months, our 12-month rolling return on equity was 44%. Those are strong numbers. Now I will turn to our guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2022. The outlook reflects the current macro environment, which saw improvement in the quarter despite some disruption from Omicron, we've taken that into account -- we've taken into account the fact that third quarter results exceeded expectations, but have tempered our outlook given the changing macroeconomic environment, and we provided the following updated fiscal 2022 guidance as you saw, Management Solutions revenue is now expected to grow in the range of 12% to 13%. We previously guided to growth in the range of 10% to 11%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 13% to 14%. We previously guided to growth in the range of 10% to 12%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be relatively flat year-over-year. We won't see the impact yet significantly of Fed raises. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 12% to 13%. We previously guided to growth in the range of 10% to 11%. Adjusted operating income margin is expected to be approximately 40%, up from previous guidance of 39% to 40%, adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the range of 44% to 45%, up from previous guidance of approximately 44%. And Other expense net is expected to be approximately $15 million. Our previous guidance was in the range of $15 million to $18 million. Effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%. We previously guided in the range of 24% to 25%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 22.5% to 23%. We previously guided to growth in the range of $18 million to $20 million. This guidance reflects our intention to continue to invest in our businesses to help drive future growth. And I would just comment that in the fourth quarter, we intend to take some additional actions with respect to investment in the business. So that will temper the margin a little bit as we head into 2023. Now comments on 2023, we're currently in the process of preparing our annual plan. We'll provide guidance, final guidance for fiscal 2023 during our fiscal 2022 fourth quarter in June. But I want to provide a preliminary thought process around fiscal 2023 as we enter the planning cycle. On a preliminary basis, we believe the total revenue growth will be in the upper single digits. At this stage, I'd call that somewhere around 7% and I would caution that, there's a lot of work to be done to digest completely where the Fed is going to end up and how we position the portfolio. So there's still some moving pieces there. The other thing we would say right now \u2013 with respect to operating margins, we expect an improvement of about 50 basis points. You know that typically, that's what we're aiming for. We've had very, very significant operating margin improvement, but we're still committed to leveraging the business. So that's where we're at right now. I want to call out one thing that's important. Other expense net is going to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million next year due to the absence of equity gains that we got this year. So we have a portfolio that we invest in and equity gains during the year. Those will not be in next year at least we don't -- can't plan on them or anticipate they will be there. And then the effective tax rate will be in the range of 24% to 25%. Of course \u2013 all of this is very preliminary. It's subject to revision, and it's based on assumptions that could change given the uncertain macro environment, especially as we gain additional insight into what the Fed actually will do. We'll update you again on the fourth quarter call. So with all of that, I'll turn it back over to Marty. Martin Mucci : Thank you, Efrain. We'll now open the call to questions. Katie? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question will come from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Bryan Bergin : Good morning, guys. Martin Mucci : Hi, Bryan. Bryan Bergin : I appreciate you giving us an early fiscal 2023 view here. So Understanding you've got some outsized double-digit growth comps materializing this year. That's good to hear for next year's number. I guess, more importantly though, a question we're often getting is how to think about a sustainable level of growth in your business \u2013 you've had some peers speak to medium-term targets in the model. Anything you could share as a framework for how you're thinking about maybe longer-term growth based on what you're seeing in the market and what you've done here to drive that stronger sales execution. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Hey, Bryan, first of all, thanks, really, the comments. I think that we start with, I guess, two things and then one further building block. With respect to management solutions, many of you heard me say this, we start with the premise that we're going to be at least mid, and we would hope over that time frame to get above mid- to upper single digits in management solutions. When we get to Q4, we'll call that out a little bit more. And then, on the PEO and insurance side, we expect to be around double digits. So we start with that premise that yields a certain revenue growth, that we think is going to be upper single digits. And then the other thing is that, our expectation is that we will leverage. And in typical years, we averaged at least 50 basis points; some years, we won't do that. Some years, we'll do 200. So a year like this year from a leverage perspective doesn't come around that long. So I don't suspect there will be too many 200 basis points leverage years in us. But we do expect to continue to leverage going forward, certainly over the intermediate term. And just one other point on that. That's not simply an arithmetic exercise. It's a function of all of the work that's being done in the background around automating and making the business more efficient. I said earlier in the comments that -- we have a -- we are a leading HCM suite provider. But what makes us so unique is, we do that at margins that are industry leading. And so -- we work very hard on that. That's as we go into a planned process here, that will be a mantra that's repeated over and over, and we expect to be able to deliver on those commitments over the intermediate term. Martin Mucci : And I think, just to add to that, on the sales execution, we feel very strong this year. We've had great sales execution. Selling season was very strong, record third quarter sales performance. And as we've been going through it, really, across the board, so we're really pleased that not only the marketing and brand work we've done, but the product development that we've done in innovation there has really, I think, hit the marketplace very well at a time. We really timed it very well to hit the market with the HR support that businesses and prospects, current clients and prospects needed from attracting and hiring and retaining talent, we really hit the right timing on that. And then in addition to it, as Efrain said, this just doesn't happen. The thought that went into the employee retention tax credit, which has been very successful for us, we've been able to go to current clients and prospects and talk about how we can get this government subsidy for you. And those tax credits have averaged around $180,000 per client. And when you think of our average client size, it's a significant dollar amount that adds, as Efrain mentioned earlier, a lot of value -- and then to say, 'hey, not only are we helping you with that, here's how we can help you continue to sustain your growth in your business. It's been very successful. And we don't -- that's how we play the game. So we feel we'll continue to be able to do that. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Makes sense. And just a follow-up on retention. So can you just share where unit retention landed here in 3Q. It doesn't sound like you have any change of your holding higher post pandemic levels, but correct me if I'm wrong there. And just one thing, are you seeing any change in the gap between unit and revenue retention, as your mid-market and larger client push materializes? Efrain Rivera : It's a good question. I think revenue retention is a little higher. And so we are seeing a little bit of a gap there, as you'd expect just based on the size of the clients and that we're getting more mid-market success in both sales and retention. The overall retention number is going to be better than pre-pandemic, at least that is experienced to be right now. It's better than pre-pandemic. We think that will stay through the rest of the fiscal year. And \u2013 but not quite at the record levels. But we -- it doesn't surprise us. I think a lot of people held on through the pandemic, and we're trying to figure out where they were. But again, things like the employee retention tax credit, those things have helped our retention, and we're trying to see if businesses even under the pressure that they're under, can still sustain their business and keep themselves going. There's a lot of challenges out there, as you know, with supply chain and just inflation and so forth. And so we're a little cautious. But right now, we don't see that impacting them very much. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : All right, Bryan. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. First one I had was just on the pricing environment in the PEO business, specifically. Are you seeing any noticeable change in the aggressiveness of your competitors when it comes to price? And if so, is that something that's had any impact on new business generation or competitive win rates to this point? Martin Mucci : Yes. No, we have not. I don't see any real changes in that environment. We've been able to, I think, take good price, get good price on our sales and have not seen any increase in the need to discount further or anything like that. So we've been very pleased with not only had sales at a record level, but we've been able to hold price as well. Efrain Rivera : Andrew, the other thing I'd add is, first of all, nice report on the PEO industry, by the way. The other part is if you get aggressive on price in the wrong way, in the PEO, you pay a ferocious price, but you don't get -- you don't pay the price in the next six to 12 months -- if you discount your health care insurance and then don't price it appropriate to market, and of course, you know this better than I do, you pay a price down the road. So we are really, really careful on that point. I would say it's one of the five things we're probably most careful about is pricing all of that ancillary -- all of the insurance, direct insurance in a way that's appropriate to the risk. And we haven't had any blowups. We monitor that closely. So -- we think there's a really compelling value prop in PEO that's going to continue to grow, but it won't be on the basis of selling cheap insurance. We were very cautious about that. Andrew Nicholas : No, that's helpful. And part of why I ask is because some of the conversations we've had indicate maybe \u2013 maybe there are some other players that are being aggressive on that front. So not specific to Paychex. In terms of my follow-up, Efrain, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks at the end that you intend to take some additional investment actions in the fourth quarter. Could you spend a little bit more time talking about areas of interest there? Just to give us a little bit more insight on what to look out for going forward. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Yes, Andrew, I can take some of that, too. I would say there's certainly, as you can expect, from an employee retention standpoint, there's some actions we want to take and kind of move some of that up in the process. There's also more marketing. We're finding good response to our SEM and SEO investments on brand and also the products that's worked well with us for sales in the last three quarters. So, we decided to continue to spend there. And then some of the investment in IT that we would have planned typically to start into the first quarter, we can move some of that up we feel and accelerate it to get the products out even a little faster that are coming up. So, it's really kind of across the board. The other thing is, we have been hiring. So, we got a little low in the first part of the year, particularly in service and with turnover and so forth, we have now accelerated that hiring and done well in the third quarter and that will pick up some additional costs in the fourth quarter. Andrew Nicholas : Make sense. Thank you very much. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Thanks so much. Hey Efrain, hey Marty nice job. Thanks so much for the preliminary results in terms of outlook for '23. Is there any way to frame what type of Fed funds is in that 7%? I just -- I didn't get that. I know it's fluid, but is there any way to think about just initial thoughts on that? Efrain Rivera : We have some. We don't have all the big teen at this point in the preliminary outlook, Kevin. We want to get a sense of whether 6 is real, 4 is real, 9 is real, 8 is real. And I think we're all trying to read the tea leaves is at 50 is it 25. We have what we would -- I can characterize as a moderate scenario, certainly not the most aggressive. A lot of that growth is really more being driven by improvements in operating performance. And if the Fed gets very constructive and we avoid a recession that's part of what we'll have a better -- a clearer answer to when we get to June. Kevin McVeigh : That's super helpful. And then my other question is more, I don't know if it's longer term or whether it's for you or Marty, but can you help us understand the addressable market of Paychex today versus last cycle? Because obviously, you've done a ton of investment it seems like what you're able to offer your clients is much more robust today. Is there any way to think about kind of whether it's a dollar amount or just, how you're thinking about the addressable market today versus maybe what it was coming out of the last cycle? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think definitely from the product set that we offer and the integration with Flex in the digital approach to everything we've done. I think it is definitely larger. I don't know if I could put a dollar amount on it, but I think our success in the mid-market sales in particular and the retention there over the last three quarters has really shown that we're hitting the mark, as I mentioned earlier. We really focused on the \u2013 what would be the impact of coming out of COVID, kind of the heavy COVID period, which is that distributed workforce.  How do you allow the hiring, the onboarding, the retaining of employees who are maybe distributed or maybe in the office how do you handle all that? I think those products have really positioned us well to a larger mid-market base. It's not necessarily larger clients, but I think maybe a broader set of solutions that will hit a lot of different areas for clients.  And I think at the same time, I think we positioned ourselves well that from what the client is really feeling coming out of COVID. It opened up an opportunity like distributed workforces to say, let me tell you how powerful the mobile Apple Flex is. management did for a team the other day, an investment team looking at products, just the mobile app of time and attendance and how that works and how you can, of course, punch in and out, but how you can shift swap remotely, alert someone that you don't need this shift or you don't need that ship and open it up and take it. And all that is done on a mobile app for across employees, very powerful not to mention retention analytics a lot of the analytics work that we've given to clients. So, I think a long answer, I think we've opened up a lot more opportunities for us at a very perfect time to do that. Efrain Rivera : The other thing I'd add, Kevin, is -- and this quarter really is a demonstration of that. When COVID started, we were doing a lot of consulting with our clients and not -- we weren't charging it. It wasn't monetized. But I will say that in the midst of the pandemic, some of our competitors referred their clients to our website in terms of information. I think as we progress through COVID, what we learned was that there is a tremendous amount of opportunity in the services that attach around the HCM suite. So, ERTC is a great example of that situation. Retirement Services promises to be another important opportunity going forward. And there will be others, which we don't know a lot about right now because they haven't been surfaced. What we're finding is that, that -- in addition to the technology that Marty highlighted, that technology opens another door for the opportunity to provide a set of solutions that clients are interested in once we inform them about it or once we partner with them. And I would say our marketing, our product, our IT teams and our compliance teams also are all working very hard and including I put in our legal team, too to uncover those kinds of opportunities that we can monetize. So, there -- within the product set, there's one set of opportunities. And I think there's this growing amount of services that we can provide our clients that play off our technology and that part will be looking to dimension as we go forward. but it's becoming increasingly important. Martin Mucci : Yes. And you got excited to talk about this now that adding to what Efrain just said, it's the use of the data. We really have maximized the use of our client data now. And like when the Paycheck Protection loan started, our -- the teams here figured out, hey, look, we use the data to immediately alert the clients that they could file for the loans and we could basically pre-populate the entire application other than they have to sign it. When it became, you could add other expenses in there. Okay, just to add the other expenses. But we pre-populated if you're a client of ours, all of the data that we have in our system. And then -- and so 94%, 95% of those loans now have all been, by the way, turned into grants. So, they've all been approved as complete grants. So, it's also using the power of our data. And as Efrain said, the employee retention tax credit was we use the data to now go to our clients and say, look, based on what we have in our data, we think you can apply for this. And you fill out -- you sign a couple of things electronically, and we'll help you file, and we'll amend the returns and you're going to have $180,000 on average, that's a big deal. So, that added a lot of value to the clients that said, wow, I didn't realize that Paychex could do all this for me and it added a lot, I think, to the retention and the brand value of what we could do for them. Kevin McVeigh : Makes a lot of sense. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks, guys. Good morning. Efrain, I just wanted to start by probing some of your comments in the prepared remarks around macro. I think you said something to the effect of tempering your outlook. But obviously, you raised the outlook, at least for revenue for the year by more than what you just beat the quarter by. So I just wanted to try and reconcile that. Is that really reflected in the initial outlook for 2023? Efrain Rivera : Yeah. Yeah. That was mostly for people like you, Jason who would dig me on why aren't you more constructive on Q4. As a number of you who know me, and who I've known you for now a number of years, we're going to point out about how we're looking at Q4. There's an element of caution in Q4. And if you look at where facets in Q4, you can derive an imputed number for Q4. Our flow through of what we think could be revenue in the quarter. That's one. And then second, when we were putting all the data together, I think the macro environment looked \u2013 it was looking a little bit more uncertain than maybe it is right now. And I don't mean that something suddenly changed in the last week, but the environment is kind of volatile. And I just wanted to highlight that we're sitting here feeling okay from a macro perspective. By the way, business-wise, we feel very okay, but things could change in the next \u2013 over the next month. And so I just want to inject small note of caution to what was a really strong quarter for us. Jason Kupferberg : Yeah. Yeah, it was. Okay. Totally understand. I know, I think the past couple of quarters, you've been calling out some tailwinds from temp staffing clients, and I was just curious, if you can quantify maybe how much of a lift that is provided to management solutions and your thoughts on sustainability of the tailwind? Efrain Rivera : We \u2013 it's modest, Jason. So many of you know that we provide funding for staffing companies just to make sure everyone's clear, we don't \u2013 we're not in the staffing business. We're in the funding of the staffing business. The staffing business has been on fire over the last six months. And so our funding business has done very, very well this year. So it's still modest. It's a highly profitable business for us. But it's contributed in the mix of things that have gone well, and it's a long list of things that have gotten well this year. It's one of the businesses that's had a pretty robust recovery. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Yeah. Appreciate the color. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Yep. Okay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Hey, good morning, Marty and Efrain. Efrain, I know one of the areas we always talk about is pays per control, and you've talked about how in this environment that's been difficult. I'm wondering what the trend\u2019s been? And what you kind of expect the trend to be over the next six months or so? Efrain Rivera : Yes, Kartik. I mean, you know better than most. If I would have said at this point that, unemployment was at 3.8%. I think that, most people would have thought, I was -- and that we were going to base a plan on that, that idea at 3.8%. Yes, look, it's been more robust than we thought. I'll let Marty comment, because we just -- we just, I should say, released the employment index. And so we got a little bit more -- he's got a lot more color on that than I do. But I would say, there -- you're getting to the point where it's going to get difficult for that number to run. It's been running positive and it's been running ahead of what we thought. But you're getting to a point where it's going to be difficult to continue to run quite as hot as it's been. So I'll let Marty talk a little bit. Martin Mucci : Yes. I think, we've seen -- Kartik, in the index, this is really the clients under 50 in that index. But we continue to see strong job growth, and it has moderated the last two months, but it's still strong growth over last year. And I think, as we've sold more into the mid-market as well, we're seeing probably a little bit better growth there from the number of employees, because we're into a larger client size. And I think what we're trying to measure is, with the things that are going on now in the macro environment, what is that going to mean going forward? Like, they haven't -- there's a number of government subsidies, but are we getting to the end of those. Now we still think, by the way, the employee retention tax credit will help us in next year as well and help our clients, because there's still a lot we can file for, as we go back through the process. But, I think, it's just, how much are they going to grow going forward. Right now, there's a bit of pessimism in small clients as to -- between inflation, supply chain, et cetera, should we be a little bit careful, but they have demand, right, especially restaurants and so forth. So when you look at leisure and hospitality, job growth is up 21%, the fastest of all of them, but how will that continue given inflation concerns and supply chain stuff that continues. So we'll see. I think it's still positive. We're still seeing growth, but it's moderating. Kartik Mehta : And then, Marty, just on pricing. Every business has taken -- have taken the opportunity to raise prices, just because of the environment we're in and everybody is faced with inflationary pressures, just like you are. Now, I'm wondering, maybe, what the strategy is for Paychex from a price standpoint, as we move forward or at least for this year. Martin Mucci : I think, what we're seeing is, the opportunity to be at the high end of our range. The range would still be in that same, but I think we'll be at the high end of that range. Our -- some costs are up, obviously, for us. But I think that the value of the products to our clients have increased is the -- all the things we've talked about before, with the help that we're giving them through government subsidies, with all of the value we're giving them in HR, then all the product investments we've made. So I think that they\u2019ll tolerate that quite well, actually, because we're just going to be toward the high end of the range that we normally would have. Kartik Mehta : All right. Thank you, both, very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson. Eugene Simuni : Thank you. Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Two quick follow-ups. One, just on retention. I just wanted to clarify separating between out-of-business churn and competitive losses. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit on how those two things are trending in relation to the still near record high retention levels overall? Is it across both of those metrics, or is it one of them now picking up in terms of churn versus the other. Martin Mucci : Yes. Out of business is pretty solid. And so the competitive has not changed all that much really. And in fact, if you look at where our largest competitor, if you -- we always look at how much have we sold to their clients and sold them away from the competitor and how much have we lost were a net gain at this point. So we're not losing any more really to competitors, some, but for here and there, but really we're pretty solid on the retention kind of across the board as to how we're doing. Obviously, if we're near record levels, we're continuing to be pretty steady in where we are in retention. Eugene Simuni : Yes. Got you. And yes, sorry, just to wrap it -- so out of business in terms of like bankruptcies as we maybe move away from government stimulus, you're not really seeing that pressure yet in your business\u2026 Martin Mucci : No. Not yet. Eugene Simuni : Great. And then \u2013 great, and then another quick one on the PEO, just wanted to see if you can provide some color on what drove the 21% growth in revenue across the major drivers that you call out, which is worksite employees and the contribution of the insurance revenue to that number? Martin Mucci : Yes. I'll start and Efrain can jump in. I think, one, we've had very solid sales, very strong sales results. And then with those sales results, we've seen great attachment to insurance, so better attachment for insurance products. I think that's very reflective of the need to provide insurance and the good benefit plans an opportunity that the PEO provides clients and prospects. And then last, we've seen, obviously, an increase in worksite employees from the clients that we have. So they've been adding back employees. So you really kind of got it across the board. You got good sales, good solid retention. You got a better attachment to insurance and growing worksite employees of the existing base. Efrain Rivera : Yes. And the other -- the only other two to round that out is increasing wages and increase set sooner. So you got really, I don't know there's nights. -- a lot more than a trifecta, but a lot of good things going on. We had a really strong PEO quarter. I mean, obviously, the results speak for themselves, but it was a good quarter in PEO land. Eugene Simuni : Yes. Got it. Got it. So sorry, so your worksite employee growth, was it -- how was it relative to this maybe 21% number, I assume it was lower since there were other factors, but can you give us a sense of where it was? Martin Mucci : Can you give us some of the worksite employee growth? Efrain Rivera : We'll update that, Eugene, at year-end -- we don't separate out PEO, so you're not disappointed, but we -- it's included in our overall worksite employees served. -- in our HR outsourcing businesses. But the numbers, it's -- both have been pretty robust growth. Eugene Simuni : Got it. Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Hey, good morning, everybody, and thanks for all the color. I wanted to follow up on previous question and some of your commentary. First, on your own customer retention. Obviously, great work there. And you continue to operate at record levels and not really seeing the softening that you had anticipated maybe a couple of quarters ago. But I'm wondering like how are you adjusting your planning for that long-term retention level? And what should we think that, that could baseline at down the road? Efrain Rivera : Well, I think right now, as I've said, it's a little dicey given, okay, we had some government stimulus that they were able to -- some clients were able to take advantage of. At the same time, you've got rising inflation and then supply chain hopefully getting better. So, you've got a lot of macro things going on at the same time. Right now, we'd expect that it's still going to be strong. I don't -- based on how we are year-to-date, we've said we're not at record levels that we had last year, but we're better than pre-pandemic.  We would expect that we continue to be at better than pre-pandemic levels that we have added a lot of value to our clients and that it will continue to be strong. I think that's how we feel. But there's a lot of macro stuff that could go on there with again, with bankruptcies and things like that, that right now, we haven't seen. So, our expectation going forward is that, we're at a pretty similar level to where we are right now. James Faucette : Got it. No, that's actually really helpful context. And then as far as your investment that you've called out multiple times here and what you want to do, at least in the period on what you're giving guidance over the next quarter or so and then how we should think about that longer term. Can you talk a little bit about where you're seeing opportunities for organic investment and what's the time to pay back on those and what we should be looking for either from a product or service perspective as you continue to invest there? Martin Mucci : Yes. I think it's definitely two main things, which would -- well, maybe three. So, you got sales investments, so we'll be continuing to invest in our sales teams. We'll be growing the sales team in select markets. But we're really across the board to see better opportunities for investing in sales. Two is marketing costs. We'll continue to invest in marketing. It's driving a lot of leads into the business and that's the way people are obviously searching and buying now. So, we're going to continue to see that investment go up and it's not getting any less expensive to do it.  And I'd say three, would be product. We're going to see new product, as you've seen from us, we've had new product releases, basically every season. We kind of look at them as a season type of thing. And in the spring and summer season, we'll have continued new products that we rolled out. We just released kind of talked about our winter release now going into the spring release, you're going to just see continued product enhancements to what we have.  It is going to -- we continue to do a lot, again, as I said, with our data and from a digital standpoint and really maximizing the use of that mobile app, so that we can build even more retention strength with the employees of our clients -- they're the ones that are using that mobile app and always have, even more than our clients. So we're giving -- trying to give our clients, employees everything they possibly can on their mobile app to produce better retention for us and not allow their employer to leave Paychex or want to leave Paychex, just like the diamond attendance, just like punching in and out, ship swapping and being able to do things like when we hire someone, everything is digital now. Everything is paperless. From the time we post with Indeed, we have that automatic integration with Indeed. You can post on Indeed, the world's largest job site that's broad -- that client is -- or that prospect or applicant is brought in without paper. When they hire them, it's brought on and onboarding. You're going to just see us continue to build out our HR suite where everything is around that mobile app to build strength and sustainability for the client. James Faucette : Hey, Marty, Efrain, thank you so much as always for your time. Martin Mucci : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Mark Marcon : Hey good morning and congratulations on the strong quarter. Martin Mucci : Thanks Mark. Mark Marcon : I was wondering a little bit on the new sales. It sounds like things are going really well there. I'm wondering if you can comment a little bit about, are you seeing any sort of change in terms of the source of new sales -- are you -- you mentioned your largest competitor and being a net gainer there. But relative to everybody else that the public companies know about or the public companies that are out there -- or also just the local and regionals and any sort of upshift in terms of on-premise systems, both as it relates to your core sized clients and then also the progress that you're making on the midsized clients. Martin Mucci : I'd say on the small side, market continues to be really online. Even a little bit less from -- still pretty strong from CPA referrals and client -- existing client referrals. But more and more of those, we've seen -- and this is over the last few years, it may be in the old days, the CPA would refer us and then the call would come right to us. The CPA may now refers, but someone then looks and comes in through the web and to buy. So, we're definitely seeing an increase from web sales, particularly in the low end and you're going to see even more of those sales come in on a self-serve onboarding basis where the client can sign themselves up in come in in search. So, it's going to be -- and then of course, we've learned that with all of -- virtually all of the salespeople working remotely and virtually, that has been very strong for sales to come in and be sold over the phone or over the web. I think on the mid-market side, yes, I think we've done very well against the competitors that you know well and cover, and we've taken some back some clients back that have left us and found as Efrain mentioned, very eloquently earlier that we have a total platform. You can buy certain pieces of it, but we have a total product set, not just one platform they have your payroll on and then connect to everybody else. We have everything if you want it and makes it much more seamless. And we also can keep whatever components you want on your own and API into virtually anybody through a marketplace. So, I think we've seen, yes, definitely a growth in the opportunity to take back some share from competitors, and we think that's going to certainly continue as we continue to add product. Mark Marcon : Great. And then can you talk a little bit on the PEO side in terms of the strong growth that you're experiencing there? How much of it is coming from upsells as opposed to new logos? Martin Mucci : I think you'd see a majority probably from upsell, but there's plenty of new logos now that are coming in new businesses that for the first time are -- and especially in those states where we're prominent, the Florida is the Georgia, the Texas they're new to PEO and are not necessarily coming from ASO. But I would say a slight majority are still up sales we're really good at that. They know us, and there's a great close rate there saying, hey, you're on payroll only or maybe your ASO, but you want to go to a better benefit, opportunities, better benefit plans and go into the PEO where you're kind of in those shared plants and so forth. So I'd say a slight majority from up-sells. But \u2013 but plenty of new logos. We've really been very successful, obviously, if you're growing over 20% in the quarter. Mark Marcon : Great. And then two sort of related macro questions. One, just in terms of the preliminary thoughts with regards to 2023, how are you thinking about float balance growth? That's one. And then two, just a clarification with regards to the tempering of expectations. Are you actually seeing anything that's actually occurring on the ground, or is your comment more related to just the expectation that there would be some reason for tempering, obviously, if rates end up going up significantly. Efrain Rivera : I think it's more of the latter, Mark on that question. Look, hey, it's all fun and games to say that, we're going to get all the benefit from six, seven, eight raises depending on your perspective, but you've got to be somewhat cautious about what the impact on the economy as a whole, especially on the small end of the market would be, I \u2013 we don't have any crystal ball. You have a better one than we do, but that's an issue that we need to realize because the Fed will take and the Fed will give and we're trying to analyze how all of that looks. With respect to balance growth, I would say, it's probably going to be low single digits to the mid-single digits at this point. Depending on what's happening with wage inflation and the other factors that go in insurances. At this point, that's what our thought process is. We've had a pretty robust growth this year, obviously, the recovery in wages and in clients, it's helped a lot. So it will moderate a bit next year. Mark Marcon : Great. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Thanks, Mark. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Efrain Rivera : Hi, Tien-Tsin. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hey, good morning, great results and profitability. I wanted to\u2026 Efrain Rivera : Thanks. Tien- Tsin Huang : \u2026quickly if you don't mind, just one question, ask about existing versus new client revenue growth? I'm just thinking about what you said, I think, Efrain, you said it or maybe Marty double-digit annualized contract value growth sounded like it was broad-based. So just trying to disaggregate that comment with the growth outlook thinking about it between new clients versus existing clients, if that makes sense, just because it seems like your first look at 23% is pretty consistent with what we typically would observe. I just want to make sure the composition is different? Efrain Rivera : Yeah. So let me take that, Tien-Tsin. So, I think it is pretty consistent with what we observed. We typically are going to generate about half of our new logos, if you will, from newly foreign businesses. We expect that to continue going into next year. And then with the normal amount of upsell and cross-sell, and growth in revenue per client that we end up getting. So obviously, the net adds will come half of it will come from newly form business. Our new sales will come from newly formed businesses. And then there was one thing that I highlighted that's important is \u2013 and I think it was in response to Kevin's question, we're seeing more opportunity to add revenue online as we see more opportunity for the kinds of services that, for example, ERTC as well. So it \u2013 it's easy to overlook that, but it's part of the way as Marty said is part of who we are. Tien- Tsin Huang : Perfect. That's what I needed. Because it looks like you're -- yes, despite the tough comp, get sort of back on, what we usually want to expect from Paychex. So, thank you. Thank you, guys. Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Tien- Tsin Operator : Thank you. Our next question and our final question for today is from Peter Christiansen with Citi. Peter Christiansen : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Great job, guys. Marty Mucci : Yes. Thanks. Appreciate it. Peter Christiansen : Yes, to the degree that you can tell, are you winning new business from previous like self-filers still? Is that still a reasonable pool to draw from on the new sales front? Marty Mucci : It is, definitely. I mean, there's still plenty of small businesses on the small side that are -- have tried to continue to do things themselves. And I do think over the last two years, that's become even more difficult, and they're losing a lot of opportunity by not going with someone. It's -- so, yes, that's still a great opportunity. It's still a big piece of the pie that's available out there that -- and you're making it easier for them to sign up and do everything themselves, but do it in an automated fashion, to someone who has over 200 compliance experts to make sure they're doing it right. So, yes, that's still a good opportunity for us. And that's why, as Efrain said, half of our sales are coming from new businesses and many of those new businesses may be new, but they might have even tried to do something themselves for a few months or a year before they went to someone like us. Peter Christiansen : That's interesting. And then, any thoughts on industry consolidation at this point, particularly from, I guess, the more private regional players. Do you see any trends evolving there? And then, maybe juxtapose that with how you're thinking about the M&A landscape for Paychex. Marty Mucci : Yes. I think, we've seen some of the smallest ones consolidated. It's just too difficult today for many of them to provide the product suite to that people are demanding and the online presence, the mobile app, the constant increase in product development. They're just not able to keep up and all the compliance. I mean -- and the government is not getting any easier to deal with, they want to -- particularly the IRS, they're underbudgeted, they're understaffed. So it's difficult for smaller payroll in particular companies to keep up with someone like us that has the powerful team behind the products. So I think there is some consolidation there. I wouldn't say any -- on the larger ones just yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if at some point, it just becomes too difficult to keep up with the investment. From an M&A standpoint, there're still plenty of things that we're looking at in PEOs, payroll, everything and a lot of other opportunities. We're finding opportunities. They're not always panning out. We're very selective. Obviously, we've had a great success rate over the -- particularly over the last 10 years on acquisitions. And we're very careful about what we add and that the valuation makes sense. And right now, the valuations are still a little lofty, I'd say. Peter Christiansen : Great. Well, thanks for the color. Really great. Thank you. Marty Mucci : Okay. All right. Efrain Rivera : Okay. All right. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn it back to our presenters for any additional and closing remarks. Martin Mucci : Thank you. At this point, we'll close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast, it will be archived for approximately 90 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our third quarter earnings release conference call and for your interest in paychecks. I hope you all continue to remain safe and healthy. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have an opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded and that I will be standing by should you need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn today\u2019s program over to Mr. Martin Mucci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, please begin. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 earnings release. Joining me today are Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer; and John Gibson, our President and Chief Operating Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended May 31, 2022. You can access our earnings release on the Investor Relations website and our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet, will be archived and available on the website for about 90 days. We will start today\u2019s call with an update on business highlights for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. Efrain will review our financial results and outlook for fiscal 2023 and we will then open it up for your questions or comments. We are very pleased to close out our fiscal year with yet another strong quarter. Our successful fiscal 2022 results reflect strong execution across the company. This includes our sales teams highlighting our value proposition, our service teams in retaining clients, our cross-functional partnership to get new products in front of clients quickly and a solid success in HR outsourcing and in the mid-market. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 24% reflects both strong revenue growth and margin expansion to an operating margin of approximately 40% for fiscal 2022. Our focus on cost control, lower discretionary spend and operating efficiencies has allowed us to both invest in our business and expand operating margins. Macroeconomic trends have been positive this year but with inflation at the 40-year high, there are concerns for potential of a recession in the near future. We continue to monitor key leading indicators for any signs of a change in the macroeconomic environment, but if have not seen any signs of deterioration at this time. Typically, the first signs of a macro economic recession would be a decline in employment levels at existing clients, an uptick in non-processing clients or a slowdown in sales activities. These indicators continue to trend in a positive direction. The latest Paychex IHS Small Business Employment Watch reflected a 12-month consecutive -- a 12th consecutive month of increasing hourly earnings gains, though, we did notice slowing a bit of the pace of job growth in May. However, this is more reflective of being near full employment and the difficulty of finding employees. Job growth at U.S. small businesses remained strong in the face of a tight labor market and inflation pressures. Earlier this year, John Gibson was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer. John has been leading our service operation since 2013 and we are glad to introduce you to him on this call and have him participate. I will now turn it over to, John, who will give us an update on our sales and service performance. John? John Gibson : Thank you, Marty. I am happy to be joining all of you today on this call and provide an update on our performance both for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022. We finished the year with over 730,000 total payroll clients, with growth driven by both strong sales and retention. In addition, we now service approximately 2 million worksite employees to our ASO and PEO offerings, with 18% growth in the fiscal year. We had a record level of new sales revenue for both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. Our sales teams truly executed across the board from digital sales in the low end and continuing momentum in the mid-market and very particularly strong demand in HR outsourcing and retirement. This reflects the strength of our value proposition and was aided by the improved sales productivity by our continued investments in demand generation and sales tools. Our service teams have worked tirelessly to both support our clients and our sales growth throughout the year. We are very pleased with our revenue retention, which was comparable to our pre-pandemic record of last year. We have continued to make strong progress in hiring and we actually accelerate some hiring into the fourth quarter to ensure we are fully staffed and ready to execute our goals in fiscal year 2023. We believe that by partnering with our clients and remaining agile and flexible in how we meet those needs, we will provide them the ability to focus on running their business and increase their success and navigating today\u2019s very complex business environment. Their ability to rely on Paychex to make the complex simple result and their continued success and will, of course, then lead to continued elevated retention that benefits everyone. I will now turn the call back over to Marty. Martin Mucci : Thanks, John. We continue to help our clients deal with the issues they consider most pressing. We were recently recognized for doing just that by receiving the HR Tech Award from Lighthouse Research and Advisory for the best SMB-focused solution in the core HR workforce category for the third consecutive year. What stood out about Paychex Flex was our ability to rapidly respond to changing conditions, delivering a product that is consistently up to date on the latest requirements. We have been able to help clients navigate challenges including recruiting and retaining talent during the great resignation, gaining access to government stimulus programs like the Employee Retention Tax Credit, enhancing benefit offerings and transitioning to a digitally-enabled distributed work environment. Our strong and resilient product suite of HR, payroll, insurance, retirement and PEO have been strategically designed to help businesses maximize every opportunity presented to them. We continue to see expanded utilization of our recruiting and applicant tracking solutions, designed to help businesses find talent in a low unemployment environment. Our deep integration with Indeed is helping our clients gain access to a strong set of candidates. Over 70% of the client employees hired through our Flex recruiting and applicant tracking module were sourced from Indeed, the world\u2019s largest job posting site. Our Retirement Solutions are also experiencing record demand due to state mandates and the need for differentiated benefit offerings to retain top talent. The introduction of our pooled employer plan further differentiates our solution set. We now help over 104,000 businesses and over 1.3 million client employees safe for a dignified environment -- retirement with industry-leading mobile technology, which allows employees to enjoy -- enroll in their retirement in just workplace. HR has historically been tasked with helping businesses stay compliant and manage their talent. With Paychex HR, we deliver on these goals while also helping businesses operate more efficiently. Paychex HR helps businesses replace paper with modern, easy-to-use digital processes through our cloud-enabled Flex mobile technology. Given current challenges with hiring and the rising cost brought on by inflation, we address head on the need for businesses to operate more efficiently. Over 1.7 million client employees were onboarded through a completely digital experience during fiscal 2022. Maximum gains in efficiency are obtained when the leading technology we bring to payroll, HR and time collection and scheduling are brought together. Paychex Pre-Check debuted in January and the early adopters of Pre-Check have benefited from the proactive approach of letting their employees preview and improve their checks prior to processing. Processes have been excited about the time savings and problem avoidance that comes with Pre-Check. We also continue to innovate in the PEO space, Paychex PEO offers a continuum benefits that is unique to our clients from traditional health, dental and vision, funded by the client to comprehensive employee volunteer packages, including options for employees to purchase anything from critical illness policies to pet insurance, to new and emerging benefit offerings like student loan subsidies, robust benefit offerings designed for part-time employees, telemedicine and mental health counseling. Our Paychex PEO provides a differentiated approach to benefits designed to help our clients attract and retain top talent. Managing cash flow is also a top priority for businesses as they are struggling to address the impact of supply chain issues and rising inflation. We continue to find ways for customers to access government stimulus, including helping our clients gain access to over $8 billion in employee retention and paid leave tax credits. This builds on the momentum of our $65 billion of PPP loan program initiative in 2020. Our award winning PPP forgiveness tool has been instrumental in helping our clients transition 96% of those loans to full loan forgiveness. At Paychex, we know our employees are critical to who we are and what we do, and I believe that our focus on employees and their well-being has helped us manage through the competitive labor market. We are identified as one of the America\u2019s Best Employers for Diversity by Forbes Magazine and we are recognized by Business Group on Health for offering one of the nation\u2019s top health and well-being programs with the Best Employers, Excellence in Health and Well-being Award. As fiscal 2022 came to a close, I am very proud of the excellent results we had for the year and excited about our continued growth. I want to thank our 16,000 employees who are key to our success and have done a tremendous job in this ever changing environment. With that, I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year as well as our guidance for fiscal 2023. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Marty, and good morning to all of you. It\u2019s great to join you, at the end of one of the most successful years in the company\u2019s history. Despite the success what you have from us and will always have is a team that\u2019s grounded and will continue to work to deliver shareholder returns that lead the market. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward invest -- forward-looking investment statements. Refer to the customary disclosures. I will periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures, please refer to the press release and investor presentation for more information. They are pretty modest adjustments. I will start by providing a summary of our fourth quarter financial results, quickly get on full year results and then provide some guidance for fiscal 2023. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, as you saw both service revenue and total revenue increased 11% to $1.1 billion. Management Solutions had another strong quarter, increasing to 12% to $845 million, driven by higher revenue per client and growth in our payroll client base. The higher revenue per client reflects product attachment across our HCM suite, higher employment levels within our base, pricing, revenue from ancillary services including our ERTC service. ERTC revenue reached approximately 1% of total service revenue, that\u2019s for the year. While we do not anticipate this revenue stream to continue at that level, there still remains a significant opportunity both inside and outside our base. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 10% to $284 million, driven primarily by higher average worksite employees and health insurance revenue. Interest on funds held for clients increased just 2% for the quarter to $15 million, due primarily to growth in average investment balances. Note that while recent rate hikes did not have a significant impact on the fiscal quarter, they will provide a tailwind for next year. Total expenses increased to 11% to $750 million. The growth in expense is resulted primarily from higher compensation cost due to increase headcount to support our growing client base, wage rates and performance-based compensation. In addition, we continue to invest in our products, technology and marketing. And I just want to call out the margin in the quarter, we made very deliberate choices in the fourth quarter to invest back in our client base and in our -- among our employees, that\u2019s why all of the flow through did not go down to the bottomline and that was a deliberate choice that we think leads to the future sustainability of the business and we think we are positioned very well, as a result of those choices. Operating income increased 11% to $394 million with an operating margin of 34.4%, adjusted operating margin was flat for the reasons, I just said, and we anticipated some hiring and marketing spend pull that into Q4. Net income increased 13% for the quarter to $296 million and diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $0.82 per share, despite all of that investment. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 13% for the quarter to $295 million, $0.81 per share, respectively, as I said, that adjustments were relatively modest. Full year fiscal 2022, let me touch on that quickly. You saw our total service revenue and total revenues both increased 14% to $4.6 billion. Expenses, including one-time costs incurred during the prior year increased 8%. Operating income and adjusted operating income increased 26% and 23%, respectively, to $1.8 billion. Adjusted operating margin was 39.9%, an expansion of 310 basis points over the prior year. And I just call it out, you will search high and low to find someone -- the companies that are at that level. We delivered that. We delivered that while investing in the company, because we think that we are not playing a game from the next quarter or the next year, we are playing a game for the long haul. That\u2019s what you do when you have that kind of company. Diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $3.84 per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increase 24% to $3.77 per share. I am really proud of our financial position. We delivered all of that and our financial position remains rock solid with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $1.3 billion, total borrowings were $806 million as of May 31. Cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion during the fiscal year. We translate earnings into cash. That\u2019s what we do. Free cash flow generated for the year was $1.3 billion, up 20% year-over-year. So earnings and cash flow were really strong this year. Given the strong performance and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders, in May, we increased our quarterly dividend 20% to $0.79 per share. And as many of you know, we have one of the leading dividend than certainly in our sector and industry. And during fiscal 2022, we paid out a total of $1 billion in dividends and we also repurchased 1.2 million shares of Paychex common stock for $145 million. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was a superb 45%. Now let\u2019s talk about 2023. I am going to turn to the upcoming fiscal year and our current guidance is as follows. Management Solutions revenue expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 8% to 10%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $85 million to $95 million. Let me just call out that this reflects increases in line with what we understand the fed is saying through the end of this calendar year. What does that mean specifically? It means that we think that interest rates by the end of calendar year 2022 will be approximately 3% in a quarter, give or take and we are assuming that in our plans at this stage. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 7% to 8%. Adjusted operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 40% to 41%, not only did we deliver a 300-basis-point increase, we are committing to additional leverage as we go into next year, despite having made a lot of investments in the business as we have gone a long. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be another stellar 44%. Other expense net is expected to be in the range of $5 million to $10 million. Just so you all remember that is a combination of both interest expense, less the -- gain the income on the portfolio, that\u2019s why it\u2019s $5 million to $10 million. We expect that we will see income from the portfolio offset some of the interest expense. Our effective income tax is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25% and adjusted diluted earnings per share at this point, we expect to grow in the range of 9% to 10%. This outlook assumes the current macro environment, which is all of you know has some uncertainty. We like you week-to-week struggle to understand sometimes what are the signals that are coming out of the federal government. I want to reiterate something that Marty said. The indicators in our business are strong as we exit the year. So that\u2019s not a concern certainly in the first half of the year in as much as we see it right now, second half, we will see. So where is inflation going to be? Don\u2019t know that. What is the Fed exactly going to do? We think we have some indicators, we will see what they end up doing. We obviously, given all of those comments, have better visibility into the first half of fiscal 2023 than the second half. So here\u2019s what we think about the first half. In the first half of the year at this stage, we expect total revenue growth to be in the range of 8% to 9% with an operating margin of approximately 39%. That\u2019s what we think will happen in the first half and then for the first quarter getting a little closer, we currently are anticipating total revenue growth will be in the range of 9% to 10% with adjusted operating margin in the range of 39% to 40%. Of course, all of this is subject to current assumptions, which are subject to change and we will update you again on the first quarter call. Let me refer you to the investor slides on our website for additional information. And with that, I will turn the call back to Marty. Martin Mucci : Thank you, Efrain. Operator, we will now open it up for questions or comments. Operator : Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you. Good morning. Appreciate all the helpful call-outs\u2026 Martin Mucci : Hi. Yeah. David Togut : \u2026Efrain, on fourth quarter margin impacts. Could you frame in your fiscal 2023 revenue margin -- revenue and margin guidance, specifically three things? First, what impact are you assuming from inflation on wage and other expenses? Second, if you could quantify your fiscal 2023 price increase? And third, if you could bracket for us your expectations on client revenue retention, are coming down from the pandemic-driven peak, how should we think about year-over-year change in client revenue retention FY 2023 versus FY 2022? Thanks. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Hey, David. Thanks for the questions. By the way that triple header there could take us about 30 minute. We will try to make it. So I am going to let Marty talk to the inflation question as I think that\u2019s a good one and kind of how we think about it in the year. It\u2019s baked into the numbers, obviously, we won\u2019t quantify a specific number, but we will tell you about what we are thinking about with respect to inflation and how it\u2019s affecting us, how we expect that will impact us. Martin Mucci : Yeah. I will touch on it, David and Efrain can jump in any place. I think from an inflation, most of us -- most of our expenses obviously, our wage were not really impacted, obviously, by a lot of material impacts, which is very good for us. Wage that we have captured in these numbers, we think are going to -- the wage increases are a little higher. As Efrain mentioned, we took some steps in the fourth quarter that was somewhere one-time, other were wages that we built in a little bit higher from a competitive market standpoint. The one-time things were some year-end bonuses and so forth that we did given our very successful year for employees. So we think we have captured it very well, wages were a little bit higher than we would normally go. That\u2019s expectation that happens in this first quarter, basically that the wages hit, we think we have captured them well. Other than that really not an overall large impact, we have controlled expenses very tightly, even coming out of the pandemic. Things that we have learned and experienced there with working from home, having sales remote, much less T&E costs, we have been able to continue that trend, yet still invest in the business. So I think the guidance you have there is very strong from a standpoint that we have got those inflationary numbers in there. Efrain Rivera : Yeah. So, I think, the thing I wanted to call out that Marty mentioned is that, we -- in the fourth quarter took a lot of actions that we think position us very well for 2023. So I think we have captured as much as we know right now. There is always some room to make further adjustments, but the adjustments from an inflationary standpoint are really around wages for us. So, I think, we have captured that. On the price increase, we have always said that we are in the 2% to 4% range. I would say this is a year that certainly was at the high end of that range and it varies depending on the product. I think the key thing there is to get the right mixture of value and price, and it\u2019s not just about raising prices, it\u2019s also about delivering better value. So I think we are good there. And then on the client retention, we had a really good year. John mentioned earlier that our pandemic high was -- approximately was a record and it was approximately 88%. When we close the books this year, we were at approximately 88%. So we had a really good year from a revenue retention standpoint. There\u2019s lots of elements to that, but I think we have made a lot of strides for more we were probably three years, four years, five years ago. So that\u2019s -- those are the answers to your question, David. David Togut : And then, Efrain, would you assuming for FY 2023 client retention, can you sustain the 88% or you assuming some step down? Efrain Rivera : I think it\u2019s comparable. I got to say that, it wouldn\u2019t be surprised -- it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see a little bit of slippage from that number simply, because I think we are transitioning in a more normalized environment, where you are going to see lots of competition. Our assumption in our plan is that discounting will go up a bit because of the level of competition. So everyone has come out of the pandemic swinging. I think some people are in better shape. Others are wobblier. We think we are in pretty good shape and we are in a position to defend pretty well. The other thing, I would say, on that, that\u2019s really helped us in the year as we had a really strong year in the mid-market. And I will let, Marty, talk to kind of what happened there, because that\u2019s really helped us too. Martin Mucci : Yeah. On the revenue retention side, it\u2019s a good point to make that will make probably a couple of times on this call. The mid-market really picked up. And as we said probably a year ago, there was kind of a pent-up demand that we saw a year ago where people had not made some decisions, that opened back up and we have been winning a lot mid-markets. The strongest year we have been in mid-market, probably, in our history and I think it\u2019s a great combination of sales execution, the products and the full suite of products that we are offering, that is really tailored to exactly what clients are looking for now. So we have had a lot of success there, would certainly help on the revenue retention from a go-forward standpoint. Not only are we selling better in that mid-market, but we are retaining in a very strong way as well. David Togut : Understood. Thank you very much. Efrain Rivera : Thank you, David. Martin Mucci : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Great. Thanks so much and congratulations. Hey, I don\u2019t know if this is for Marty or Efrain, but clearly, the retention feels like it\u2019s structurally at a higher level, like you may have been flow within a higher level of range. So maybe just help us understand kind of what drove that, was that kind of just the service post-COVID or more robust product offering? Is there any way to kind of think about what drove the structural and again realizing it probably comes off, but it feels like you are in a structurally higher level clearly than where you were in kind of 2007? Martin Mucci : Yeah. I will start. I definitely think Kevin that it, there is consistency there. So I think structurally you are right. We have seen really better -- from a controllable perspective we have definitely seen a trend of continued strength there. I think part of it is really the product side, certainly, I will take it from the product side and then have John talk about the rest of it. The products have just been very responsive and the continued used by the clients and their employees have made the retention stick and we have talked about that for many years, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever been stronger and it really accelerated during the pandemic as people were much more distributed in a workforce, remote workforces. Really got to use and had to use the technology more, the mobile app, for example, and online use as well, but the mobile app really got clients and their employees to use it more. That leads to better retention because clients and employees don\u2019t want to give it up, because they -- things like Pre-Check. They are seeing their check before its cut. They are seeing what their time is that they have returned in. Everything looks good. They know what they are going to get paid. They are able to change the retirement or see their retirement funds on the mobile app and change everything. They are able to on board in a paperless fashion. And so they are making their own direct deposit changes, their bank changes and other things. So all of that, as we talked about over the last few years, I think, has led to that structural improvement, which is pay the employees of my client want to stay with Paychex, because they are invested in us, not just the client\u2019s payroll or HR person. So, I will ask John to add to that as well, but I think that\u2019s a big piece of it. John Gibson : Yeah. No, Marty. And Kevin, I would say, this is probably a multiyear story. You go back before COVID. Things we have been doing in our service model to differentiate our service focus, things we are doing relative to competitive retention triggers, using AI and analytics to anticipate where we may have issues. All of those things have really led to us be getting a better handle on our controllable losses. And if you look, you go back to 2018 or in fiscal year 2019, you can really begin to see that dramatic piece. I would tell you particularly to Marty\u2019s point, not only the -- what we have done from a service perspective with relationship management and the upper market, things we are doing there in our HR outsourcing pieces. But we know that product attachment, particularly in retirement, particularly in HR, particularly attachment and utilization of our Flex product and technology tools, we to stickiness and we have been very aggressive in introducing our clients to that capability and so that\u2019s also creating a degree of stickiness. I mean, just -- I look at this all the time and in fact our price value losses were actually less this past fiscal year than they were at the record year. And if I go back to 2018 and 2019, it\u2019s about half of what we would typically have seen historically. So there is a structural component to this that we are going to continue to execute. There\u2019s more we can be doing there. And I feel good about what we can do on the controllable side. The uncontrollable is always a thing we are monitoring and watching. Kevin McVeigh : And then just one quick follow-up, Efrain, I will ask, I know if you could tell us. Like, in terms of the fourth quarter investment, it sounds like it was a little more variable. Is there any way to kind of frame what that was and I\u2019d imagine it was more kind of variable as opposed to fixed cost that would kind of repeat in 2023, is that fair? Efrain Rivera : Well, I guess so, Kevin. Let me answer it in a slightly different way and hopefully it\u2019s responsive what you are saying. So there were a mixture of one-time things that we did that were variable. There were things that we did structurally to increase wages in certain areas and then there were things that we put in place for -- as long-term incentive. So, I would say, one of them was -- one of those with respect to employees was more one-time and the other two were structural and will be their longer term. There were some other items that were not wage related that were also variable that we did in the fourth quarter. So, it was a mix of both. I wouldn\u2019t characterize it one way or the other in terms of percentages, but there were three buckets there, that ended up being part of the expense base. Martin Mucci : And I think as Efrain said, all of that obviously is in the guidance of increasing the margin. So even though somewhere more structural and ongoing wage expense or bonus expense, that\u2019s all in the increasing operating margin over 40% next year in the guidance. Efrain Rivera : Yeah. It\u2019s important. Kevin McVeigh : Super. Thank you, all. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Thanks, Kevin. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Bryan Bergin : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thank you. So commentary on 4Q is broadly positive here. I am hoping you could dig in more specifically on some of those key winning client indicators and what those have been telling in recent weeks? So can you give us a sense on what you are specifically measuring there? Efrain Rivera : Yeah. So, Bryan, what we did was, we kind of dusted off forward indicators we were looking at during COVID. So we go down to daily punches by employee, we did daily punches. I am talking about daily hours clock by employees and our clients. So obviously we have access to that information. We are looking at at that on a daily, weekly, monthly basis to understand what are the trends. We look at sales and we look at losses that\u2019s pretty obvious. And then we look at other micro indicators in terms of engagement with our systems and platforms. We put all of that together and look at those indicators to tell us, are we seeing any sharp changes. On top of all of that Marty mentioned, we have the HIS -- not the IHS employment index that we are looking at 350,000 clients. What\u2019s happening with that base and when you put that all in the blender at the moment, it doesn\u2019t look significantly different than the trends we have been seeing in the first half of the year. So, look, you guys are looking at a ton of different pieces of information. All I can say is, with respect to our corner of the HCM world and our corner of this part of the economy, things are looking about the way they look. And at this point, neither inflation nor the sharp -- beginning to be sharp rise in interest rate seem to be slowing things down. Having said that, I will temper as you all know with a note of caution, things could change, but at this point we are not seeing. Martin Mucci : Yeah. The thing that\u2019s consistent, Bryan, is the demand. That small and mid-size business is still seeing a great demand for products and services and its finding people. So job growth, if anything if it\u2019s slowed in the index, this is under 50 employees. As Efrain said, the growth is still there, but it\u2019s slowed a little bit. It\u2019s more because you are not being able to find the employees, everybody knows that you are hearing particularly front line, leisure and hospitality and other service functions, trying to find people, the demand is still there, so there is a hunger for the need. And you will hear it over and over, the reason that ASO and PEO have performed so well in sales and client retention is because there is such a need for HR support in recruiting, in hiring, in engaging, in training. I mean there is just a huge need for not only our technology in the HCM space, but our over 650 HR specialists, who are there to help them with those things. Bryan Bergin : Okay. And then as we think about fiscal 2023 and the forecast you built, can you unpack, within Management Solutions, specifically, are you still anticipating ASO retirement and some of these other areas to grow double digits versus kind of the payroll and HCM? Can you just help us with the underlying business areas in that segment and how you are thinking about growth in 2023? Efrain Rivera : Yeah. It\u2019s about right. I think that we see strong demand in those areas continuing through 2023. Obviously, on the HCM side, which we haven\u2019t said specifically, but which is implicit, you are not going to see the macro uplift in terms of the number of employees on the payroll. That just is part of the recovery from the pandemic, that\u2019s normalized partly based on some of the things that Marty has said. But demand for all of the other Management Solution services is still very, very robust, I would say, and we are very bullish on all of those other businesses. Martin Mucci : Yeah. The other thing that we hadn\u2019t mentioned yet, is that the work that we did, I mentioned employee retention tax credits in the Paycheck Protection loans. The employee retention tax credit service, that we really -- the team has really got down this to a very tight process and we were very successful in getting $8 billion between those credits and other credits to our clients. That has helped actually spur additional sales where they said, hey, now that you have given me all this value, I think the average employee retention tax credit was around $180,000 per pretty small business at times. That generated a need to say, hey, help let me try your HR service, let me do some other things. And we see that continue that will be continued to have success with ERTC in this year. We are already off to a good start this year. So a lot of clients are still finding a huge benefit from getting that government subsidy. Bryan Bergin : All right. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Thanks. Martin Mucci : Okay. You are welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: Thanks for taking my question this morning. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the sort of mix of your sales channels. I know the digital is clearly a highlight of the model. I am just curious in terms of how the various contributions from your different sales channels have trended over time? Martin Mucci : John, do you want to? John Gibson : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. As you can imagine, we have continued to use and seen digital sales continue to increase particularly in the pandemic. What I would tell you, both in terms of our share payroll.com and paychex.com, we have seen good attach rate there and good traction there. But I would also say, really across all of our sales channels we have seen very strong demand characteristics and we are finding clients doing more hybrid shopping. So starting off, maybe on paychex.com and then ending up in a discussion about how we can help them with ERTC and then other products and services. So I think our sales team has done a very good job of pivoting when the pandemic hit, adjusting to the new reality of how people are buying, and we continue to see and find ways that we can adapt that to drive not only more sales, but also sales productivity. That\u2019s the other thing that we have seen really increased with this. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And also if you wouldn\u2019t mind commenting on the competitive environment kind of coming out of the pandemic, I am curious if you perceive any changes, whether you are running into fewer competitors out there in the marketplace or more or how would you characterize how the competitive landscape is evolved? Martin Mucci : Yeah. It\u2019s. Marty. I will start. I think we are seeing it fairly consistent. Although, I would say that, things like the ability to offer the PEP plan and retirement, we were the first out of the gate with the PEP plan. We have had great success with the pooled employer plan for retirement. Other competitors have not offered that yet, not all competitors. So we really jumped the market on that one and did very well. I think, again, if you go back to us going to the client and prospect and saying, hey, we have employment retention tax credits that we think you can receive and let me go through that. We have jumped the gun over a lot of competition with that. I am surprised that the lack frankly of participation in that market. We have done very well with that which has helped our sales and bring value to prospects in current clients. So, I think, generally, the competitive environment is the same, but I actually -- but I also think that some of our product improvements and introductions have really positioned us a little bit stronger. I think particularly in the mid-market, mid-market that we haven\u2019t been as strong, I think, if you went back four years, five years ago, is we want it to be the introduction of the products over the last three years really positioned us, they have a really strong sales response to this last year and it\u2019s continuing into the first quarter. So we are feeling very good about the mid-market in particular. Ramsey El-Assal: Got it. All right. Thank you very much. Martin Mucci : Okay. Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Ramsey. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : Good morning, guys. I just wanted to start on HR management. I know you mentioned increased attach rates there and I am wondering if you can provide any quantification perhaps on that front for certain products that are driving that dynamic. John Gibson : Yeah. Hey, Jason. Hi. We will update the number of clients in the 10-K. So you will see that. We are approaching -- we are between 40,000 and 50,000 clients. You will see pretty strong double-digit growth in the number of clients there too. We will give you an exact number that you can look at when we file the 10-K in a few weeks. Martin Mucci : And John mentioned, I think that, we have hit over 2 million worksite employees in the HR space between our products in HR outsourcing and also a great attachment things like time and attendance. So we have been -- even something that we don\u2019t talk about as much time and attendance, we have introduced the new latest technology Iris Scan Clock. These are clocks whether you are wearing a mask or not, you don\u2019t -- they are non-touch, their kiosk that your just use your iris, your eyes the scan between that in the mobile punch in and punch out. We have seen very good attachment in time and attendance. When you have time and attendance and Flex, you now can use Pre-Check. So Pre-Check is now sending a notice, as I said to employees and saying, okay, you -- we have got you recording this many hours of working. This is your check. Do you see any issues with it? If you don\u2019t see issues, let us know that you confirmed it. If you have issues, let your employer know. We are seeing about 5% of the time that they are finding some issue that the employer, their employer didn\u2019t catch something right and that\u2019s resolving the issue before the payrolls cut, that is huge benefits. So you are seeing more attachment and use again by employees of clients and so the attachment of time and attendance and Pre-Check and retirement, all those things are making better retention and we are seeing attachment go up. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Thanks for that. I wanted to ask follow-up just on float income, it looks like that\u2019s forecasted to be up about $30 million year-over-year and assuming you get 100% flow-through on that. It looks like that would drive about 60 bps of margin expansion if our math is right and that would basically get you to the midpoint or roughly the midpoint of your margin guide for fiscal 2023, which would kind of suggest flattish margins in the core business. So I wanted to check on all that, if you agree with that general assessment? And also, I guess, just wondering if you can remind us a bit on duration of the portfolio, just given the magnitude and trajectory of rate hikes, perhaps, some would have thought even a bigger increase in float income for this upcoming year? Thanks. Efrain Rivera : Yeah. Interesting math. I think -- I wouldn\u2019t probably dispute the math, Jason. I would say that, the only comment I would make with respect to looking at the business that way is that, when you put a plan together what you are doing is making choices around a lot of different investments, even in a plan where we choose to increase margins 50 basis points. There are investment choices being made in that process. So while I think your math is probably not far off, that doesn\u2019t indicate that there isn\u2019t leverage -- underlying leverage in the business. It\u2019s just that we chose to deploy that in different parts of the business, could ahead greater flow-through some of it was some of the choices that we made with respect to wages and other items that we discussed previously. The second thing I\u2019d say, on everything we do, especially in the area of how we look at the portfolio, there is an element of conservatism in the way we think about it. This is an unusual year in the sense that the fed has said certain things, they change it, but they have been saying certain things and we have to incorporate the outlook that they have given to the extent that that changes, then we would come back and have different discussions, which could in some ways impact other parts of the P&L. But we will have to walk through that when we get there. We have ways to get more leverage if we choose that -- choose to use it. Then the final point is that, right now the duration is a little bit over three and our portfolio is positioned about half and half short-term and long-term. We have a lot of levers to pull there if we want to address duration on the portfolio either go longer or even shorter if we wanted to. So I wouldn\u2019t quibble with your math. I just would quibble with your conclusion a little bit about the underlying leverage in the business. Jason Kupferberg : Good color. I appreciate that. Thanks, Efrain. Efrain Rivera : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Hi, guys. Good morning. Efrain, how would you compare the preliminary guidance for fiscal year 2023, I think, you gave last quarter high single-digit revenue growth of 50 basis points of margin expansion with the detailed guidance. Just wanted to figure out if there were some adjustments you made either due to macro or some other factors? Efrain Rivera : Yeah. I\u2019d say, Bryan, kind of this -- if -- I was looking at it. I think we said approximately 7% or so. So this is a little bit stronger. The thing that, I called out, 3Q was, we knew ERTC was not going to recur. I call that out is 1% of this year\u2019s revenues. So that was a little bit of a hurdle that we were going to have to overcome. I think we have overcome that to significant degree, although it won\u2019t be as high as it was last year. The other factor really was around what happens with employment levels. That really is the tough part. Marty called that out. There is demand there for people, but there are unfortunately not as many people to fill those jobs. So what we are seeing by the way in the market is more creative use, things like part-time employees to fill jobs that otherwise would have been filled by full-time. That\u2019s not a bad thing for us from a wage perspective, but it\u2019s a little bit different than the way maybe you would have thought about it two years or three years ago. And then the final point is that. Look, the fed and you are looking at this just like we are. There is a lot of variability there, let\u2019s just put it that way. And so we haven\u2019t assumed anything beyond about 3.25% increase. The back half of the year is going to be very interesting from our perspective just in terms of what happens with -- whether there is a soft landing or not. So, we tried to create a plan that gets us through what we understand the current environment to be. And then, so this set of -- this guidance that you see here is a little bit stronger on the interest side than it was -- than we were and we said this since March, April, but because the fed\u2019s changed some of its thinking. Hey, I -- having said all of that, that word solid basically said, a lot of stuff could change. So we will uptake you. But I would say, in terms of the macro, it\u2019s probably changeable as any of the 11 or 12 plans that have been involved with here. Bryan Keane : Got it. Got it. And then just at a high level as, there\u2019s a lot of worry about a movement towards an economic slowdown and a recession. How does the model hold up, just on a high level in the recessionary environment or what are some of the variables that could impact the model, if we do see a recession in the U.S. and global? Efrain Rivera : Yeah. I think we called out in the comments. I think in Marty\u2019s, where we would see it, obviously is, you would see less clients processing. That\u2019s the first part that you see even before you saw slowdown in demand. But there is an interesting offset, Bryan, that we saw during the pandemic is that, it actually sometimes retention picks up in those kinds of environment. So what\u2019s the net of that, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball on that. I think it would help to offset some of the softness on the revenue side. And it depends also what\u2019s happening with interest rates, if interest rates remain at current levels or because of a slowdown, the fed decides, well, we are going to just ratchet them down, that would have an immediate impact from a revenue standpoint. I think if it\u2019s gradual we will manage through it and I think we certainly will manage through it on. We have a good shot at managing through on the bottomline. I think that we are prepared to handle that, if it\u2019s abrupt it\u2019s really tough to manage through those kinds of situations. Bryan Keane : Got it. Very helpful. Thanks guys. Efrain Rivera : Thanks. Martin Mucci : Thanks. Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Bryan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on that last comment you made Efrain, maybe spend a bit more time if you could on the flexibility of the expense base in a more challenging economic environment, where some of the areas where you have a bit more leeway to manage that bottomline relative to an environment that you have been in here over the past year or two where margins are at very strong levels? Efrain Rivera : Well, I\u2019d say, three things. So the first thing is, in an environment like this, you have to have the appropriate level of areas in the P&L to go, if you see a slowdown and we assume that we will manage through the current environment as it is and if it gets a little bit worse, we can handle that. So we have taken appropriate precautions is what I would say on that. That\u2019s the first thing. Second thing is that, we have a unique model where we -- and we do this quite a bit. We don\u2019t talk about it, but we do it. To the extent that the client base doesn\u2019t flex up in the way we do. We simply don\u2019t do the hiring that we expect to do. So, if we don\u2019t do the hiring, then you get the benefit of the 60% to 65% of -- on the 60% to 65% of the wages that are in the plan. And then the third thing is, we have flexibility in terms of adjustments on the portfolio to address duration depending on what we are seeing in terms of the macro environment. I think with those tools, if you will, in the toolkit and there are others, by the way, we should be able to manage through at least any of the environment that are right in front of us. There is certainly environments that could prove a lot more challenging. I\u2019d just point this out one thing is, the history is no guide. But in terms of precedent, I remember being here in April of 2021, when everyone was gone and the stock went down to $48 and everyone thought that we were not going to be able to manage through. I would say, history has shown that to be incorrect. Martin Mucci : Yeah. And I think the other thing, during some of those times that could -- during depending on the recession, there will be a need for even more need some -- for some many clients for HR support. How do I manage my costs down? How do I -- and I think we showed during the pandemic that we could respond to that very well. So we are really quite broad in the way that if it\u2019s -- the economy is growing fast and you need to hire and you need growth and you need to help with your HR, we are there to help you with the technology and the people to support you. If things turn and it\u2019s a recession and you got to manage people out or cost down, we have the products, the technology and the people to help you do that as well and I think we showed that as Efrain said in the pandemic when people thought, jeez, I don\u2019t know, will they be able to keep their margins, we did extremely well. And so we have been able -- we have learned a lot from that and frankly probably got a few more levers out of the pandemic that we could use during a recessionary period, which is one obviously not hiring, as Efrain mentioned, but also drive some other costs out through the fact that we have very remote hybrid workforces now that give you more flexibility even than before and where you hire too. Andrew Nicholas : Great. No. That\u2019s all very helpful. Thank you. And then for the fourth quarter, just a quick question there that I want to coming up, can you talk a little bit more on kind of the performance of the PEO business specifically relative to the insurance within that segment? Thank you. Efrain Rivera : So you mean insurance in the PEO or insurance as part of part of the PEO revenue stream? Andrew Nicholas : Yeah. The latter. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Do you want to\u2026 Martin Mucci : Yeah. Do you want, John. Efrain Rivera : I think. Martin Mucci : Yeah. Take it. John Gibson : Yeah. I think -- so just how I understand the question, you are talking about the attachment of insurance within the PEO and how the insurance is performing. Andrew Nicholas : Yeah. I guess, I am just -- within that segment, if you could just kind of break down the PEO business relative to the insurance business on standalone basis\u2026 John Gibson : Yeah. Yeah. Andrew Nicholas : That would be helpful. John Gibson : Yeah. So, I would say this, I think in the last call we talked about that the PEO business continues to support very well, double-digit growth, insurance slightly below that growth rate. Again, but that\u2019s really the tale of two cities. I would say again, back what we said, strong demand for clients to increase benefits to attract and keep employees they had, particularly in the small segment where they are trying to compete against larger employers, they have to be able to put together a portfolio of benefits that are going to attract and keep their employees. So we are in -- health and benefits, we continue to see good growth there and good demand there. PNC, again it\u2019s been a soft market for long time. So that\u2019s a bit more of a rate issue, but still see good attachment there -- historical attachment that we have always seen in our base. So still strong performance of the PEO, insurance right behind it, predominantly led by the demand for health and benefits. Martin Mucci : And the other thing I mentioned in my comments was the broad -- in the PEO, we worked really hard, John\u2019s team have broaden the PEO offering. So it\u2019s not just about health and dental envision now, it\u2019s really, as John said, this broader offering that the PEO can bring to small businesses in particular to say, hey, you can offer other things in insurance and you can offer more mental health support that is very hot right now and you can offer other plans that you would not be able to do by yourself. So that is really supported the PEO growth with the creativity that the team has shown in the offerings that we can give them. John Gibson : Yeah. That\u2019s what I thought maybe the other part of the question was. The attachment that we saw in the PEO and the attachment and generally we are seeing from our clients, as Marty said, 401(k), health and benefits, gravitating towards these technology tools that they want to be able to provide their employees. Those things have really been across the Board very, very well received and so in our comments, we stated, it\u2019s one of the things that we have seen now the opportunity for us to even add to that attachment. So when you think about now we are going to add a whole other set of voluntary benefits that we are going to go back and be able to offer to all of our PEO and all of our insurance clients over the course of the open enrollment period, which will start in October, and those are all will generate revenue. So, again, offering more benefits to the clients and their employees is another way that not only does that help the retention, but it also helps the revenue as well. We are seeing good demand in the marketplace there. Efrain Rivera : Yeah. Sorry. Andrew, the -- as John said, the revenue growth on the insurance side absent lower than PEO based on the fact that workers\u2019 comp continues to be a very, very side of the market over a number of years. Andrew Nicholas : No. That\u2019s helpful. You did a much better job answering it tonight. I didn\u2019t ask it. So I appreciate it. Efrain Rivera : No. No. Not at all. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Good morning. Efrain Rivera : Good morning. Kartik Mehta : Marty, maybe, I know talked a little bit about recession and Efrain you gave a good answer on how you might manage a business. I am wondering, based on some of the slowdowns as you have seen, would you manage Paychex any different? I mean would you think that you could continue hiring or investing? Would this time be all different than in the past based on what you have learned? Martin Mucci : Well, Kartik, right now, as I mentioned, we are not really seeing that slowdown. So, yeah, I mean, we really got behind at the beginning of last year in hiring, because it was difficult on the service side in particular and we actually made great headway in the last half of the year John and the HR team to get ahead of that and we are actually over-staffed right now a little bit going into the fiscal year. So we are very pleased with that. So we are making, still strong hiring decisions. The investments that we made in compensation and benefits are attracting now. We are getting back on track and attracting more not only service, but sales individuals and our retention is looking better. So, yeah, I don\u2019t think, I think what we learned as I mentioned out of the pandemic though, was that we could manage in a lot of different ways and more remote and hybrid work, handling sales differently, there is more flexibility in where those sales forces are and how they are selling, more digital sales are coming in through the marketplace and we are well prepared for that. So, yeah, I think you are always learning and we certainly learned during the pandemic and we were very successful. It\u2019s all about having the right people in place and making those right decisions and I think we have made some good ones. Obviously, we are very pleased with a record breaking year that we had and we are certainly well set up for fiscal 2023 to have another one, so. Kartik Mehta : And then just, Efrain, one of the areas that I think you have had success is in the programs like California kind of retirement mandates that they have had for SMBs. I am wondering how successful that plan has been and maybe you can talk about if you continue to expect growth in that business. Martin Mucci : Yeah. I will take that, Kartik. It\u2019s Marty. I think that was very successful. We were a little early in some of the advertising last summer because the mandate, business don\u2019t always respond to mandates that are going to have a penalty effective really this month and so we were a little bit early on that. But what we found was, the advertising that we did had really generated a lot of understanding that Paychex is a retirement provider to small business and even fighting against free, California had a very basic retirement higher rate plan for free. We have done very well. So retirement, we have had the fastest growth in retirement -- in retirement sales in California, obviously in our history. And so we see the approach that we made there, maybe we have learned a little on timing of marketing and advertising, but the approach that we made there has been very successful and we think that will certainly carry to other states and maybe even a federal mandate, if it comes out on retirement as well in the Secure Act and so forth. Kartik Mehta : Thank you. Thanks, Marty. Appreciate it. Martin Mucci : All right, Kartik. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Peter Christiansen with Citi. Peter Christiansen : Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for the question and giving a chance here. I was just wondering, I know you called it out a little bit before, activity in the staffing industry, your staffing clients, I know sometimes that\u2019s been a leading indicator at both ends of the cycle. Just wondering if you could dig into -- if you can dig into a little bit of the color you are seeing there and maybe some implications that you are thinking about around that? Efrain Rivera : Yeah. That\u2019s a really interesting question and some of you are staffing analyst. So I differ a little bit to you, but here\u2019s what we do, just to level set with everyone. What we do and we have had a very, very successful year, this year is to provide funding for typically small and medium size, some larger staffing firms. So we have a window into what is happening with staffing trends in the business. And right now the staffing businesses are doing very, very well. So there\u2019s a lot of demand for services. You can argue, well, why is that? It seems that in portions of the economy, certain portions of the economy. In skilled labor, you are seeing a lot of demand. I -- many of you probably know this, but skilled occupations like nursing and other technical disciplines, there\u2019s a lot of temp labor that is used in that part of the business. But what\u2019s been surprising, I would say, over the last three months to six months has been the rebound and what\u2019s called light industrial. So that\u2019s more typically blue collar work. It\u2019s -- the demand is robust and it\u2019s projected to continue to do that through the end of the year. It could be argued that perhaps people are starting to position themselves for a more flexibility on the workforce. But we don\u2019t have any indications of that. What we know is that the number in absolute terms of temp workers is up and that we are benefiting from that demand. Peter Christiansen : Okay. That\u2019s helpful, Efrain. And then, again, back on things like the PEP plan, where you just had phenomenal growth there and I realize like products -- attach products like that, I think, certainly help things like retention and value-based pricing for sure. But is there any way you could frame what type of contribution, a product like that has had overall growth, I guess, in the last year? Efrain Rivera : Yeah. So I called it out, because I think it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s not. I am going to characterize it two ways. The first way I\u2019d say, it\u2019s been a little bit above 1% of revenue for the year. So it obviously was a great product and but I would highlight something that Marty said, the great thing about a product like that is the profound impact that has on clients and we had a review of it. If you saw the stories, they are really, really important and they are important not just because you feel good about them. That\u2019s good. It\u2019s good to feel good. But the reality is that it had a lot of impact on the clients that got it and the testimonials are amazing. But I think the second part of it is, Marty mentioned that, there is still opportunity in the PEP. So we expect that this year we are going to continue to get a benefit, not the same level of benefit we got last year, but we will continue to get. Martin Mucci : Efrain, just to clarify, I think, you used term ERTC, he might have said PEP. Did you say, PEP, Peter? Peter Christiansen : Yeah. Efrain Rivera : He is talking about the PEP. Martin Mucci : Okay. Everybody, I apologize. Yeah. PEP is a little bit different. So the final point. I would say on that simply is that, whether it\u2019s PEP or ERTC, there is a set or a suite of services that we provide to clients that really are very important in terms of cementing a relationship with Paychex. So this year it\u2019s ERTC. Last year it was PEP. We are constantly on the lookout or opportunities to cement that relationship with clients, so that what I say, sorry. John? John Gibson : Yeah. I know\u2026 Martin Mucci : He would talking about ERTC, apologize. John Gibson : Yeah. I would also probably add to that, Peter. Those things are cousins in somewhat of an innovation machine that we are driving with our nearly 700 HR professionals who are out there talking to our clients on a daily basis. And I say that because for whatever reason, other companies are deciding not to be as supportive in these tax credit areas and in the PEP plan, which is really resonating with small business owners because of some of the complexities that if reduces from a traditional 401(k) plan and so, again, I look at this very closely. Those are two products that when I look at the clients that are attaching those, we see a measurable improvement in our overall retention and more ability to price. Price, that you said the price value package that we can get from those clients is much good as well and they are appreciative because there\u2019s not a lot of other places, they can go to get that assistance. So it\u2019s a combination of us leveraging our technology and then also having the individuals in the field to help really advice and support them in building a package and getting that done. It\u2019s really resonating and again that they are just real appreciative. Marty, I mean, Efrain mentioned the stories, I mean I have people calling me and thanking me for saving their business with ERTC and we hear that -- hear the stories about how well the PEP plan is helping our clients. Martin Mucci : Yeah. Just, sorry about that. I heard PEP and\u2026 John Gibson : Yeah. Martin Mucci : \u2026 I interpreted to be ERTC. The other thing I would say that the quantification of that is that, it\u2019s part of the growth and management solutions. If you take what happened to our retirement business, pre-PEP and post-PEP, we took that business from kind of mid single-digit to upper single digits and approaching 10% growth on a revenue basis and it\u2019s been really driven on the back of the ability to offer a PEP solution. So, sorry about the digression into ERTC. Peter Christiansen : No. No worry. That\u2019s great color and John I really like the innovation machine cousins. I might still that. Last one from me, Efrain, you mentioned it earlier before or maybe John did, price to value losses have been really minimal. But you are seeing ramping up discounting and promotional activity from some peers in the market. Just overall your sense for across the market for pricing elasticity and whether that\u2019s different pre-pandemic versus today? Martin Mucci : I think, it feels -- we feel pretty good, obliviously, our prices. I think, Efrain I mentioned earlier on the price increase toward the higher end, but it depends on the product and the bundle and so forth. But I think we feel very good about the fact that other than how strong the recession impacts that, but right now we feel very good that the things that John is talking about that we have been saying, those products are driving much more retention and less focus on price. The price value -- losses have come down as John mentioned and it\u2019s been very much because of the value that we are adding, I think with the other products, the value that we added by giving -- by bringing in employee retention tax credit to them or helping them for -- their PPP loan forgiven very quickly and easily. Those things have really impacted the price elasticity in the fact that, hey, I am -- this is driving value for me and therefore it\u2019s well worth it. And we really -- I think we really as a company sees the opportunity during the pandemic to show much more value than we probably had in the past. We took that opportunity that we were given that we could be there for them through a difficult pandemic time to help them retain people, hire people, handle their teams remotely with paperless digital solutions, all of that really benefited us and is continuing as we kind of come out of that period as well. Peter Christiansen : Thank you, gentlemen. I appreciate the detail color. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Martin Mucci : Thanks. All right, Peter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Jonathan Lee : Hey, guys. This is Jonathan on for James. How does your strategy around M&A change in recessionary environment, particularly if we were to get a material drop private valuation than you see attractive opportunities? Martin Mucci : Well, we would love that. We are always on the hunt. And I think the valuations have not caught up on that private side at all that we have seen. We still see some nice opportunities in various markets that we have talked about in the past, but the valuations don\u2019t seem that quite happened yet. So, we are expecting, typically it does kind of follow behind the public side of it. We will see what happens. But with the cash that Efrain talked about, we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that come up, whether it\u2019s a recession or just kind of a repricing on some of the valuations, that I think will happen, because you can see it already in the private markets where there is a lot of cost cutting and a lot of much more conservative approaches, things to get themselves positioned better to make sure they don\u2019t lose so much on the valuation. So, we are watching very closely. We are continuing to talk to those companies that we have talked to in the past and we will keep an eye in valuations, but I think it gives even a better opportunity. Jonathan Lee : Got it. Appreciate that perspective. And you called out further investment in product development and IT, where are you focused on improving from a product portfolio or tech perspective? Martin Mucci : Yeah. I think it just continues to be from a digital standpoint, particularly I think on the sales side. You just -- it\u2019s obvious that the buying process is much more about being able to do it themselves. I think John mentioned earlier, that it is -- it\u2019s still a combination of doing the research, some going through and buying themselves and we have that availability, whether it\u2019s Flex or Sure. And then there is also those that go so far and then need a sales rep or want a sales rep involved, whether it\u2019s digital format, whether it\u2019s on the web or whether it\u2019s in person or bringing in a sales engineer on the web or in person for a demo. So I think those investments, we -- those investments will continue. Product investments also -- roadmaps are planned out for the next two years to layout much more flexibility and the way we pay. Certainly from a pay access and pay and demand, we offer that today through partnership is well. But I think that will continue to expand, earned wage access, is something that we see continuing to expand. And just the overall product availability and the ability also to choose who we want to be connected with. So we are very busy from an API standpoint, expanding our set of APIs to, if you want to keep certain portions of the business, but really gain the power of Flex HR, you have that opportunity. So a lot of investment levels have continued and actually we are very proud of the fact that we can produce the margins that we show and Efrain has talked about and guided to, why we are still significantly investing in a digital product set. Jonathan Lee : Thanks for the color, guys. Efrain Rivera : Okay. You are welcome. Martin Mucci : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Mark Marcon : Hey. Good morning, Marty, Efrain and John. Wondering, this question has been asked a little bit, but I want to ask in a different way. If you hadn\u2019t -- if you didn\u2019t see all of the macro headlines that are out there and you are, obviously, you are all experienced, you are all aware of the impact of higher rates ultimately from a macro perspective. If we didn\u2019t see higher rates and if you didn\u2019t see all the macro headlines, how would the guidance have been different? Martin Mucci : You are more on this. Efrain Rivera : I would say this, Mark, if I just -- you can disaggregate that question and say, I am looking at indicators. So we are looking at the indicators, because not me, it\u2019s a team of people that are looking at it, and we say, these are the indicators we are presented with before we put together a plan. It\u2019s just hard to say that the plan would be that much different than the plan that we saw. You would have lower interest rates. You might push a little bit more on the operating side. But it wouldn\u2019t be significantly different. I just remind people -- I shared this with the leadership team. Pre-pandemic, leading into the pandemic, we were at about a 5% CAGR growth rate, a little bit we were trending up, but if you take the end of the pandemic, our CAGR was about 5% on the topline and in 10% on the bottomline. We come out of the pandemic growing faster than that, because going into the pandemic before all of these things occurred, all of the pandemic-related impacts occurred, we have made a lot of investments in automating, digitalizing, digitizing, you name it, we did it all and we are still doing that. And so -- the business was on an uptrend and so I would have expected, if we were looking at this year that a lot of those actions that are part of the DNA of the way Marty and the team has operated the company would continue. And you deliver something like upper single-digit growth, pretty close to double-digit bottomline, which by the way, there is a long track record of doing in the company. So, I guess, that\u2019s my answer to the question. Martin Mucci : Yeah. And I would just add, Mark, when you look at it. So if you assume interest rates go up and obviously we -- there is a tailwind as Efrain mentioned from the interest rate. On the other hand, that could slow the housing market some and there\u2019s a lot of small business around housing. So that\u2019s offsetting it. So there\u2019s offsets that we had to take into account is -- that we take into account as well. And I think, overall, as Efrain said, we have really come up through the pandemic and out of the pandemic, with a higher growth rate that\u2019s been consistent whether the interest rates before the interest rates were changing. We will take the tailwind, but we also know that there is some risk that comes with that for small business development and growth. Mark Marcon : That\u2019s great, Marty. I mean, I just -- my sense is that you probably took into account the macro headlines and probably were a little bit more conservative than you would have been. I do not see all those macro headlines, is that a correct assumption? Efrain Rivera : Hey, Mark. Let me answer it this way, so just to be more specific. The challenge that we have and I think we have been very transparent with the street, is that we tell you what we -- we tell you exactly what we know one would say and when it isn\u2019t right, we call it out and I am not saying other competitors don\u2019t, of course, they do. The issue is, we have a fair amount of consistency and predictability in the business, not just because that\u2019s the way the business is, but that\u2019s the way we run the business. So, the specific answer to your question is, we can see the first half of the year. We feel pretty good about where the first half of the year is. Here\u2019s where it gets cloudier. It\u2019s the second half of the year where it\u2019s a little bit cloudier and there is macro factors that will impact that to Marty\u2019s point, we had to take into effect the fact that we are not going to have the same kind of second half of the year. The macro isn\u2019t lining up exactly the way it was this year. So we looked at the first half. We feel pretty good about that. The second half as we go through the year, we will update it. I think we have got a pretty good view of what it looks like based on everything we know now. But I don\u2019t need to remind you that even the fed is struggling to understand what the macro indicators they are looking at. Mark Marcon : Yeah. Understood. And then, hey, with regards to bookings, can you breakdown the bookings that you ended up seeing with regards to the fourth quarter and how the pipeline is looking and specifically how would you characterize micro versus SBS versus mid-market? And then, to what extent are you seeing growth in terms of new logos versus upsells? Martin Mucci : Yeah. I think, across the Board, pretty strong midmarket in particular that we have called out a couple of times, is really been strong. I think we have done very well in last fiscal year and starting off this first quarter, as well as continued. I think the execution on the sales side, the product and everything is really driven very strong results in the midmarket and we feel we are doing very well against the competition that I think might be struggling a little bit with the things that we are putting out. And the small market continues to be okay. I think they are the ones that are probably struggling a little bit more and then on the micro, continues to be very strong. Sure, in particular, continue to have very solid growth and we had growth on the Flex side. So really across the Board I think in good shape and heading into the quarter, frankly, in good shape. Sales so fully staffed, a little bit of growth from the rep side, but across the Board, I mean, sales had their best year ever and that was pretty much across the Board, whether you are talking about the payroll side, retirement, HR, ASO, PEO, really most, every area, so. Mark Marcon : Great. And what percentage of the bookings are upsells versus new logos? Martin Mucci : Oh! I would say, particularly on the payroll side, it\u2019s still about the same. I\u2019d say roughly half is new business and we really haven\u2019t -- new businesses have slowed somewhat, but we have still had a very good track record on winning new business. It\u2019s still about 50% of the sales coming in on the payroll side. Mark Marcon : Terrific. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay. Thank you, Mark. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will come from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Scott Wurtzel : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask on margins, we thought the guide for the full year was pretty encouraging, but just wanted to look at the first half. It looks like you are guiding for adjusted operating margins to be down a little bit relative to the first half last year. So just wondering what the puts and takes around that, was it -- is it mostly due to sort of the wage inflation, increased headcount that you have sort of taken more of there any other impacts there? Efrain Rivera : Yeah. What you are seeing, when you dig underneath that is that, in the first half of the year, our margins were stronger in part because our employment levels were lower. So I kept saying last year that we were adequately staffed and not fully staffed and now we are fully staffed in the first half of the year in addition to the wage actions that we took. So that has an impact of driving margin in the first half down and then you get the benefit in the back half. Scott Wurtzel : Got it. Got it. Thank you. And then, just, sorry, if I may have missed this. I know it was discussed, but is there any way you can maybe unpack on the client fund interest income guidance, just what\u2019s the puts and takes between sort of like balance growth and what you are expecting on yield? Efrain Rivera : Yeah. We are expecting modest balance growth. We have had pretty strong balance growth this year. So really -- the growth is really being driven by our anticipation what the fed is going to do between now and end of the year. So it\u2019s really more interest rate driven. But we are expecting client balance growth to based on wage inflation. Scott Wurtzel : Got it. Thanks, guys. Efrain Rivera : Yeah. You are welcome. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s call. Martin Mucci : All right. Operator : I would like to turn it back over to our speakers. Martin Mucci : All right. Thank you. At this point, we will close the call. If you are interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it\u2019s archived for approximately 90 days and thank you for taking the time to participate in our very strong fourth quarter earnings release conference call and your interest in Paychex. I hope you all enjoy the safe and happy summer. Talk to you soon. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call and we appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

Later, you will have an opportunity to ask questions during the question and answer session. You may register to ask a question by pressing star and one on your touchtone phone. Please note this call may be recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn today\u2019s program over to Martin Mucci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex. Please go ahead. Martin Mucci : Thank you Gretchen, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings release. Joining me today are John Gibson, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. I do want to start off by saying that all of us are thinking of everyone in the path of Hurricane Ian that is approaching Florida at this time. Certainly our employees, our clients, and everyone else in those areas, we hope are safe. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2022. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days, and this teleconference is of course being broadcast over the internet and will be archived and available for approximately 90 days. We\u2019ll start today\u2019s call with an update on business highlights for the first quarter, Efrain will then review our financial results and outlook for fiscal 2023, and then we\u2019ll open it up for your questions. I will start out by acknowledging that this will be my last earnings call in my role as CEO of Paychex. On August 24, we announced I am retiring of CEO effective October 14 - that\u2019s after our fiscal 2022 annual meeting of stockholders; however, I will remain my role as Chairman of the Board. John Gibson on the call today, our current President and Chief Operating Officer, will assume the role of President and CEO. John has been a member of the executive leadership team since 2013 and has been instrumental in the success of Paychex during this tenure. We have executed on a long term succession plan and I\u2019m confident that John is the right person to lead Paychex into its next phase of growth. Really, many best days ahead of us. I want to thank all of you also, you directly for your interest and coverage of Paychex, some of you for more than two decades, and for your good questions and feedback over my 12 years as Chief Executive Officer.  I also want to publicly thank Efrain. You know, everyone knows he\u2019s one of the best CFOs in the business and we\u2019ve done over 40 quarterly calls together, and more than a CFO, Efrain has really been a leader on our executive team who provides not only great counsel but is known for his intelligence, his integrity, and also music trivia - you can try that out sometime. Fiscal 2023 is off to a great start with double digit growth in both revenue and earnings compared to the same quarter last year. We had a record level of first quarter sales with strong trends continuing in the mid market, retirement and HR outsourcing in particular. We have had continued success in the selling of our suite of innovative products from HCM technology to HR solutions that help businesses become more efficient and address complex HR issues in a challenging time for many businesses. We continue to regularly monitor our key leading indicators for signs of changes to the macroeconomic trends, and while we have seen some moderation in key issues, we have not yet seen any significant changes. As an example, the latest Paychex IHS Small Business Employment Watch showed that workers of U.S. small businesses continue to benefit from higher wages. New jobs continue to grow but at a more moderated pace and job growth at U.S. small businesses remains resilient even in the face of a tight labor market and inflation pressures. Employment levels at our existing clients have continued to increase as they\u2019re finding more people to fill those positions, consistent with these findings of our small business index.  I will now turn the call over to John and he will provide you with some highlights surrounding our technology and product suite and results. John? John Gibson : Okay, thank you Marty, and good morning everyone. It\u2019s a pleasure to be with you. Based on our recently released Pulse of HR survey, it\u2019s obvious that businesses of all sizes continue to be challenged with attracting and retaining talent, improving their operational efficiency, and working to increase their financial flexibility. Our continued investments in innovative HR technology combined with our unmatched HR expertise truly and uniquely positions us to help small businesses and midsized businesses navigate a very dynamic and challenging environment. Earlier this month, we attended the annual HR Technology Conference in Las Vegas, where once again Paychex demonstrated the latest of our innovations. We showcased significant enhancements to the Paychex Flex recruiting and applicant tracking experience, which is designed to digitally deliver candidates to clients faster and allow them to leverage mobile technology to recruit, screen and then on-board candidates in a unified and simple to use experience. Already, our digital on-boarding experience was utilized by over 1.7 million new hires in the last year alone. We also introduced our latest innovation, Paychex Voice Assist, and really this is a natural extension of the expansive and ever-growing and utilized self-service capabilities that we have at Paychex, and coupled with our award-winning Paychex pre-check offering which allows employees to further participate in the payroll process by reviewing their gross to net payroll calculations prior to payroll processing, Paychex Voice Assist now enables HR and payroll administrators and small business owners to manage their payroll and HR tasks while on the go through any Google Assistant-capable device. This provides a hands-free experience that includes voice recognition and verification security. I\u2019m proud that Paychex is the first HMC solutions provider to offer voice activated capabilities such as these.  Our technology offerings continue to garner national recognition. Paychex is proud to be recognized for the sixth - I repeat, the sixth consecutive year by NelsonHall, a global analyst and research firm, and they positioned us as a leader in its 2022 NEAT report for service providers. Paychex Flex was recognized for its comprehensive technology as one of the most advanced HR platforms that brings the power of benchmarking, data analytics, as well as digital service enablement to drive operational efficiency and improve the employee experience.  I also want to mention that we have once again, for the 12th consecutive year, been recognized as the nation\u2019s largest 401K record keeper by total number of plans by Plan Sponsor Magazine. We were also recognized by them as an industry leader in the number of new plans that we added in 2021. It\u2019s obvious that our retirement business continues to be an area of strength for us as many business owners and their employees are focused on financial wellness as a key benefit and issue. In addition, our pooled employer plan offering continues to gain traction in the marketplace with approximately 4,000 new plans on-boarded during the first quarter alone.  We continue to see strong demand for our employee retention tax credit service. This helps clients to maximize their eligible tax credits and thus provide them more financial flexibility. To date, we have helped over 45,000 clients secure over $8.6 billion in combined ERTC and paid leave tax credits. We continue to have the opportunity to educate more of our existing clients on the benefit of this service as well as leverage the service to attract new clients. We have started off the fiscal year \u201923 strong, and while there is uncertainty in the macro environment, our solutions and business model have in the past and continue today to prove their resilience. We help our clients to succeed under any macroeconomic conditions. We continue to focus our product road map on the needs of our clients and anticipate releasing further enhancements this fiscal year designed to continue to provide them a positive digital user experience and help them utilize HR technology to simplify their processes. Now before I turn the call over to Efrain, I\u2019d like to take a moment to say thank you - and yes, Marty, you\u2019re going to continue to hear this over and over again over the next couple weeks, but I want to say thank you to Marty for his tireless dedication and strong leadership of the company over the years, and for me personally for his mentorship and his friendship for the nearly decade that he and I have been working together. You know, under Marty\u2019s tenure as CEO, Paychex has more than doubled its revenue and transformed into a leading HCM technology solutions company. Today, Paychex is a tech company and it\u2019s a tech company because of Marty\u2019s vision and his leadership. Marty, it\u2019s been a pleasure to work alongside you, the leadership team, and the nearly 17,000 now employees at Paychex, and I look forward to continuing our relationship in our new roles. As I\u2019ve said many times and to many people, we\u2019re the same great company, it\u2019s the same great leadership team, it\u2019s the same great employees, we\u2019re just each playing a little different roles as we move forward. I know that our collective focus on our purpose, which is to help small and midsized businesses succeed, will continue to drive us in the future as it has in the past. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Efrain to discuss our first quarter financials. Efrain Rivera : Okay, thanks John, and good morning. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s commentary contains forward-looking statements that refer to future events and therefore involve risks. Refer to the customary disclosures. Let me start by providing key points for the quarter and finish with a review of fiscal 2023 outlook. As Marty and John already mentioned, Q1 was strong and our financial results for the first quarter included service and revenue and total revenue that increased 11% to $1.2 billion. Management solutions revenue increased 12% to $906 million, driven by higher client employment levels and revenue per client. Revenue per client was positively impacted by additional product penetration, HR ancillary services, largely our ERTC product, and price realization. We continue to see strong attachment of our HR solutions, retirement and time and attendance solutions. I\u2019ll note that the revenue from our ERTC service benefited our first quarter revenue by about 1% to 2%. While we had anticipated ERTC revenue would continue in fiscal 2023, strong execution both in sales and service allowed us to realize some of the revenue a bit earlier in the year. While ERTC was a tailwind to growth for the first quarter, its benefit will decline as the year progresses. For the full year, the impact will be marginal to growth. PEO and insurance solutions revenue increased 8% to $283 million, driven by growth in average worksite employees and PEO health insurance revenue. The rate of growth was tempered by a lower rate of health insurance enrollment in both the PEO and the insurance agency, together with continued softness in workers\u2019 compensation rates, so that really is a little bit more focused at the insurance agency, has more of an impact on the revenue there. Interest on funds held for clients increased 24% for the quarter to $18 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates along with growth in investment balances. Total expenses increased 11% to $711 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher headcount, wage rates, and general costs to support growth in our business. In addition, PEO direct costs increased due to higher medical plan enrollments compared to the same period last year. Op income increased 12% to $496 million with an operating margin of 41.1%, an expansion of 20 basis points over the prior year, a bit above where we anticipated it being in first quarter.  Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.9% compared to 24.9% in the prior year period. Both periods reflect discrete tax benefits related to employee stock-based comp payments; however, the prior year also reflected an increase in state taxes. Net income and diluted earnings per share both increased 14% to $379 million and $1.05 per share respectively. Adjusted net income increased 15% and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 16% for the quarter to $372 million and $1.03 per share respectively. Our financial position remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $1.3 billion, and our borrowings are at approximately $800 million as of the end of the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $364 million during the first quarter, a small decrease from the prior driven by fluctuations in working capital partially offset by higher net income, and we paid out quarterly dividends at $0.79 per share for a total of $285 million in the first quarter. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was a stellar 46%. Now I\u2019ll turn to our guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2023. Our current outlook incorporates our first quarter results and our view of the evolving macroeconomic landscape. One thing I want to emphasize as I walk through the guidance, we don\u2019t provide quarter-to-quarter guidance. What we try to do is give you a sense of where we anticipate the quarters will fall, so I\u2019d ask that you keep that in mind. The majority of our guidance remains unchanged from that provided in June, with the exception of an increase in our expected growth for adjusted earnings per share. Let me provide some color in certain areas as follows. Management solutions revenue is expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%, but now we anticipate it to be towards the upper end of the range. PEO and insurance solutions still expected to grow in the range of 8% to 10%, but we now anticipate it to be towards the lower end of the range. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $85 million to $95 million but is now again anticipated to be towards the upper end of the range. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 7% to 8% but, again based on what I just said, is anticipated to be towards the upper end of that range, and adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow in the range of 11% to 12%, an increase from the previous guidance of 9% to 10%. Just want everyone to remember, I\u2019m talking about adjusted diluted earnings per share. Turning to the second quarter, our current thoughts are that we anticipate revenue growth will be approximately 7% and we expect operating margins to be approximately 38%. Of course, all of this is subject to current assumptions which could change if there are significant changes to the macro environment, and we\u2019ll update you again on the second quarter call. I refer you to our investor slides on our website for more information. I\u2019d also like to take a moment to say thank you to Marty for his years of service to the company. It\u2019s been an incredible pleasure working alongside you, and I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. I can say that for all of the shareholders on the call, there was never a moment, never a conversation where putting the interests of shareholders didn\u2019t come first, and so I know that that will continue under John\u2019s leadership. The other thing I\u2019d like to say is that the company that we\u2019re reporting on today simply would not be where it is today without Marty\u2019s efforts. One other thing that I want to add too for the investors on the call, we filed a supplemental proxy statement this week relating to our say on pay proposal. We\u2019d ask that investors who own a position in Paychex take a look, read that closely. I\u2019m always available, the management team is always available for any calls that you\u2019d like to schedule to discuss that. So with that, let me turn it back over to Marty. Martin Mucci : Thanks John and Efrain. Thank you very much for the comments and for your updates, and also of course we wouldn\u2019t be where we are today as a company without our over 16,000 employees who have worked so tirelessly for our clients and for our shareholders. We\u2019ll now open it up for your questions and comments. Gretchen, open it up, please. Operator : [Operator instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Bryan, your line is open. Bryan Bergin : Hi, good morning. Thank you. Marty, John, congrats. Martin Mucci : Thanks Bryan. Bryan Bergin : Wanted to start here, if we could talk about--really thinking a little bit more around the moderation comment you mentioned on some of the KPIs and any changed view on macro assumptions in that fiscal \u201923 guide, particularly on client employee levels and retention. Martin Mucci : Yes, I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ll let John comment too, but I think what we\u2019re seeing in the moderation is, like on retention, I think that we\u2019re kind of heading back towards--we\u2019re still above from a revenue retention standpoint, we\u2019re still above pre-pandemic levels. On client retention, we\u2019re kind of normalizing back to a pre-pandemic. We kind of expected that - you know, there was a lot of new business growth, new start-up business growth over the last couple of years during the pandemic, and so you\u2019re seeing a few more of those go out of business and you\u2019re seeing a few more bankruptcies that way. The other thing that we\u2019re seeing in the small business index is while wages are going up, they\u2019re starting to slow down and moderate, so while job growth is still growing and moderating some for small businesses, wage growth is starting to moderate slightly, so that\u2019s maybe a good sign that some of the actions being taken by the Fed are working and maybe that will continue to improve. But other than that, sales continue to be very strong, so when you look at that side of it, we\u2019re at record levels of sales. We had a great first quarter in sales and clients are adding employees, so the moderation is probably more on the retention side normalizing but the number of employees being added and the sales are still very strong. John, anything you want to add to that? John Gibson : No, I would say I don\u2019t think there is anything we\u2019re seeing at this point that we\u2019d see as a sign of a recession. As Marty pointed out, there was moderation that we expected going into this year on retention because of the business charge, but when I look at it, employment levels continue to increase, we see that in our checks, we see that in worksite employees per customer. The labor market continues to be tight. Our business watch certainly showed that information. I would also point to our revenue retention is remaining at the record levels we\u2019ve seen before, so again we continue to see the fact that retention and the use of our products, when I look at the underlying pieces, clients are taking high value services from us, those things are creating more stickiness for those customers. Our price value losses continue to remain significantly below even the pre-pandemic levels, so again any moderation that we\u2019re seeing, I view as more of a normalization of what we saw anomaly going on during the pandemic. Bryan Bergin : Okay, thank you. Then just Efrain, for the 2Q rough targets that you provided here, can you just dig in a little bit more on the dynamics, first on growth as we think about moving from 1Q to 2Q, and then just on margin, the outperformance on margin in 1Q, are there added investments that come back into the model over the course of the year, particularly in 2Q? Efrain Rivera : Yes, a little bit. Let me just talk to that, because obviously the growth rate in 2Q is a little bit different. This year was always a little odd because the two highest growth quarters were the first and the last and the middle for different reasons, a little bit idiosyncratic to the processing--for a planned process ended up a little bit lower. In Q2, I\u2019d call out three things, Bryan, that are important. We don\u2019t anticipate that the level of ERTC I called out in the quarter will--the amount of growth contributed by ERTC will continue in the second quarter. Having said that, I don\u2019t know because I didn\u2019t think that was going to happen in the first quarter, so we could be a little bit more, but I\u2019m being a little bit cautious about what we think we will get, so you won\u2019t quite get--you won\u2019t get that level of uptick in growth in Q2. These comments are about Q2, by the way. We\u2019ll talk about the back half of the year when we get a little bit closer to the back half of the year. The second part is that we had, to the point--although there\u2019s been discussion about moderation, what was really interesting in the first quarter is that we had higher growth in what we\u2019d call check volume - pays per control, others call - than we anticipated in our plans. First quarter was actually fairly robust. Out of an abundance of caution, reading the same info you are reading, we think we\u2019re still going to get some benefit in Q2 but it won\u2019t be as pronounced as it was in the first quarter, so that will cause a little bit of a step-down. Then with respect to PEO, we called out some trends that are persisting around--PEO and insurance, around healthcare attachment that we think will continue into second quarter, that\u2019s going to drive growth a bit lower than we were. We\u2019re really consistent and some ways a little bit above what I said when we were in the fourth quarter call. That\u2019s really what\u2019s driving it - it really is more of a Q2 phenomenon on the investment side. The challenge for this year was we entered the year--in the first half of the year last year, we were really at much lower employment levels than we are currently, and so as you have a little bit of a step-down in revenue in Q2, or as you have a step-down in revenue in Q2, you still have relatively higher expense levels that normalize as we get into the back half of the year, and then we\u2019re making investments in marketing, product development, the normal things that you would make in a quarter, and that combines to kind of create a little bit of a lumpy Q2. Those are the key factors in terms of underlying dynamics - no change, and it\u2019s pretty much in line with what we anticipated. Bryan Bergin : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America. Jason, your line is open. Jason Kupferberg : Sorry, apologies. I was on mute. Well first of all, congrats to Marty and John. I did want to start with a question for Efrain, just on the EPS guidance raise. Efrain, is this just because you now think revenue and margin will both be at the higher end of your full year expectations? I know everything else is kind of unchanged, so just wanted to make sure we have the pieces there for EPS. Efrain Rivera : Yes, I think for the full year, we\u2019ll be a little bit ahead, I\u2019d say. I think it\u2019s more driven, Jason, by more mix. There\u2019s some revenue component to it and there\u2019s a mix component to it that\u2019s driving the EPS number. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, got it. Just the float income guidance for fiscal \u201923, I know it\u2019s unchanged - you\u2019re talking about being at the higher end. I guess maybe just given the magnitude and the speed of the Fed rate hikes, can you walk through some of the pieces there? Some people, I think, might have thought that that number would be moving a bit higher, but obviously there\u2019s portfolio duration and other variables to consider. That would be helpful. Efrain Rivera : Well Jason, thank you. Look, I\u2019m a little bit cautious and I think we could be accused of some conservatism there, but you\u2019re absolutely right. Just to get one level deeper and get a little bit more into the question that you\u2019re raising, I think the issue for us is at what point do you see the Fed raising and then you lock long based on duration? I don\u2019t have the great answer to that. I will say we\u2019re meeting basically every other week to decide what our outlook is on that. That could impact that number. I\u2019m looking not only at \u201923 and \u201924. You were here long enough to know when we wrote that cycle up and that had a bumpy cycle on the way down, and so I want to avoid that, even at the expense of maybe a little bit of upside this year, so we\u2019re trying to figure all that out. Then you\u2019re reading the same thing--you actually have better info than I do. One second, it looks like short term interest rates are going to go to X, and the next second someone says hey, I\u2019m a little bit concerned about that, that could cause a recession, so balancing all of that with the appropriate level of conservatism so that we can hit what we said we feel good about, the forecast at this stage based on what we know is a little bit trickier.  We\u2019re certainly at the high end of that range and we\u2019ll update next quarter. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, just one last quick one, just picking up on that theme of potential conservatism. Just looking at management solutions, obviously you\u2019re sticking with 5% to 7% for the year, you started at 12. You had some of the ERTC benefit, but it just seems like a lot of decel kind of baked in, so maybe you want to talk through that a little bit. I know you\u2019re talking about higher end, but still. Efrain Rivera : Yes, I\u2019d say this - you know, we\u2019ll talk more as we get kind of midyear, I think one of the things that ends up happening with ERTC in the back half of the year, it becomes a headwind to growth because it doesn\u2019t recur in the same way that the revenues do, so we bake that in. That\u2019s one. We\u2019re against tough comps in the back half of the year, so that\u2019s another issue, and then employment is really the other part that we\u2019re wondering about. Right now, we\u2019re not assuming that there\u2019s a lot of employee adds in the back half of the year. Could we see something that\u2019s different than that? I don\u2019t know, both ways. At this point, I can\u2019t call it close enough, so I\u2019m sticking with where we thought we were going to be at the beginning of the year and then we\u2019ll update as we go through the year. Jason Kupferberg : Fair enough, thank you Efrain. Efrain Rivera : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.  Wanted to start on the PEO and insurance services segment - obviously growth came in on the bottom end of the full-year range, you\u2019re now guiding to the lower end of the range to full year. I know you mentioned some weakness in the insurance business this quarter. Is there anything else to call out within that business that surprised you, whether it was to the upside or the downside? It sounds like existing clients\u2019 hiring activities are still quite strong, sales are good, so just want to make sure I understand all the dynamics there as well. Efrain Rivera : Let me frame it, and then I\u2019ll let John talk to it. He\u2019s obviously well versed in what\u2019s going on in terms of the dynamics of the business. In terms of the plan and forecast and our guidance, we started out the year a little bit lower on the insurance side than we had anticipated, that\u2019s primarily an issue around, and we called it out, on enrollments. We think that trend will persist into the second quarter and then it will start to improve as we get into the back half of the year, so we\u2019re going to have a little bit lower first half than originally anticipated and then the back half as we expected. That\u2019s what\u2019s really kind of moving the PEO numbers down in terms of our outlook. Look - you know, Andrew, better than most, differences in attachment can change revenues really, really quickly, and so we\u2019ll see where we end up on that front as we go through the year. It\u2019s driving our results, largely doesn\u2019t have a significant impact on margin, again as you know because those are relatively low margin revenues, but out of a sense of--I\u2019d say out of a sense of where we ended up in the first quarter and where we\u2019re anticipating second quarter to be. Now I\u2019ll let John talk about the fundamentals of the business, because I think they actually are pretty strong. John Gibson : Yes, look - I feel particularly on the PEO side, I\u2019ll talk about that first, we\u2019re well positioned coming out of first quarter. Remember we\u2019re just now really entering the key selling season, we\u2019re also in open enrollment season within our PEO, so those are two critical periods of time when I look at where we are going into this.  Our client retention is extremely strong. Really, we had set some pretty aggressive targets and we\u2019re actually beating those targets in the PEO in the first quarter, so the value proposition is resonating, so retention was very strong. Sales were strong for the first quarter. I look at where we are from a sales headcount - we actually accelerated. If you remember in the fourth quarter, we said we made some investments in the first quarter. Some of that was actually adding because we saw the demand there. Our tenure is great, we have the best sales retention of any of our divisions in the PEO, so our tenure of our team going into the selling season is really strong.  We just completed our renewals with our health insurance carriers. I feel good about where we are on those, I think we\u2019ve got a good part of that. To Efrain\u2019s point, kind of the attachment of insurance and then once we attach insurance to a client, how many employees are signing up for that, and particularly this may be an affordability issue that we\u2019re maybe seeing, some of the things we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve actually expanded low cost plans in this next enrollment. We\u2019ve expanded our enrollment consultants who will go out and engage clients, so we\u2019re working against what we\u2019ve kind of seen, some trends in the first quarter, but obviously some of the drag in revenue, as Efrain said, is we had a little lower than we historically have seen relative to attachment of insurance in the PEO and a little lower participation than we\u2019ve typically seen as well, and again we\u2019ve taken steps in terms of both plan design and in our sales execution to be able to move forward. The insurance agency, some of the things we saw relative to attachment and participation in our HMP area, similar to PEO, common theme there that we saw there in the first quarter, and then as we\u2019ve talked about, I think repeatedly, the market is continually soft in P&C and continues to be a headwind. Andrew Nicholas : Great, thanks John, thanks Efrain. Those comments were super helpful. For my follow-up, I just wanted to ask a bigger picture question. You mentioned the HR tech conference in your press release and I think again in the prepared remarks. Personally, I was impressed by the number of vendors at the conference and the level of innovation really across the sector. With that in mind, given the number of new products, the amount of money that\u2019s come into the space over the past several years, just wondering if it\u2019s changed how you think about the build versus buy equation. Does M&A make more sense today given the rate of change in the market and how rapidly new products are being built and gaining adoption? Essentially, just want to get your thoughts on build versus buy, appetite for M&A given all that\u2019s going on right now. Thank you. Martin Mucci : Yes, this is Marty. I\u2019ll start it out. It\u2019s an interesting question. I think the appetite is still there. I think valuations are still high, but we\u2019ll see if they catch up and come down some and get more realistic. You know, we\u2019ve always been able to use M&A not only for growth from a product perspective, but I mean actually adding to the technology, so time and attendance started with M&A back many years ago now, 10 or 11 years ago, and probably 12 for the first time and attendance product which then we built into our product and now is one of the fastest growing products we have from that perspective. But I don\u2019t--you know, I don\u2019t think so. I think we really look at that very closely whether we can build. We have a very successful development team here, product management and development that kind of decide what do we have to do from a tech standpoint. We like it being bundled into the Flex product suite, and so we\u2019re careful to do an M&A from a product add-on standpoint, and we don\u2019t really see--I don\u2019t really see, and John can comment on this too, a product that we\u2019re missing right now in the suite that I would have go out and--that we would go out and look at from an M&A perspective. It\u2019s more adding to what we have. The technology, we feel everything, as John mentioned earlier, the HR--the HCM technology that we have, the combination with being able to do so much on the mobile, we have such a large use now of the mobile app. We\u2019re also tying much more to the employees and self service, and so if you didn\u2019t pick up on some of that at HR Tech, self-service has become a big part of our model. That gets the employees of our clients more involved, and right from just making their own changes, self on-boarding, many aspects of when they sign up to Paychex pre-check, which allows them to view--as you know, view their payroll before it\u2019s processed, has really been important to bring the client employees into the picture, which builds better retention and better level of the Paychex mobile app, which still has a 4.8 out of 5 stars. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of M&A from a product need that we have to add to, but there\u2019s still a good appetite for M&A and we\u2019re constantly evaluating opportunities. John Gibson : Yes, I\u2019d probably give you a good example that I actually talked about here on the call, one that we have previously announced and is in the works to go live. I think we\u2019re constantly looking for the right combination of partnerships, technology we can build, and acquisitions that we can bolt on to kind of put a unified experience together that resonates with our customers and addresses problems.  We talked about the recruiting and applicant tracking and on-boarding experience that we launched, reintegrated. That\u2019s a combination of build, we got a partnership with Indeed which we\u2019ve talked about numerous times to help get candidates faster, and then it was also an acquisition that we made some time ago of a company on the on-boarding and applicant tracking side and the unification of that into Flex and using the talent that we had bought, and that\u2019s taken off tremendously, so it\u2019s a better experience. As Marty mentioned, already 1.7 million new hires have went through that process, so that\u2019s an example.  Another example that we\u2019re currently in the process of, and this goes back probably to your question on the insurance agency and about us working to really get more employees participating in all of our insurance products, and that was an acquisition that we made just a little bit ago with the benefits administration and enrollment technology, found a great, small little company could add both talent and how to design that from a user experience perspective. We\u2019re in the final states of deploying that, and actually that will be deployed in our agency and our PEO as an electronic mobile enabled, a way for employees to enrol in benefits, and it\u2019s also going to really highlight the ancillary benefits. Again, this is showing them the right plan, getting them to participate and getting them to really see the full suite of insurance we\u2019ve got electronically and a unified experience. That\u2019s in early stages of being launched as we speak right now, so. There\u2019s a couple examples of where I think we\u2019re going to continue to look for experiences we\u2019re trying to build for our clients and their employees, what capabilities do we have to build into Flex today, and where can we either find partners or find tech bolt-ons that will help us improve that experience. Andrew Nicholas : Great, thanks again. Operator : Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, thank you for taking my question this morning. I wanted to ask about the pricing environment and the degree to which you\u2019ve been able to kind of pass through potentially larger price increases given the inflationary backdrop. Should we expect a bigger contribution from pricing in this environment this year than we normally would? Efrain Rivera : Yes, in terms of pricing, Ramsey, I think that--I think Marty mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call that we were towards the higher end of the range of what we typically price, and I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now and that\u2019s what\u2019s holding. Look, I think we are constantly trying to strive for getting the balance between price and value correct, and I think that we\u2019re striking at this point the right balance on that issue. Martin Mucci : Yes, the price realization feels very good right now, and as John mentioned, I think it was a combination of a lot of things John is saying. When you have a big need for recruiting, hiring and on-boarding employees, and we\u2019re able to solve that particularly with technology, you\u2019re saving--we\u2019re hearing more and more from the clients that they\u2019re saving operationally, they\u2019re being more effective, therefore a little big higher on the price range is working and it\u2019s sticking, so discounting has really been not an issue at all. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay, quite helpful. A follow-up from me, I wanted to ask a question on the relative resiliency of the two parts of your business. I\u2019m just curious if there are drivers or factors that make management solutions and/or PEO more cyclically sensitive relative to each other. I kind of feel like investors have a better handle on management solutions as it\u2019s sort of the longer dated segment, but I\u2019m just curious if you feel that PEO also has the resiliency that you\u2019d expect from the overall business. Martin Mucci : I can start and John can jump in. I think, Ramsey, definitely PEO does right now all the things that John just talked about and I just mentioned - you know, recruiting, hiring, having insurance plans that as a small or midsized business, you might not be able to have on your own. The PEO has continued to be pretty strong. You do see fluctuations - like we mentioned, in this first question we didn\u2019t have quite as much enrollment, but we\u2019re also heading into the real selling season and the enrollment portion of the PEO, so PEO has continued to be very popular and I think it is very resilient in a time when I\u2019m competing for employees, I\u2019m a business competing for employees, and I need better insurance plans, I need better help in signing people up for those insurance plans, so yes, I think it has very strong resiliency just like the management solutions offerings. Anything you want to add to that? John Gibson : No. Look, when I look at the clients that are attracted to the PEO value proposition, these are clients that are having to navigate very complex HR or complex employment situations - multi-state, they\u2019re in difficult states where there\u2019s a lot of regulatory compliance, and other risks facing their business, and they view our HR support, our compliance support, the way that we assist them in EOC-type of complaints and issues as a critical part of their business. I just had a comment on this from a client - we have a small client that said they couldn\u2019t live without their HR person helping them out.  I would step again just again and maybe reiterate macro, because maybe we\u2019re not explaining it well. You look at our employment--you look at the HR Pulse survey, and I look at what issues our nearly 700 HR consultants are facing for our clients, our clients are still trying to fill open positions, so not only did we see checks and worksite employees increase, but we continue to see them ask us for technology solutions, support, and how can they continue to fill open positions. Certainly what we see in the underlying macro side in both the managed solutions and the PEO is that they\u2019re really needing our HR support, it\u2019s a complex environment, and I think there\u2019s good resiliency going forward. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay, so similar performance profile through the cycle for both segments, is what I got from that, so I appreciate your answer. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni from MoffettNathanson. Eugene Simuni : Thank you, hi guys. Martin Mucci : Hey Eugene. I know that wasn\u2019t your name. Eugene Simuni : That\u2019s okay, no problem at all. I wanted to come back for a second to macro. I\u2019m hearing loud and clear what you guys are saying, that you\u2019re not seeing any signs of recession, slowdown in the employment numbers, and still very tight labor market - that\u2019s clear. I wanted to ask about a slightly different metric, which is, let\u2019s say, businesses\u2019 willingness to invest in new technology, so situations where you would get real upgrades, feature additions, or maybe switching from a legacy provider to you guys - things like that. Curious if you\u2019re seeing any incremental caution across your small business customers on that even as performance remains strong, as people just get more cautious looking ahead, and if not, then in your experience running this company for a long time, when times get a little bit more volatile, can we expect that caution to increase, and why or why not? Martin Mucci : I would say at this point, we\u2019re not seeing that yet because, in fact, in a time like this, they\u2019re trying to--the biggest things John talked about, some of the surveys we\u2019ve been doing lately, it\u2019s about operating efficiency, it\u2019s about how do I fill these positions, so the demand is still there for their products at this stage of the macro, and so they\u2019re needing people and they\u2019re needing technology to save them money in other ways because wages are up, they have to give more benefits, so there are actually--I think in this kind of environment, and it\u2019s been this way as the market\u2019s been tight, small and midsized businesses need to offer better benefits, they need to offer more technology, they need to have a mobile app like ours that you can deal with remote workforces, so actually I don\u2019t think that has--you know, they haven\u2019t gotten any more skittish, I guess I\u2019d say, about investing. They\u2019re actually really needed at this stage of the game. Typically, depending on what kind of macro environment you\u2019re in, but in this one where it\u2019s about hiring and it\u2019s about retaining employees, they\u2019re very much looking for technology, benefits, all the things we offer, and even if you\u2019re a midsize and might have to go through some re-shuffling of people, you\u2019re looking to one of those 700 HR specialists that John mentioned that we have, that would say okay, how do I do this, how do I attract people, how do I retail them, how do I maybe lay some off while I hire others in the little bit larger companies, so we\u2019re actually seeing a great demand for technology in the HCM world as well as being able to handle remote workforces which really are here to stay. Eugene Simuni : Got it, okay. Thank you. Then for my follow-up, probably a question for Efrain, actually switching gears a bit. We talked about the margin dynamics over the short term already a bit, so understand there are kinds of ups and downs through the quarters, but I wanted to touch on the longer term margin dynamics for a second. As we are now moving away from the COVID pandemic and settling more in maybe the steady state, where digital channels have become a bigger part, digital buying has become a bigger part post-pandemic of your model, how are you seeing that really impacting structural margins of the business as we\u2019re getting more experience with that more digitally focused model? I\u2019m curious. Efrain Rivera : Well you know, Eugene, I think we\u2019ve talked about it, certainly talked to many of you on the call, we have a relentless drive for efficiency in the business, and so as more of the business goes into either digitally-enabled solutions or fully automated solutions, we expect over time that\u2019s going to be a driver of improved productivity and improved operating margins.  I always caveat with you also have to balance investment in the business for sustainable growth, so if we get 50 basis points or 75 or 100 of improvement in operating margins, we may decide that in order to create more operating efficiency--I\u2019m sorry, more sustainable margins over the long haul, we have to invest a part of it, but certainly there are very few weeks that don\u2019t pass where we\u2019re not having that conversation. I think that John\u2019s been a big driver in the last decade around making that model work, and I expect that to continue over the cycle. John Gibson : Yes, I\u2019ll jump on that, because I think our business model and our DNA as a company is around being the best operators in the business. I think we\u2019ve proven that over decades, and that\u2019s certainly not going to change with me in this position.  I think what you\u2019re seeing is it goes back to the question you asked earlier, is look - clients are demanding technology because their employees are demanding technology. I mean, what we\u2019re seeing relative to the digitalization is really not just us trying to push that on clients. There is a big pull from clients and their employees to expect that they\u2019re going to have a technology experience, whether that\u2019s when they\u2019re recruiting, if they want to recruit people, you\u2019re not putting an ad in the paper. If you\u2019re doing that, you\u2019re probably not going to find many people, particularly the people that are out looking for employment. So whether it\u2019s benefits, whether it\u2019s their finances, they\u2019re looking for that to drive that, and not only is that a benefit for the customer but that\u2019s also a benefit for Paychex.  Digitization continues with our mobile usage, it continues to accelerate with our clients and our employees. It\u2019s up 67% year-over-year, and we had a pretty big year the year prior to that, so I continue to see this as kind of being something--it\u2019s not a nice to have anymore, it\u2019s really a must have if you want to go out and compete in the talent market today. You\u2019ve got to have an HR technology solution that is easy to use and really meets the full needs of what employees are looking for. Eugene Simuni : Got it, okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Good morning. Wanted to ask about the different market segments. I know you guys called out strength in the mid market, so just thinking about the health in the lower end of the market, could you just talk a little bit about new business starts, retention in that market, any kind of softness in spend you\u2019re seeing there? Martin Mucci : Well, I think as we mentioned in the beginning, Bryan, small business--you know, new business starts are not as strong as they were last year. The last couple years during COVID and the pandemic, of course, we had a lot of people leave big business and start businesses, and so small business retention from a client perspective, we said was starting to normalize a bit because some small businesses that started during that period have gone out of business. But the demand for employees from small businesses is still needed and we\u2019re still--they\u2019re still adding employees, so I guess the bad news is some are a little bit more out of business but the good news is that most of our clients, even at the small end, are adding employees and still have a lot of postings and openings to fill. I think that mid market, what we\u2019ve said about mid market being stronger is I think we\u2019ve executed much, much better in the mid market not only from a product suite and a technology suite of what we\u2019re offering to the client, but the sales team has done really well. We hit our stride last year, and that has continued right through the first quarter with very good double-digit growth there. John Gibson : Yes, and I would add that not only is the demand still strong in the mid market - you know, double digit first quarter, I think well positioned going forward, retention--when you really look at that mid market, which you get into our HR services, you get into the PEO, you get into the mid market HCM, where our clients are getting the full value utilizing a technology, we\u2019re seeing very good retention levels. As we said, our revenue retention is at record levels. I mentioned and called our PEO particularly, has just had stellar performance in the quarter relative to client retention, and we\u2019ve seen strong retention in our HR businesses holistically and the mid market is solid as well. I also think that our price-value equation in that market has held up very, very well as well, with our average sell-in revenue in the first quarter really strong, really strong. Bryan Keane : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Just one clarification for Efrain on the second quarter margin, I heard about the second quarter revenue being lower, and you called out some call-outs there. But on the margin in particular, is it just a revenue issue plus additional investments that just flow in, that cause the drop in the margin? I just want to make sure I have all the pieces there for the 38% margin. Efrain Rivera : Bryan, you heard exactly what I said. I must have been partially clear on that, so--no, that\u2019s exactly it, a little lower revenue, a little higher expenses. It\u2019s typically the lowest revenue quarter of the year, so you get a little bit of that impact, and it\u2019s in line with what we anticipated it to be. Bryan Keane : Okay, super. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thanks so much. Let me add my congratulations, and we share your view on Efrain too, Marty, so. Martin Mucci : Try that music trivia sometime. It\u2019s astounding. Kevin McVeigh : Exactly. Hey, maybe just one, I guess higher level - I mean, John, you\u2019re taking the baton, the organization is super-super strong, but no two CEOs are the same, so any initial thoughts as to areas of focus, maybe, where you might dial in a little bit more? I mean, obviously you\u2019re building on a great legacy, but just any thoughts as to where your initial areas of focus are, whether it\u2019s capital allocation or just technology? Any initial thoughts? John Gibson : Well Kevin, thanks for that, and as you know, I\u2019ve been a part of the leadership team for nearly a decade now, so a lot of the things we\u2019ve been working on, I\u2019ve been involved in and highly supportive of. Look, I think you can expect we\u2019re going to continue to really focus on expanding our leadership in technology and HR. I mentioned it earlier, going to continue to be the best operators on the business and we\u2019re going to consistently be a top performer in terms of total shareholder return. I think these are three traditions I don\u2019t plan to mess with, quite frankly, because they\u2019re working and they\u2019re what I believe. Look, we\u2019ve got opportunities to expand our offerings and continue to innovate and change. I would tell you that I think Paychex has always done that. There\u2019s no question, under Marty\u2019s leadership that has accelerated, and I think you should expect us to continue to accelerate that. We\u2019re going to continue to look for new ways and growth platforms that we can apply to help our clients grow. We\u2019re going to continue to invest in improving the experiences - I\u2019ve mentioned that, I keep using this word experiences. We have a lot of great products, we\u2019ve got a lot of great service offerings. How we package those things together to address business problems is critical. I think the other thing that we\u2019ve begun to do more of and I think you\u2019ll see more of is, look, we\u2019re really beginning to use a large amount of internal data we have to really apply that to retention, insights, product that we\u2019ve launched for our customers, and being used with our HR professionals with customers to identify how they can retain clients. We\u2019re also using--ERTC is a good example where we\u2019re using our internal data sets to really identify customers that have specific needs and then able to get our sales force into a situation where they can talk to a client who has that need at that moment and that drives productivity, and I think you\u2019re going to continue to see us do that. I think you\u2019re going to continue to see what I said before - we\u2019re a tech company and we\u2019re going to continue to invest like a tech company, so I think relative to capital utilization, you\u2019re going to continue to see us look at applying capital in areas where we can improve our technology footprint and help our clients. Kevin McVeigh : That\u2019s super helpful. Then just one quick follow-up, I think for you, Efrain - appreciate what you\u2019re saying in terms of the outlook on the Fed funds, things like that. But can you tell us what Fed fund rate is in the implied guidance right now, and then just remind us if you can what 25 basis points--like, what the sensitivity is to the revenue for every incremental 25 BPs? Efrain Rivera : Yes, so in the first quarter, we called it out, it was between 3 and 4, kind of around the midpoint there where we expected, I think I may have called specifically 3.75, so right now we\u2019re working with something in that range. Obviously everyone\u2019s chief economist has a different number that ranges probably with a 4 and some probably 5 and above, but I want to call out--and by the way, a quarter basis point is somewhere in the $4 million to $5 million range in terms of net income, so it\u2019s potentially important. It could be important. But Kevin, the one thing I think that Jason pointed out that\u2019s really important, I think what makes it a little bit trickier is you don\u2019t want to push your chips to the middle of the table and go all-in short term and have a great year in terms of year-over-year interest income, only to give it back in the next year, so what we\u2019re really looking at is what\u2019s the right duration for the portfolio in this environment, and so that\u2019s why I can\u2019t--I wouldn\u2019t necessarily, and I\u2019m cautious about saying, hey, I\u2019ve got 100 basis points up versus my forecast, and that relates to X. I am a little bit cautious about that because I think we\u2019ve got to manage a somewhat volatile interest rate environment here with the Fed and figure out what the implications for \u201924 are. I\u2019d just leave it at that. So we\u2019re looking at it, and by the way, it\u2019s not like somehow we\u2019re geniuses here. We\u2019ve got some of the best minds in the business on the fixed income side working for us, so we\u2019ll take counsel and have a lot of discussion on that. Kevin McVeigh : Helpful, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Samad Samana from Jefferies. Jordan Bret : Hey, this is Jordan Bret on for Samad. Marty, Efrain, congrats on the strong results. John, also congrats on the new role. John Gibson : Thank you. Jordan Bret : I think we\u2019ve touched on a lot already, but I wanted to double-click on the employee growth that you\u2019re spoken about in both management solutions and PEO. Obviously with COVID, the recovery was not completely even by vertical or geographic area. I think in the past, we\u2019ve called out Florida was \u2013 saw some strength first. I\u2019m curious, the growth that you saw this past quarter, is that broad based or is it coming from a specific vertical or geographic area, maybe lapping what we saw at the start of the recovery from the pandemic? Efrain Rivera : Yes, so let me disaggregate. I\u2019ll get started and then let John add some color commentary. The PEO is a little bit different than management solutions per se, so what we saw was strength in ads in larger clients, and that\u2019s partly a result of really good work that we have done over the last four to six quarters in mid market. We\u2019d done good work before that, but I think you\u2019ve seen the benefits of that coupled with, and that\u2019s always important, coupled with the improvement from last quarter in terms of the overall hiring environment in the first quarter. We expect that that starts to slow a bit. With respect to PEO, when we look at worksite employees, that was pretty widespread, so obviously because our business is over-indexed in the State of Florida and in certain verticals relative to management solutions, we saw strength there, but PEO was pretty widespread. Now, PEO is a little bit different in the sense that our average client has roughly about 30 or so employees, so you\u2019re also getting a little bit of a larger, let\u2019s call it client effect in terms of the adds.  That\u2019s a little bit more color. I don\u2019t know if Marty or John want to comment. Martin Mucci : Well, I think we\u2019ve seen it kind of across the board. Most of the client base has seen an increase in employees, so we\u2019ve seen them adding employees, and of course that\u2019s going to be in that 1 to 20 range in particular, but 1 to 50 probably we\u2019re seeing that. I think that Florida and the south, we\u2019ve seen that in the small business index and that those have been the strongest job growth states for small business because that\u2019s where the people are. And so there\u2019s still a lot of job openings, particularly in leisure and hospitality, and they\u2019re able to fill them in the Texas, Florida, Georgia, even North Carolina kind of areas - they\u2019re the best job growth kind of areas, so that\u2019s where small businesses are doing the best.  But overall, we\u2019ve seen our businesses able to add people, and obviously that\u2019s adding checks, as John mentioned. John Gibson : Yes, just to reiterate, I think we\u2019ve seen across the board in pretty much all segments improvement in the employment levels and still, in all the surveys we\u2019re seeing, again both the survey we did, I know there was one I think that was just in the paper recently a couple days ago that I read that reinforced it, small business owners are struggling more than midsized companies, and we\u2019ve seen that in our data. When we look at where the number of checks and where are worksite employees have accelerated more, a mid market company that offers more benefits is outcompeting for the talent, and so that\u2019s why we\u2019ve really been focused on this recruiting and the partnerships that we\u2019ve built and the technology we\u2019ve built to help small business owners have a fair advantage. I would also say, to Efrain\u2019s point, another interesting and again a little data, but we certainly looked at this a lot when we were doing the down trim, what we know is customers who were in our HR products, whether that\u2019s our ASO product or our PEO product, they decelerated less than the general market, and when it came time for a recovery, they were able to staff up faster. I do think that\u2019s because of our HR support. We certainly in those areas have seen better recovery, faster recovery, more full employment, and I think that has to do with both our technology and our advisory service and helping them [indiscernible] advantage there. Jordan Bret : Awesome, that\u2019s all very helpful color. I think along the same lines, I wanted to follow up with--you know, we talked about difficult hiring is at this time, and your own business, you\u2019ve seen this hiring pull forward and that\u2019s obviously impacting the cadence of margins throughout the year. This past quarter, were you hiring plans on track, ahead of or lagging your initial expectations, and was there any change in your ability to hire incremental sales or support staff throughout the quarter? Just curious if there were any changes on that end. Martin Mucci : No, actually we did very well. The hiring machine really took off here from a recruiting and a hiring perspective, and the retention is better. I think you\u2019re hearing that in the overall market, particularly for larger businesses. Now, we\u2019ve made some changes to that. We\u2019ve improved some of our starting wage rates, just like a lot of companies, and did some other things as well for some of the existing employees, and I think that\u2019s paid off. Yes, we\u2019re fully staffed, and we\u2019re ready to go--actually, we\u2019re ready at the start of the quarter for sales and everything else, so we\u2019ve done very well on the hiring front and are ready for the rest of the year. Jordan Bret : Great, well thanks for taking my questions. Again John, congrats on the new role. John Gibson : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Thank you very much, and my congratulations to both Marty and John as well.  I wanted to--you\u2019ve addressed a lot of our key questions, but I wanted to quickly follow up. Marty, can you just talk to really quickly again the expected cadence for PEO during the course of the year, and just so I understand the expected improvement later, is that because of the things John mentioned of adjustments to the PEO plan, some changes in sales, etc., or is there something else that you expect to have an impact there? Efrain Rivera : Hey James, let me talk to that. I think as I said at the beginning of the call, we started the year in the first half a little bit under what we expected from an attachment perspective and insurances were a little softer than we anticipated. The impact on margin is pretty insignificant. As we get through the year, our expectations are that PEO growth accelerates in the back half of the year, and part of it is that we had pretty strong worksite employee growth coming out of first quarter, so if you get that coupled with better healthcare attachment in the back half of the year--look, if people make decisions, are making decisions in this quarter, you don\u2019t see the revenue this quarter, you see it in future quarters. They\u2019re making those decisions on the assumption that those things materialize as they should, then growth accelerates in the back half of the year. That\u2019s basically the explanation for what\u2019s going on. James Faucette : Go t it, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the clarification there.  Then I guess more from a landscape perspective, you\u2019ve touched on and obviously highlighted over time but also on this call everything that you\u2019ve done from a technology perspective in terms of Paychex\u2019s ability to help its customers and continue to improve, but what are you seeing happening in the regional provider space? How are they being able to keep up with you, the incumbents, on tech, and do you expect further consolidation? I guess the real question is where you\u2019re not winning from regionals, what\u2019s the primary reason and how can you address that? Thanks. Martin Mucci : Yes, sure. Actually, we\u2019re doing very well against the regionals. I think it is hard to keep up. They certainly have been viable competitors, but I think that it\u2019s--we haven\u2019t seen a big change in the competitive environment. I think if anything, we feel like we\u2019ve really continued to jumpstart - you know, John mentioned the Voice Assist that we just offered, no one else has offered that with Google, the work we\u2019ve done to combine for recruiting and on-boarding our clients. You know, I think the regionals, there may be some consolidation. I think they\u2019re looking for probably some more support from a tech standpoint because there continues to be a lot of investment going forward that we obviously have a great track record of doing, but I think there\u2019s been a lot of demand, so that\u2019s kind of kept everybody happy. The pie is--the overall pie has continued to grow, particularly in the mid market, so I think they\u2019ve all done--you know, everybody\u2019s done pretty well. We\u2019ll have to see how that goes forward as we get into the back half of this year, but we feel very confident, not any big changes in the competitive environment, and we\u2019ve performed very well. James Faucette : Great, thanks a lot. Martin Mucci : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JP Morgan. Martin Mucci : Tien-Tsin? He might be on mute, or he might have been dropped. John Gibson : Gretchen, are you there? Operator : Yes-- Tien- Tsin Huang : Can you guys hear me? I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m here. Martin Mucci : Yes, we can hear you now. Tien- Tsin Huang : I apologize, I had some trouble with my headphones. Sorry to keep you guys waiting.  Quick thanks to Marty, of course - always appreciated our conversations through the years, so. Not sure if you\u2019ll miss these calls, but definitely we\u2019ll miss chatting with you. Martin Mucci : Oh, definitely! Tien- Tsin Huang : Yes, there you go; and John, look forward to working with you more. You did, in your remarks, credit Marty\u2019s vision for embracing technology, and I think someone asked you about what your focus or legacy might be - I caught that, but I\u2019m just curious, John, given your background on services and where you were before Paychex, I\u2019m curious if you see more opportunity to improve services here further for Paychex to complement tech, or is it one and the same in terms of tech and services starting to blend a little bit further? I\u2019m just curious how you think about balancing those two things, right, between the services and the tech of the company. John Gibson : Yes, look Tien-Tsin, I think you\u2019re right, I see it as one and the same, and that\u2019s probably the reason why Marty and I were reminiscing about my interview here and what really attracted me, was Marty\u2019s vision was very consistent with mine and my experience about where I saw our industry going from my prior experience. My view is I think having the best technology and having a unified user experience is going to be critical not only for the demand and what customers and employees want, but also to drive the operational efficiency that I think customers are going to want. That being said, customers need to know how to use that tool, and they are facing complex issues outside of items that technology can solve, particularly in the HR area. I think we have a unique position to be able to reposition our traditional services, kind of hey, I put something in a system for you, and really position that more as an advisory opportunity. I think about the things we\u2019re doing with the mass sets of data that we have, the benchmarking the data, the way we can do analytics, the fact that we can call a client up and say, we think you\u2019re going to have a retention problem, let us walk you through your insights. That\u2019s what service is going to be. It\u2019s really not even service in the historical sense that you would see a service company talk about. I do believe that that\u2019s going to resonate, and we see it resonating in this complex environment. More and more companies are going to end up having employees in multiple states than ever before to compete for talent and the remote workforce, that brings regulatory complexities that just technology can\u2019t solve for you. You\u2019ve got to think about how you\u2019re going to do this, and so I do think that we\u2019re uniquely positioned and I think you\u2019ll continue to see us invest in technology and invest in HR, and really position ourselves as the digital HR leader in the marketplace. Tien- Tsin Huang : Got it. Appreciate you going through that, because I still think about it--you know, when I started covering Paychex, I always thought of it as a services company, and of course tech and digital has taken over everything, so just wanted to get back to basics there, so thanks for that. If you don\u2019t mind, my quick follow-up - I know the call\u2019s getting long here, just thinking about the modules and the breadth of services, you mentioned Paychex being the largest 401K record keeper. I know the equity markets have come down a little bit. Is that having any influence on your outlook in general, and also just clarifying, if you don\u2019t mind, two questions in one, just the healthcare enrollment piece, is the lower attach or enrollment a function of mix of clients or is it a competitiveness of the plans issue? I just want to make sure I understand that, if you don\u2019t mind those two questions. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Well, you got two disparate ones in there. Tien- Tsin Huang : Sorry, yes. I\u2019m trying to not take up too much time. Efrain Rivera : No, I\u2019ll talk to it first and I\u2019ll let John talk a little bit, and Marty if you want, on the second. In our retirement services business, as many of you know, we do have about a third of the revenue there is derived from a basis point, so it has a modest drag in terms of revenue. It\u2019s not really significant - I mean, I\u2019d just put it as de minimis in terms of the balance of the year.  Then on healthcare enrollment, you\u2019re asking for more color on that, I\u2019ll let John touch on what\u2019s driving a little bit lower healthcare enrollment. John Gibson : Yes, look, I think--I wish I had the perfect answer to that. Looking at all the data, my experience tells me a lot of that can be mix of clients. Again, a lot of it has to do with what\u2019s the average wage of a client, what\u2019s the industry they\u2019re in, but you also have, as I said, economic situations where a person may be having benefits and deciding I can\u2019t afford benefits right now given my economic situation, and they drop the benefits. We recognize that, that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing a lot in really looking at our plan designs in the PEO in particular, rolling out lower cost plans, also rolling out non-traditional plans. We\u2019ve actually created an entire wellness kind of spectrum of products and services to really meet the needs, the economic needs of every type of worksite employee that we would have there, and we\u2019re also driving digitalization into our H&B business - I mentioned that earlier, that\u2019s rolling out in the second quarter, so that we can offer a more full suite of benefit options that can match the price point of both the clients and their employees, regardless of what their economic situation is. We certainly are trying to expand what we\u2019re doing. We recognize that for some employees and some customers, the cost of getting some of these benefits is outside of their capabilities right now, and so we\u2019re really focused from a product development perspective to make sure we have the broadest suite of offerings in the marketplace. Tien- Tsin Huang : Got it. That\u2019s helpful, thanks, and sorry for extending the call. Martin Mucci : No, no worries, Tien-Tsin. Your questions are always appreciated. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thanks for the time, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from Baird. Mark Marcon : Good morning. Marty, congratulations on just tremendous accomplishments over the tenure that you\u2019ve been CEO; and John, look forward to working with you. Martin Mucci : Thanks Mark. Mark Marcon : With regards to the macro environment, you did mention small business formations are a little bit lower. How are you thinking about the sales pipeline for HR management solutions, and to what extent can you dial the marketing strategy to highlight some of the tech improvements? I was at HR Tech, I was really impressed by the voice recognition program with Google, and are you charging more for those types of solutions? Martin Mucci : Yes, we\u2019re really--I mean, let\u2019s take the marketing side of it. It\u2019s doing exactly that, Mark - it\u2019s being at HR Tech, it\u2019s getting the word out there. We\u2019re doing a lot with and trying to partner with folks like Google to be sure that it\u2019s known that we have the only--we\u2019re the only one that can do that with their Google Assistant and have you be able to do it totally hands free. We\u2019re pushing--you know, the marketing has been pretty aggressive for years through webinars, through the tech conferences, and of course through all the podcasts and then just all of the online work that we\u2019ve done, and that\u2019s been very important to us to get the message out, and we think that that\u2019s worked well, so I think that\u2019s been good. I think on the--so we think there\u2019s still a huge demand, and John mentioned, I think earlier, the product penetration rates continue to go up. I think that s the tech word has gotten out there and the need, of course, as we\u2019ve talked about a lot on the call, we\u2019ve really seen this additional product penetration, and even if new business starts are less than what they were, they\u2019re still up, they\u2019re just not up the big numbers that they were d during COVID, when everybody--or many people ran from large businesses and started small businesses. So they\u2019re still up, we\u2019re still obviously doing very well on the start-ups, but I think we\u2019re doing even better with the product suite to make the additional penetration of the existing client base. Mark Marcon : Right, so the way I\u2019m taking it, it sounds like the pipeline in terms of the key selling season for management solutions, as well as PEO continues to be robust, and you\u2019re not really seeing much of a change in terms of what we\u2019re reading about from a macro headline perspective as it relates to that? Martin Mucci : Correct. We still feel it should be a good selling season. It\u2019s early, but we feel good about it. Mark Marcon : Great, and then can you talk a little bit about retention? How do you think that ends up being impacted as ERTC kind of winds down? Does that have any sort of impact? Efrain Rivera : Hey Mark. So you know, we gave a little bit of color in Marty\u2019s call. I think what I\u2019d call out is two things. One is, and it\u2019s one thing that John mentioned, but from a revenue retention standpoint, we\u2019re at near record highs, so that makes sense. Marty called out on the very lower end, we\u2019ve seen a little bit more churn - that is to be expected given where the market is right now, so on those two, I think we feel we\u2019re pretty well positioned going into the balance of the year. ERTC really should not have a significant impact on client retention. I think that it is a--if anything, it\u2019s positive in the sense that it just demonstrates the value add of Paychex. A lot of our competitors are not talking about it because, candidly, their model doesn\u2019t allow them to get there. Some are doing it, but I think that we think about giving our clients that level of consulting and expertise that John was mentioning earlier, so from a retention standpoint, it really should not have a significant impact. Mark Marcon : Terrific, thank you. Martin Mucci : Okay, thanks Mark. Operator : Your next question comes from [indiscernible] from Northcoast Research. Unknown Analyst : Good morning gentlemen, and congrats on a great quarter. I just want to get some color around your float portfolio. As the Fed continues to hike rates, do you think there will be any changes, or has there been any changes in the management of your float portfolio? Efrain Rivera : Hey, I think I answered earlier that in the environment, every time the Fed makes another pronouncement about what they expect to do, we huddle and figure out what the implications on the portfolio are, and what we\u2019re trying to do is adjust the duration based on what we believe is going to happen and when we think we\u2019re going to see peak interest rates to position the portfolio, not just for \u201923 but for \u201924. I would say the change is we\u2019ve become a little bit more dynamic in terms of what\u2019s the balance between short and long term is, and as the year progresses, we\u2019ll continue to make adjustments real time to take advantage of what we think are changes in the landscape. Unknown Analyst : All right, thank you for re-answering that question. Do you have any thoughts on change in your return of capital to shareholder strategy? Efrain Rivera : The short answer is no. I think Marty and John talked a little bit about this, which is obviously we\u2019re going to continue to pay a pretty strong dividend, we will buy back shares to offset dilution, and we will look at deployment of capital in terms of M&A if it makes sense, if it builds value in the portfolio, so from that standpoint, no significant changes. Unknown Analyst : Thank you so much. Efrain Rivera : Okay. Operator : Our last question comes from Scott Wurtzel from Wolfe Research. Scott Wurtzel : Hey, good morning guys. Just one question from me, just on the revenue retention side of things. I know you called out it\u2019s still trending above pre-pandemic levels, and I think John had mentioned you\u2019re continuing to see attach rates of high value products, so just wondering if you can just maybe give a little bit more color on what products are exactly resonating most with the client base. John Gibson : Yes, it\u2019s really our HR suite of products. You continue to see our online products, I just mentioned the recruiting and applicant tracking really popular right now, 401K retirement very popular, and then time and attendance is the other. I put that in kind of the online area, anything around the automation of the employee-employer relationship is in very high demand, very high demand right now. People are looking for those operational efficiencies, their workforces are more dispersed than ever before, and they\u2019re leveraging technology to keep track of what\u2019s going on. Scott Wurtzel : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys. Martin Mucci : Okay, thank you. Gretchen, that\u2019s it, right, for calls? Operator : Yes, no further questions. Martin Mucci : All right, well one more thank you to the over 16,000 employees of Paychex who deliver the great results for us all. At this point, we\u2019ll close the call. If you\u2019re interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 90 days.  I would like to thank you all for your support you have given me in my role as CEO over the years, and I know I\u2019m leaving you all in good hands. Have a great day, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.",

Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this call will be recorded, and I will be standing by if you should need any assistance.  It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. John Gibson, President and CEO. Please go ahead, sir. John Gibson : Thanks, Tadd. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex second quarter fiscal year '23 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. We'll start the call with an update on the business for the second quarter and then Efrain will review our financial results and outlook for fiscal year '23. We'll then open it up to your questions. We delivered solid financial results for the second quarter with total revenue of 7% and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 9%. Demand for our comprehensive solution suite remains strong and we are well positioned to help our clients succeed. Our unique combination of leading HR technology, HR expertise and the wide breadth of solutions we have to address the many needs in the marketplace continue to help small and midsized businesses navigate this very dynamic and challenging environment. We continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic environment and our internal leading indicators. The latest findings from our Paychex IHS Small Business Employment Watch revealed moderating growth in jobs and steady growth in wages. Our clients continue to be challenged by the continuing impacts of the pandemic, inflationary pressures and the challenges of this labor market. However, small and midsized businesses continue to show their resilience. Our revenue retention remained solid as we focus on retaining clients and driving increased value and penetration of our HR outsourcing, HCM software and retirement solutions. Our overall HR outsourcing business continues to perform well with strong growth in worksite employees and record revenue retention. We achieved a major milestone this quarter. We now serve over 2 million worksite employees across our ASO and PEO business, clearly establishing us as an HR leader. Our industry-leading HR advisory services sets us apart and our certified HR professionals are truly a unique asset as they are advising our clients on HR issues as well as leveraging our HR technology and the analytics from our vast SMB data set to help our clients achieve greater operational efficiency, increase employee engagement and reduce turnover. While demand for our technology and HR outsourcing solutions remain strong, we continue to see shifts in what offerings clients find are the best fit for their current situation. Both early and during the pandemic, we saw lower demand for adding employer health benefits. We continue to see this trend and also high demand for our ASO solutions, driven by businesses seeking immediate assistance with HR issues and filing for tax credits, but delaying decisions on adding or changing their insurance offering to their employees. In addition, the lower medical plan sales and participant volumes in our health and benefits area of our insurance agency that we discussed last quarter continued in the second quarter, and we saw some similar trends in our Florida at-risk insurance program in the PEO, impacting revenue growth in that area of the business. Awareness and demand of our employee retention tax credit or ERTC service, which helps clients maximize eligible tax credits, continues to grow. To date, we've helped more than 50,000 clients secure billions in ERTC. A recent survey actually showed just 63% of business -- that 63% of business owners didn't even know that they were eligible for these credits. We continue to educate existing clients of the benefits as well as leverage this service to attract new clients. We continue to invest and enhance our product suite and customer experiences. In November, we released our enhancements to Paychex Flex, focused on further streamlining the recruiting, onboarding, time and attendance, and benefits administration experiences. Through our HR technology, three out of four Paychex clients surveyed have shortened the time required from recruiting, screening, tracking and onboarding new employees. Those clients reported an average time savings of 26%, indicating that the typical two-month recruiting cycle has now been reduced to just six. I'm very excited about our Retention Insights offering, which continues to deliver strong results for our clients at a time when businesses remain committed to retaining their existing staff. This feature uses predictive analytics, coupled with our vast data sets, to provide insights on potential employee flight risk. Clients leveraging the Retention Insights offering are showing a 15% reduction in turnover when compared against their industry peers. We're very pleased we received the Bronze Brandon Hall Group Excellence Award for Best Advance in HR Predictive Analytics Technology for this solution. This is the 10th consecutive year they've recognized us. During the quarter, we also were recognized with the IDC 2022 SaaS Customer Service Satisfaction Award for Core HR and we are honored to have received this award as another confirmation of the power of our HR technology and the quality of our advisory services. These awards continue to validate that Paychex is a technology leader and that our focus on HR is delivering real impact for our clients and their employees. At this time, we're heading into our critical year-end season. We are fully staffed in both sales and service, and we have good momentum. I want to thank all the employees in advance for all their hard work and dedication in making this the best year-end ever. Now I'll turn it over to Efrain who will take you through our financial results for the second quarter. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks, John, and good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events. You know the customary comments. Take a look on our press release if you have any questions on that. Let me start by providing some of the key points for the quarter, and then I'll finish with a review of our fiscal 2023 outlook. Both service revenue and total revenue increased 7% to $1.2 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 8% to $895 million driven by higher client employment levels and revenue per client. Revenue per client was positively impacted by additional product penetration. HR ancillary services, largely ERTC and price realization, we continue to see strong attachment of our HR solutions, retirement and time and attendance solutions. I will note that revenue from our ERTC service benefited second quarter revenue growth by approximately 1%. We anticipated ERTC revenue would moderate in fiscal 2023 but strong demand and execution have led to better-than-expected results. While ERTC was a tailwind to Management Solutions growth for the first half, it will become a moderate headwind in the second half. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 4% to $273 million, driven by growth in average worksite employees and revenue per client. The rate of growth was tempered by the impact of factors John previously discussed, including lower medical plan attachment and participant volumes along with the mix shift to ASO. And I would just note on PEO and Insurance Solutions, Insurance Solutions was significantly below the growth rate of PEO. Interest on funds held for clients increased 54% for the quarter to $22 million primarily due to higher average interest rates along with growth in investment balances. Total expenses increased 7% to $718 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher headcount, wage rates and general costs to support the growth of our business. Operating income increased 7% to $472 million with an operating margin of 39.7%, in line with the prior year period. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.2% compared to 24.1% in the prior year period. Net income increased 8% to $360 million and diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $0.99 per share. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 9% from the quarter to $359 million and $0.99 per share, respectively. Quick summary of year-to-date financial results, total service revenue and total revenue both increased 9% to $2.4 billion. Management Solutions increased 10% to $1.8 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions increased 6% to $556 million. Op income increased 10% with a margin of 40.4% with modest expansion year-over-year and adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 12% to $731 million and $2.02 per share. Let's look at our financial position. It's strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of more than $1.3 billion and total borrowings of approximately $808 million as of November 30, 2022. Cash flow from operations increased and was $686 million for the first half of fiscal 2023, and this was driven by higher net income and changes in working capital. We paid out quarterly dividends at $0.79 per share for a total of $569 million during the first half of 2023. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was absolutely stellar, 46%. Now I'll turn to the guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2023. Our current outlook incorporates our first half results, obviously, in our view of the evolving macroeconomic environment. We have raised guidance in many areas but moderated the range for PEO and Insurance Solutions based on factors previously discussed. Updated guidance is as follows : Management Solutions revenue expected to grow in the range of 7% to 8%. PEO and Insurance Solutions expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million. Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 8% other income/expense net. And I'd just remind you that the net of our debt service plus earnings on our corporate portfolios, that number is now expected to be income of $5 million to $10 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow in the range of 12% to 14%. Guidance for margins and effective tax rate are unchanged, although we do anticipate leaning towards the upper end of the range on operating margin and the lower end of the range on effective tax rate. Turning to the third quarter. We currently anticipate that total revenue growth will be approximately 6% and that operating margin in the third quarter will be in the range of 43% to 44%. Of course, all of this is subject to our current assumptions, which could change if there are changes in the macro environment. We will update you again on the third quarter call, and I will refer you to our investor slides on the website for more information. I'll now turn the call back over to John. John Gibson : Thank you, Efrain. Tadd, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal : Thanks for taking my question this morning and happy holidays to you. I had a question on the insurance business. I'm just curious, you mentioned lower medical plan attachment and the mix shift to ASO. What do you think is the underlying driver there? Is there any other color or insight that you have in terms of why that sort of those dynamics are kind of kicking in right now? John Gibson : Yes. Look, I think I'll step back a little bit and then I'll zero-in on your question. I think our HR solutions, when you look at the combination of ASO and PEO, continues to grow at double-digit rates. We're very happy with the progress there. As we said, we surpassed the 2 million employees served. And if you go back and think about that, in fiscal year '19, we were at 1.2 million disclosed. So that's a 72% increase. And then you think about that, we had one year in COVID, where I think it\u2019s probably like 3%. So very solid growth in both of those products. I think when you look inside, the agency has struggled. When you look under, there's a lot of economic pressure I think, on employers and employees. Most of our insurance agency tends to attract first time employers who are offering insurance for the first time, a lot of new business start type of driven activity. And I think in this environment, I think even though they would want to offer insurance to their clients, I think they're finding that it's economically difficult for them to think about adding that product. And then when we look at the participation rate, the other dynamic there is you need two things. One, you need an employer to buy it; and then you need employees to contribute their fair share. We've also seen some decreases in employees who are electing not to participate in their employer plans. So you have those two dynamics, I can't connect the two directly. But certainly, when I look at the hours worked, when I looked at inflationary pressure of wages, I wouldn't be surprised if that's some of the economic decision that's being made there. Ramsey El-Assal: One follow-up for me. You also talked about Management Solutions higher product attachment cross-sell. Can you kind of update us on your strategy there? What levers you're using to execute on cross-sell and what inning we're in, in terms of that broader opportunity? John Gibson : Yes. Look, what we've seen across the board, our digital offerings, our online solutions continue to attract their driving efficiency inside companies. That's things that are looking for. You think about our time and attendance solutions. They're also dealing with more dispersed workforces. So that's driving demand, onboarding, recruiting and onboarding. So we still have a very tight labor market for small and medium-sized businesses. So our recruiting and onboarding experience has really driven demand, it's in partnership with Indeed. As a matter of fact, I think the last time we reported, we were somewhere around 1.8 million employees hired through this new onboarding -- hiring and onboarding experience, and we're approaching the 3 million mark in just six months since we last reported the number. So that's been very attractive as people are trying to attract and retain, and then our Retention Insights. So we go out, we have our HR professionals talking to our clients. It's interesting on the Retention Insights, we're actually doing behind the scenes insights to a data analytics team, and they were actually flagging clients that we think have an issue, and then we're proactively going out to them and having our HR consultants engage them in a conversation. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Bryan Bergin : Wanted to dig in here just on some of the leading indicators and the demand environment. So just since you reported last and then over the last few weeks, can you just talk about what you're seeing in that new demand across employer size as well and offering? John Gibson : Yes. Again, what I would tell you is, even though the -- it's a challenging and kind of a mixed macro environment, everything you read about the resiliency that we're seeing in the small and midsized businesses continues to be strong. So when we look at the leading indicators that we would be looking at of kind of the first signs of a downturn, we're simply not seeing those in our indicators at this time, and that's what we've reported here. I think there's certainly been a rare coaster effect from the COVID perspective. Certainly, when you look under the covers, I think our mid-market customers and larger customers seem to be doing better than our small customers and small customers seem to be doing better than the micro customers in terms of dealing with inflation and the recruiting scene. But when you look at the overall macro perspective, we're not seeing anything at this time in our indicators that would indicate any kind of downturn for small businesses. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Okay. That's good to hear. I guess just a follow-up on that. As we think about the macro assumptions underlying the second half outlook, can you just talk about what you're thinking about for client employment levels, had a business client loss or things like that? Efrain Rivera : I think pretty -- at this point, I think we're assuming an environment that's similar to what we saw in the first half. And with this caveat, Bryan, that as we've looked at quarter-over-quarter, you continue to see a pace that is moderating versus the previous quarter. I think that's the trend we think continues into through the end of the fiscal. So while it doesn't represent a sharp departure, we still see continuing signs of moderation as we go through the year. Now that assumed that the impact of the Fed's rate raising continues to have the same incremental impact it's had in the first couple of quarters. What do I mean by that? I mean, right now, what we see is it's having the effect of starting to tamp wage pressures. It's not having a dramatic impact on hiring especially in the SME firms that we serve. If that started to change, it would change our assumptions. Right now, we don't see that occurring. But right now, we're not at 5% short-term rates. We're going to have to monitor that. And there is just a note of caution that we have as we approach what they would consider their peak short-term interest. So no dramatic departure from the first half. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : I wanted to start just on Management Solutions with the raise of the revenue guidance there. Just which of the key operating metrics are you now bullish on? I mean is it pricing, retention, bookings, checks per client? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So driving that, Jason, is -- let me pick a couple of those out and say where we're stronger, where it's not as strong. So obviously, we expect client retention and revenue retention to remain strong. It's strong and we expect that to occur during the balance of the year. We're seeing a little bit more increase in unit and unit churn on the low end, that's to be expected given the mix of the client base over the last couple of years, but it's coupled with very strong client retention, so higher value clients we're retaining, which is what we want to do. On the check question, that's a good one because in the first half, we saw good checks per for payroll or pays per control growth in the first half. We don't expect it to be that strong in the back half of the year. So we expect that it moderates as we get into the second half of the year partly compares partly simply because of the amount of growth that we saw last year. So that -- but it still will be a positive contributor. We think that ERTC will still be a factor in the back half of the year, although I called it out Management Solutions that's moderating. It just won't moderate quite as much as we perceive it to be. And then we consider the demand environment to still be positive and obviously think that sales will remain positive we go through the year. So that's a little bit more color on each of those. John Gibson : Yes. And Jason, I would probably add to that. I mean we continue to see the demand for our HR solutions, both ASO and PEO. We like the demand. What we're seeing an increase in worksite employees and the retention in those has been very I mean historic record high when you look at our HR outsourcing businesses, both of them at record highs. So we've had solid revenue retention across -- at the macro level. And then when you look at what's going on in the HR area, very, very positive results, and that's certainly helping us as well. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Understood. My next question is just on the -- coming back to the insurance side of things. I mean, you talked about -- you talked about some macroeconomic effects that you think are causing that business to be a little softer than you would have anticipated. But are there any execution issues you feel you need to take a look at or anything that could border on structural challenge vis-a-vis cyclical. Just wanted to see if we can unpack that a little more? John Gibson : Yes. Well, Jason, let's talk a little bit because we've talked about the agency a little bit. I mean P&C has been a continued product. Again, remember, most of our P&C business is workers' comp, the vast majority of it to new start-up businesses. And that's been a very soft market for a period of time. So certainly, that has continued to be a drag and that has not turned around. I think when you look at the H&B side, which has been a little bit more impacted up and down as you went through this pandemic. It's what I kind of say, you have a little slower new business starts, so people less people we're talking to, and then you have the economic pressure of adding a benefit at that cost both from an employer and employee side. So I don't think there's anything terribly structurally. Now one of the things we're certainly doing is we're trying to make adjustments to our approach both in terms of driving more digital engagement on the P&C side. We're also doing a lot more going back to current clients on the H&B side, where we think we may have more success in converting them from existing benefit programs. And we're going to continue to look at expanding our insurance product portfolio to meet the demands of the marketplace with some things that may be more economical. But again, this is really a continued sluggishness with P&C and then this kind of lack of attachment and backup participation in H&B. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Happy holidays, and John, congratulations on the first call. I wanted to drill into the puts and takes on the guidance a little bit. I mean, there's been a pretty sizable step-up in float, which is pretty profitable. And then the swing factor on the other income is pretty profitable, too. But we're kind of holding the EBITDA and I know the other income is below the line, but the floats above, is there anything offsetting that, Efrain? Or is that a little conservatism? Just -- because it seems like your overperforming in some of the more profitable parts of the business as opposed to not and it doesn't seem like that's flowing through. So is there anything I'm missing there or just not thinking about that right? Efrain Rivera : No, no, not really, Kevin. I mean I think when you do the arithmetic, what you end up and the color that I gave you was that we saw ourselves more towards the top of the range. So there is flow through on that revenue. And in the back half of the year, we don't assume that 100% floats through, we look at the year position ourselves also to anticipate potential spending going into '24. We may end up outperforming that number but at this point, we do always approach with an element of caution and conservatism as we go through the year. Kevin McVeigh : That makes a lot of sense. And then can you remind us, Efrain, just what Fed funds is in that $100 million, $110 million in terms of from a Fed funds perspective? Efrain Rivera : Yes. We assume we're going to end up close to where the Fed is around a 5% terminal rate as we get into the spring. The -- I just caution that you can't simply take the portfolio and put that rate in because it will depend on what the balance between short term and long term is. And I've been saying throughout the year that what I want to do is position the portfolio. So we don't -- so if we're in a situation where the Fed decides to raise and then suddenly sharply cut, we're a little bit more protected than we were during the last cycle and when the same thing occurred. So -- but obviously, we're flowing that through the P&L. Operator : Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Samad Samana : Maybe just on the record sales performance. I guess, can you comment on bookings activity, both in aggregate and then maybe the linearity of the quarter and what you're seeing as we get closer towards the end of the year and as your clients adjust to maybe the changing macroeconomic environment? John Gibson : Yes. So we -- look, we continue to see very strong demand for our products and services. As I said, continue on the HR side, continue to see strength there, all of our digital products. We're not seeing a lot of change in the competitive landscape at this point at all. Again, we continue to find our clients are really struggling with dealing with inflation. And certainly, our technology solutions are making them more efficient. So we've got a definitely efficiency play there. We're also helping them with the ERTC. Again, remember, I think our average is over $150,000 per client that we're helping them. We've helped 50,000 clients, and that's become a big economic help to them. That's helping us. We continue to see strength in the 401(k) business as well as an attachment, a critical benefit that people want to have, their state mandates and that's becoming very popular as well. I mentioned time and attendance and all of our online services, this comprehensive group of online digital experiences that we're rolling out from recruiting. All of those are really resonating with the problems that small businesses are happening. Efrain Rivera : So to your question, by the way, I think you had me stumped there for a second as to the linearity of it. Here's my answer to that and you can tell me if I answered it correctly. So if I look at first half sales bookings growth, it was certainly solid strong. And you have to go back to how are we comparing now on the two-year stack pre-pandemic, and we compare favorably certainly to that period of time. But the question for this business is, as everyone on the call knows, Q3 is a really important quarter, our most important quarter. So generally, when we line up strong in the first half, we end up strong in the second half when we start to lob a little bit in the first half, a little bit tougher in the second half. I think to John's point, we're well positioned for the selling season. The only caveat I would have is that we have to get through the selling season to see how we come out to really kind of get a sense of where the year was by the time third quarter has rolled through. We're pretty much -- we pretty much know where we are for the year. So I think we're lined up well. I think the numbers would suggest that, and we're in the middle of it, won't report, part out more in the third quarter. Samad Samana : And then maybe just, I guess, a follow-up on your own. I think that's about what your customers are doing. Just -- and you said that you're at the expected staffing levels. How are you thinking about your own maybe hiring going forward in the sales and marketing organization? How are you guys planning for based on the assumptions you made in your own guidance as well? John Gibson : Yes. As we said, we're fully staffed, both in sales and service going in to the selling season, which is exactly where we want to be given the demand that we're seeing. And we're going to continue to monitor that. We're being very cautious in adding above that at this point in time. I would say we do see some opportunities for investment. As Efrain said, and we will make those investments in the selling season if we see the opportunity to promote certain products and services that we think are resonating in the market. So we're holding back to be able to do that. If we see some sort of change, we know what the levers are. As we've said, we're the best operators in the business. We're going to continue to do that. We've got our hands on the leverage, but we're not pulling them at this point because we're just not seeing that decrease in the demand that would merit that. Operator : Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Efrain or John, just thoughts on pricing, how it's taking? I know, John, you said the competitive environment isn't changing. So I'm wondering customers have reacted to the most recent price increases that you had to put in? John Gibson : Well, Kartik, I would say our average revenue per client is double digits. It's above even any of the pricing levels, and that's really driven by the value we're providing. And we've already talked about it, the attachment, the upgrading we're doing from the HCM to the HR solutions, the attachment we're seeing from our digital experiences that we're adding. So from a revenue per customer as well as a revenue per new sold customer, we actually are doing very, very well there. So I think it demonstrates the value and I think it demonstrates the pricing power that we have. Kartik Mehta : And then just looking at the balance sheet. Obviously, the balance sheet is in great shape. And if the economy slows and maybe valuations come down, just your thoughts on maybe buying back stock versus M&A opportunities? What makes more sense for Paychex? Efrain Rivera : I don't think anything has changed, Kartik, in the sense that if the right opportunities for M&A came along, we would obviously be constructive on those opportunities. We have a range of opportunities in the funnel that we're looking at. And sometimes we see opportunities that may be worth going after more aggressively at this point. I think that we have the normal set of opportunities that we have in the funnel. With respect to buying back shares, I don't think we've changed our outlook in terms of at this point buying back based on our desire to combat dilution. So I don't think a lot has changed in that sense. I do think the environment -- and John can also talk to this, but the environment looks more productive for doing both tuck-in acquisitions and a little bit larger scale M&A. And we're very interested in doing that. John Gibson : Yes. I think to add on to that, Kartik. Look, I think the market is changing for sure. We've always, I think, had a very similar position. The position has not changed. I think the opportunities are changing, meaning they're presenting themselves of more reasonable valuations. We always are, I think, known to be very conservative and good allocators of capital. And it's not that we've not been interested in doing M&A or going after some technology bolt-ons but the valuations have just been unreasonable for us to be able to cross that barrier. And at least what we're seeing is we're starting to see some moderation there. And we're going to continue to be as active as we have been in the past. And hopefully, we can get to a point where the market valuations match what we think is a reasonable amount to pay for some of these businesses that we're interested in. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Just thinking about wage inflation or just inflation in general. What's the direct effect for Paychex? Is it less attachment, less spending from the client that you'll end up seeing? John Gibson : Well, so let's talk about wage inflation. First of all, I'd probably tell you that we have wage inflation, but it's been moderating. If you look at our Paychex IHS index, we've been steady for the last three months at about 5%. And that's actually kind of moderated a little bit from the increases we were seeing before. When you think about the wages in certain parts of our business and certain pricing models in the PEO in particular, some of our pricing is based on a percentage of wage, similar to what's in the industry. So that can have some uplift. But in general, the wage rate does not have a big impact on our revenue. Bryan Keane : And it typically doesn't have a big impact on their appetite to buy attachments or spend more with you guys? John Gibson : Not really. I don't see that. I would have never seen that analysis that would indicate that. The one thing I would probably say, look, the number of employees, worksite employees is the key driver in our HR businesses, checks in the payroll side of the business, the more people that are employed, the more people that are getting checks, the better. One of the things that I would tell you is that we're seeing in terms of the impact of inflation on employees is they're now working more hours. That's one component that we see. A recent survey of the American Association Staffing actually found is 58% of adults are looking at potentially adding a second job we are beginning to see people getting checks at two different places within the client base. As you can imagine, that's a check as a check. And so again, if you see that type of -- where people are going and working more, working in more places, getting more checks, that's positive for our business. Bryan Keane : Got it. No, that's helpful. And then obviously, as you guys talked about the key selling season is happening over the next few months. What are your guys' expectations for new client growth? Is it -- I always think about 2% to 4%. Is it high end, low end of that as you head into the season? Efrain Rivera : Well, so Bryan, I think typically, we say 1% to 3%. We will see where we come out of the range there. We expect it to be a good season. I think that's about as much what I can say as we're in the midst of it. Operator : Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson. Eugene Simuni : I wanted to come back to the PEO insurance for a second, if you don't mind. A lot of questions have been answered on the insurance side of things. But I wanted to just double click on the PEO specifically. So putting the agency aside and even putting the issues with insurance attachment aside, which was talked about, can you just comment explicitly on what you are seeing in the bare bones PEO business, literally PEO works at employees, bookings trend there? I think that would be very helpful. Efrain Rivera : Yes. So I'll let John talk to sales, but I think that's a great question. And I just want to take a second to kind of, as you said, double, double click on the PEO and the elements of revenue that affect revenue growth there. So if everyone on the call knows the first thing in that, that revenue in insurance in the PEO is primarily derived from the State of Florida on the health care side. Workers' comp is different, but on the healthcare side. So it's a big number, but it's primarily going to be influenced by Florida. To John's point, we anecdotally saw some interesting things in the first half of the year where we had people who have insurance stayed with the PEO, but decided they didn't want insurance. And it was a little bit of an unusual situation. We didn't call out specific characteristics of the State of Florida in the first half of the year because, frankly, don't want to pile on that excuse as to what happened there, but Florida had an unusual idiosyncratic period in the first half of the year. Long story short, the level of attachment that we expected to see in that state in particular, didn't materialize. As I looked at it and we looked at it, we said what makes sense? Well, we don't expect, we expect the second half revenue in PEO will be stronger than the first half. But we're a little cautious based on what we're seeing with respect to insurance attachment. And so that's why we had an abundance of caution. We lowered the range for revenue on PEO in the second half. I think it's really important, all of that is the punch line to make this point, has no impact on margins or on net income. So we could easily have 5% or 6% PEO growth and have 8% or 9% depending on the on the mix of revenue, insurance versus admin that wouldn't have any impact on margins. So that's largely driven by softness on that side of the business, and I could be reporting, and we could be reporting them in the fourth quarter. We had a really sharp spike in insurance attachment. That's the reason we manage the business the way we do. We're not expecting to make money out of there. Obviously, we'd like it to be a bit higher than it is. But I think it's really important to remember that worksite employees, that's an important point. What we're seeing is we're seeing solid growth of worksite employees and PEO in the PEO business, which is one thing that encourages me in terms of the back half of the year. So we're not seeing softness in terms of worksite employees, and that's really the driver of profitability in the business. You don't have the work sites, you're not going to have it. So it's a little bit digging in, you asked the right question. when you look at it, it really -- the fundamentals beneath the issue of insurance looks solid. I'll let John talk to what's happening on the sales side? John Gibson : Yes. No. Look, our -- to Efrain\u2019s point, this insurance attachment thing is localized to Florida. Our attachment rate in the PEO for our clients in Texas has no impact on our revenue at all. And so the fact that it does in Florida has an impact. But look, I think the PEO value proposition is still strong. It's still very solid. You look at evidence of that. I look at our revenue retention and our retention of clients there is at near record levels, very strong. We continue to see a strong worksite employee growth. And so again, I feel really good about where we are positioned. We're fully staffed there. We're into the selling season and very confident that we have the right products and services for that market. So again, if dynamics in the market change, I would expect those are going to impact others just like they impact us. Eugene Simuni : Got it. Got it. Well, very comprehensive double-click, very helpful. And then for my follow-up, actually, I wanted to ask on the kind of HR management side of things. On a competitive landscape, I was curious if you can provide your thoughts on any competitive pressure you're seeing from the trend of embedding payroll into software solutions. So we're seeing, obviously, a lot of the payments providers, software providers looking to expand their offerings with other business modules, if you will, and payroll is always at the top of the list. They talk a lot about that. I was curious from you guys side, how successful do you think those efforts are? And are you seeing any competitive pressure? John Gibson : I would say that I've not seen a dramatic change in anything and not seeing any type of new entrants that are worrisome in terms of what I think about our growth. I think -- probably the other point I would make is that one of the things I think we will -- it will be interesting to see as we go into the selling season is some of the upstart competitors who don't need to necessarily make money whether or not they'll still be able to approach the market and marketing and marketing spend, et cetera, in the same way they have in the past. So we've already seen, I think, some of that dialing back. So not that I'm seeing in any of the data that I see that I'm seeing them having an impact. Efrain Rivera : And Eugene, I'd go back probably three, four years ago and one of the fintech providers embedded payroll and our stock traded down, I don't know, like 3% in the day, and I was getting calls about why and said look, such and such has an embedded solution on payroll. I think look, the surest way to stumble is to act arrogant, and we're not arrogant about those folks. We've looked at, by the way, some of the people that you cover and think there's an opportunity in the market for those solutions. They're just not a dramatic impact. We've never seen a dramatic impact on us because the other thing you need to think about or the other thing to consider there too is depending on what part of the market you're addressing there. Especially in [loan], there's a benefit to having some level of service attached to payroll, not obviously in the enterprise space or in the upper end of the market. And that ability for simple payroll, we've got that pretty much covered which were payroll. Operator : We'll take our next question from Peter Christiansen with Citi. Peter Christiansen : Welcome, John, and happy holidays to all. Efrain, I wanted to ask a question about -- you called out working capital as a benefit this quarter. Wondering if that's indicative of changing activity with some of your staffing clients? And if that's a tail even to perhaps what's going on more macro-wise? And then I just had a quick follow-up. Efrain Rivera : Well, great question, Pete. So the short answer to that is if you look at the first -- at the comparable period last year, the staffing business really rebounded significantly. And so we had a net use of working capital as the receivable balances grew. The staffing business continues to be pretty strong, staffing funding business, just so everyone on the call that's our Advance Partners business. But we're not -- we don't have the growth in receivables that we had last year. So as a consequence from a net in change in working capital perspective, we didn't have that use of funds. So that's really what's driving it.  And just a quick advertorial on the staffing funding business, it's doing well and we're continuing to see growth in that part of both our business and the market as a whole. Peter Christiansen : And then I just want to follow -- dig a little bit deeper into the last question, particularly dealing directly with merchants, on the merchant side, how are you guys -- are you guys pleased or wondering if you just qualify how things are going with channel sales? And I know you have a relationship with Clover, and I think you have some other channel distribution partners. Just if you could talk about the sales efficiency that you're seeing there, that would be helpful. John Gibson : Yes. I would say in our business development, we're continuing to add additional channels. It's still, I'd say, a small portion still when you look at where we're getting our clients is from our CPA partners, it's from our existing clients referring us. It's from digital marketing. And then we have a cadre of business development, we continue to add to them. So we continue to do that. I'd say I'm pleased, but I'm not saying that I see anything. Again, it goes back to my prior comments. I've not seen a major shift which says, \"Oh, my goodness, this is a big emerging trend or emerging threat.\" They're incremental, they're helpful. There's obviously a segment of the market that looks for that type of integrated solution and as Efrain said, as their needs get more complex, what we tend to find is they migrate into one of our HCM solutions and are getting into our HR products. I know I don't know if that makes sense. If it's simple, if you're looking for something very simple and the integrated is important, the minute you have one of these modules that sort of add-on and then you get into complexity. That's where the service model kind of breaks down and you kind of see this unbundling start to occur. So there's a portion of the market that I think it makes sense for. We're continuing to look at that. But again, when we look up at particularly our HR businesses and where we're seeing the need for our digital offerings, not so much. I think it's less important to those clients. Operator : We'll take our next question from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Great. And just a couple of follow-up questions for me. First on margins. It seems like we're pretty near peak levels right now. How should we think about the durability of these margin levels going forward? And particularly, a question we get a lot is if we were to see a recession, and revenue growth were to be impacted, what would -- how should we anticipate that would impact margins? And what levers do you have to get us to the higher end of your margin outlook versus perhaps going back to the lower end? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Let me answer it two ways and then I'll put it over to John. Look, I think, James -- and we get the question a lot, I think it's part of the transformation that the company has gone through over the last year, last, I would say, five years, in particular, especially post I'd remind everyone of the investments that we made post tax reform and that we delivered on. Our intent was to accelerate the transformation to look much more like a technology company than what we had been before, which was certainly a perfectly well-functioning tech services business but more technology. So you hear a lot of what we say, but don't, I think, see the background of it as much. We deploy a lot of technology in the background. And I say this in many of the calls where today's tech service is tomorrow's technology delivered by a set of technology tools on the back end. And we feel really passionate about the ability to deliver service but service delivered through state-of-the-art technology. What's the point of all of that? The point of all of that is that if you can do that and if you can do it successfully, then you get margin expansion of the type that we have been driving. We think there's still a long road to go in terms of our ability to fully optimize and digitize everything that we're doing. And as a consequence, we challenge ourselves every year to look at a range of potential investments that can drive margin improvement balanced by investments that also drive revenue growth. So we're trying to play those off. And the short answer is, yes, I think if you were -- five years ago, if you said we'd hit 40%, and then we'd be talking about the potential to expand beyond 40%, look, I wouldn't have known that with precision that we were going to be there, but that's exactly where we're at. There may come a day where we say, \"Hey, look, I don't think for the growth of the business, the level of investment we need to make in the business, we can really continue to leverage.\" But we're not at that point at this stage. I'll turn it over to John for comments too. John Gibson : Yes. I think you covered, Efrain. I mean I've said from the start, we are known as the best operators in the business, and that's something I'm very proud of to have been part of. And it's in our DNA, and we're going to continue to do that. And I do think we have some macro opportunities, and that is the digital adoption that's happening in the marketplace is a benefit. Employees and employers don't want to talk to us anymore. They want to get on our 5-star app, and they want to be able to do it themselves whenever they want to do it. That adoption helps them and it helps us. It provides a better client experience. We're investing in that, looking for ways to drive efficiency there. So that macro adoption and then what we're doing in digitizing our back office is another opportunity at different points, but I think we're still -- we still have runway on and we're still continuing to invest in and push in and continue to move on. So I think there's plenty of opportunity for us to continue to look for ways to not only provide digital solutions to our clients but also continue to digitize what we're doing in the back office. And that's in areas of the business. I mean you look at our digital sales unbelievable growth in that mode of selling over the last decade and over the last five years as we've invested in that. We've launched a digital onboarding capability that will be fully operational for the low end of our market across the business starting in January. So looking forward to that test and learn. And we have several other test and learn investments coming out of our November strategy session that are all built around driving additional growth and driving further digital adoption across the business. James Faucette : That's helpful. And I guess a related question. I mean, it sounds like you guys are going into the selling season well-staffed, and I know that has been a point of concern earlier. But I'm just on that topic and more broadly of service levels. I guess are you seeing that as an indicator of just a little bit of a change in the hiring market generally? And then on -- and as we dig into the efficiencies, are the technology investments, et cetera, allowing you to increase the typical client count for an existing account manager? And how has that been trending? Just wondering about kind of the hiring environment for your own needs as well as points of efficiency that you're realizing right now? John Gibson : Yes. I would say the hiring environment for us. I think like most people reporting has stabilized, much different than it was probably a year ago when we were sitting here a year ago, we were not fully staffed to where we would like to be entering the selling season and the year-end season. And we sit here today, fully staffed, fully trained and prepared to execute going into that. So it's a much different hiring environment for us as well. And we are continuing to drive productivity as well. Operator : We'll take our next question from Mark Marcon with Baird. Mark Marcon : Happy holidays, John and Efrain. I just want to save you a little effort. I've got a little gift for you, just to save you some time on all your callbacks, because I'm getting this question a lot on live. Can you just break out the PEO and Insurance Services, that $273.3 million? Can you break it out between the agency component versus the PEO component? And then... Efrain Rivera : So go ahead. Mark Marcon : And then to break down what you ended up seeing in terms of the year-over-year change within those and this is more than double clicking, but it will save you a lot of time. Just how much of an impact there was with regards to the change in terms of the uptake of the health insurance and the property and casualty, the workers' comp? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So Mark, I would point all of the good investors who are asking you those solid questions to a chart that we included at the beginning of this fiscal year, end of last fiscal year, which broke out PEO and insurance by percentages. So if you go there and look at that, you'll see the exact percentages and the percentages as of the end of the year really didn't change significantly in the first half of the year. So that's the first part. The second part is roughly half and half is H&B and half -- I'm sorry, roughly half of the insurance revenue is H&B and the other half is P&C, as John said, but that's largely workers' comp insurance. And so I will only describe it qualitatively, which is to say that we're still seeing growth low single digits on -- I'm sorry, we're still seeing growth in H&B and on a P&C -- P&C itself workers' comp in the quarter was flat to down. So the impact of a really soft insurance market, which was different than it was three, four years ago is weighing on that. So in summary, I would say, look at the end of the quarter, end of the last fiscal year, I got a breakout on Management Solutions and also on PEO and insurance, it's there. You'll see what it is. And then you can say that in the insurance, roughly, it's half workers' comp and half H&B. We still see growth in H&B, and to John's point, that should grow as smaller clients become more constructive on buying insurance. Workers' comp is the one that's exerting a drag on that entire segment. Mark Marcon : Got it. And if we strip out the insurance component, is the PEO business ex the insurance component still growing high single digits, low double digits? Efrain Rivera : I won't split it out that way because it's a little bit tough with the value proposition, Mark. What I'd point to is what I said earlier in the call that we're getting good worksite employee growth, and that's kind of where we're focusing it. It's hard to strip it out that way because then you'd have to do a deep dive on what's happening in Florida versus other parts of the market. But when you look across of the markets that we serve and look at worksite employee growth with -- and certainly in most of the major markets, we're seeing good worksite employee growth. Mark Marcon : And what was -- I'm sorry, I'm sure you mentioned it before, it's in one of the releases, but what was the worksite employee growth? Efrain Rivera : We did not say that. And good try, though, Mark. We didn't say it. We'll report on it at the end of the year. What we did what we did say and what John said is that we've had significant worksite employee growth, both in the ASO and PEO model, and we surpassed 2 million to 1 million employees. Remember, Mark, one other thing for everyone. We don't force a client into either the PEO or ASO, we're unlike a lot of other providers. So we say to a client, you can have either depending on what you value in the bundle. And so what we're seeing across both of those solutions is strong demand. Mark Marcon : Great. And then on Managed Solutions, obviously, solid and better than expected, better than what we modeled and better than what you've guided. But one question that I got from some investors is basically why did Management Solutions slow in Q2 relative to 1Q? Efrain Rivera : Okay. That was a good question. I answered that one after first quarter. But the short answer to the question, Mark, I'd say, bucket it three ways. And the first thing is that significant growth in pace per control or checks per payroll in the quarter versus the prior quarter. That was one. The second part was that ERTC was a significant contributor in the quarter. It wasn't as great a contributor in in the second quarter. In other words, it wasn't as large incremental growth. And then third was everything else, which was positive. Mark Marcon : Got it. Great. And then, John, you mentioned the really cool innovative tools during the last quarterly discussion, particularly the voice activated solution. I'm wondering if you can give us a sense for like for your most innovative tools, what sort of uptake are you currently seeing? John Gibson : Well, I mentioned one where clients are having the issues, which is really on the hiring and onboarding is one. So if you look at that when we last reported, I mentioned that we had launched that product in beta and then announced it. At that point, we had 1.1 million -- I think it\u2019s 1.8 million maybe employees that had actually been hired through that process. As I sit here today, we're we will approach 3 million people hired to that platform. So give you some idea of the use of that, how frequently that's being used, and that's very popular. The Retention Insights is another one that we've had very good uptake and utilization of and the impact, quite frankly, so getting good reviews there. Mark Marcon : Yes. I was talking about the... John Gibson : 401(k), time and attendance, all of those other online traditional products doing well as well. Mark Marcon : I was referring to the Google voice activated solution. John Gibson : Yes, yes. So we launched that. It's -- we're just starting to launch that, and we're watching to see how customers adapt to it and utilize it. Operator : Our last question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien-Tsin Huang : I just wanted to ask on the retention side. I know it's record retention, has been doing really well. And I've been getting a lot of questions around SMB and retention, bankruptcy risk here going into possible recession? I know Efrain, you've shared this before. But can we revisit what it did in past downcycles. And I would imagine that you would do probably a little bit better. I think you always do a little better than people here. But I would think you would do better here given the shifts in the platform, the investments in tech. So -- but I just want to revisit that before we close out the year. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Yes. So I mean if you go back to '07, '08, '09, where the business was rough -- Tien-Tisn you would know, this was roughly about 80% payroll and 20% HRS, I think get about troughed, I guess, depending on which side you're looking at, at about 77% retention on a unit basis. I don't know what the revenue retention was back then. But we were down to about 23% attrition. Now there were a lot of reasons why that's certainly a lower, lower, lower, lower band. But not to mention the fact, Tien-Tsin, as everyone on the call knows that right now, if we just isolate pure what we would call payroll, that's less than half of what we sell. So the rest of the stuff when you act in our model creates and generates better retention. So now you put yourself in a completely different position even in PEO. So I think the factors there dictate that you're going to have a very different outcome than you would have back in '07, '08, '09.  One other point that I would add to that. I mentioned in the -- during my comments that we did see -- we are seeing more elevated churn in the micro segment than perhaps a year ago. There's a mix element to that that's not -- if you want to understand and call me, it's not worth going into here. But from the -- and we anticipated that, by the way. But from a revenue retention standpoint, we still are very, very solid. And those are the clients that you're less likely to see churn in a downturn. So that's my long-winded answer to your question. Tien-Tsin Huang : And my quick follow-up. I know there's a lot of margin questions here. The overperformance in the first half, any sub prices or what would you attribute or rank, the big contributors to the margin overperforming here so far? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Tien-Tsin, I hate to use kind of a very generic answer to the question, but it is the very generic answer to the question. We had an expense plan and would beat it. So there was some mix effect. I mean, I don't want to say that Management Solutions overperforming the way it did, in fact it did. So I think that's part of it. But also expenses were better in the first. Operator : Thank you. And we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back to Mr. John Gibson for any additional or closing remarks. John Gibson : Thank you, Tadd. Well, at this point, we'll close the call. I would like to thank you for your support during my first call as President and CEO. I look forward to getting to know each and every one of you better in the future. And we've got a chance to talk to some of you, I'm sure we'll get a chance to talk to more. If you're interested in a replay of the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 90 days. Again, I want to thank you for your support of Paychex. I hope all of you and your families have a happy holiday and Happy New Year. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's call. We appreciate your patience. You may disconnect at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Paychex Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this call will be recorded, and I will be standing by if you should need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. John Gibson. Please go ahead, sir. John Gibson : Thank you, Todd. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our discussion of the paychex third quarter fiscal year '23 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ending February 28. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I'm going to start the call today with an update on the business highlights and then Efrain will review our financial results and outlook for fiscal year '23. We'll then open it up for any of your questions. As you saw in our press release, we delivered solid financial results for the third quarter with total revenue of 8% and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 12%. Thanks to the outstanding efforts of our employees we completed a successful selling and calendar year-end season with strong sales volumes and revenue retention for the quarter. We continue to see a stable macro environment and demand for our solutions. Our unique value proposition is clearly resonating in the market. Small and midsized businesses continue to show remarkable resilience as seen in our job at index in the last two months as they contend with a constantly changing labor market, inflation, increasing regulations and rising interest rates. Before we get into the third quarter results, I want to take a minute to address the recent volatility in the U.S. banking market as a result of two highly publicized bank closings. We have no cash, restricted cash and investments deposited within Silicon Valley Bank or Signature Bank, and we've met all client fund obligations related to employee payment services and remittances to applicable tax or regulatory agencies. We continue to monitor this situation and believe that our existing client funds held cash, cash equivalents and investment balances are more than sufficient to meet all client fund obligations. We remain ready as we were when the crisis was unfolding to help businesses and their employees whose payroll processing or direct deposits may have been impacted by these bank closures. Paychex has a long-standing track record for being a stable place for customers, employees and investors during all types of macroeconomic situations and crisis, and we demonstrated that once again. The selling season was positive in terms of both revenue and volumes in a very highly competitive environment. In particular, demand has remained strong for our HR outsourcing solutions though as we've reported in prior quarters, we continue to see a trend of client shifting preferences for our ASO model over the PEO model. In the third quarter, we saw revenue retention remaining near record levels and normalization of uncontrollable losses at the very low end of the market. The focus and investment we continue to put in our high-value clients is making the difference in the customer experience. In addition, the advisory assistance we provide our clients is critical in these challenging times. Our retention for our HR outsourcing businesses, both ASO and PEO stand at an all-time record high year-to-date. PEO and Insurance Solutions continue to show lower health insurance attachment and enrollment inside those clients that are attaching. This is specifically impacting our PEO in the Florida market and the softer rates for workers' compensation insurance continue to impact the property and casualty part of our insurance agency. We expect these trends to continue early into the next fiscal year and normalize as the year progresses. Paychex is uniquely positioned with a continuum of solutions designed to help businesses in any macro environment. We help them recruit and train employees gain access to capital and provide valuable benefit packages such as insurance and retirement. Through our innovative technology, compliance and HR expertise, we are here to help businesses drive efficiency within their HR processes, which therefore frees a valuable time for them to focus on growing the business. Competing for and retaining employees remain a challenge for today's workforce. And I want to commend Congress and the President for signing the recent SECURE Act 2.0, which will introduce a range of new opportunities for businesses looking to introduce a retirement benefit and make their employee value proposition more competitive. We have begun to launch campaigns to educate the market on the SECURE Act 2.0 and continue to position Paychex as the industry leader in retirement plans that we are. We are working on strategies to leverage our strength in this market and capitalize on this opportunity in the years ahead. As higher interest rates and disruptions in the banking system have both impacted the cost and access of capital for many small and midsized businesses, we have fully embraced this challenge to help them out by proactively assisting our clients and prospects with obtaining financial assistance available to them through non-traditional financial partnerships and through government programs such as PPP and the ERTC program. We continue to see strong demand for our full-service ERTC solution. Many of the businesses we've helped are leveraging their new financial flexibility to reinvest in new solutions, such as a retirement plan, or one of our integrated HCM technologies. Recently, our ERTC service was recognized with a Stevie Award for helping businesses obtain critical financial support. In uncertain times, people look for stable, trusted advisers to help them succeed. I am proud that we have recently been recognized as one of the most admired, one of the most ethical and one of the most innovative companies by several prominent and respected brands. We remain one of Fortune's most Admired Companies in 2023. And for the 15th time, we were named among one of the most ethical companies in the world by Ethisphere. This is a select group of companies that show exceptional commitment to ethical operations, compliance performance and governance and risk practices, including strong commitments to ESG and diversity, equity and inclusion. And today, we are announcing that we have been named to Fortune's list of America's most innovative companies for 2023 due to the innovation we've shown in our products, processes and culture. These awards are the result of the dedication of our 16,000-plus employees who daily are supporting our clients and helping them succeed and doing business the right way every day. Very proud of the team, and I'm very proud of Paychex. There's no question that we are a well-managed and stable market leader that people can depend on. We have a long-standing track record of being there for our customers when they need us most, and we continue to be well positioned to help them through the HR challenges they are facing and whatever comes their way in the future. Now, I'll turn it over to Efrain who will take you through our financial results for the third quarter. Efrain Rivera : Thanks, John. Good morning to everyone on the call. I'd like to remind you the customary things I remind you that during these conversations, we're going to talk about forward-looking statements. Items like EBITDA, non-GAAP measures, please refer to our press release for more information on these topics. I'll start by providing some of the key points for the quarter and finish up with a review of our fiscal 2023 outlook. Total revenue for the quarter, as you saw, grew 8% to $1.4 billion. Total service revenue increased 7% to $1.3 billion. Obviously, we're benefiting from increase in interest rates. Management Solutions revenue increased 7% to $1 billion, driven by additional product attachment, HR ancillary services. It's largely what we've discussed previously, our ERTC product and price realization, we continue to see strong attachment of our HR solutions, retirement and time and attendance products. Demand for our ERTC service remains strong and contributed approximately 1% to revenue growth in the quarter. Demand for this product along with our internal execution, have continued to exceed our expectations, while ERTC has been a tailwind, and we expect demand to continue into fiscal year '24. It will eventually become -- will eventually moderate and become a headwind as we progress through next year -- next fiscal year. Beyond Insurance Solutions revenue increased 6% to $321 million, driven by higher revenue per client and growth in average worksite employees. The rate of growth was impacted by factors previously discussed, including lower medical plan sales and participant volumes, along with the mix shift to ASO as John called out. We expect these trends to normalize as we progress through fiscal 2020, meaning a little bit more of a balance between PEO and ASO. Interest on funds held for clients increased significantly to $35 million in the quarter, primarily due, as you know, to higher average interest rates. Total expenses were up 8% to $769 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher headcount, wage rates in general course to support growth in our business. Op income increased 9% to $612 million, with an operating margin of 44.3%, a slight expansion over the prior year period. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.3% compared to 22.3% in the prior year period. The prior year period included a higher volume of stock-based comp -- and stock-based comp payments and the recognition of a tax credit related to our development of client-facing software that generated the difference in rates. Net income increased 9% to $467 million and diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.29 per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 12% for the quarter to $1.29 per share. Let me quickly summarize the results for the first nine months of the fiscal year. Performance has been strong. Total service revenue increased 8% to $3.7 billion, and total revenue was up 9% to $3.8 billion. Management Solutions was up 9% to $2.8 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions up 6% to $877 million. Op income increased 9% with a margin of 41.8%. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 12% to $1.2 billion and $3.31 per share. Our financial position remains strong, as you can see, with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of more than $1.6 billion. Total borrowings of approximately $808 million as of February 28, 2023, cash flow from operations, again, solid for the first nine months was at $1.3 billion and with an increase from priority driven by higher net income and changes in working capital. We've had our quarterly dividends at $0.79 per share for a total of $854 million during the nine months of fiscal 2023 year 12-month rolling return on equity was the seller superb for 47%. Now let me turn to our guidance. For the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2023, our current outlook incorporates our results for the first nine months in our view of the evolving macroeconomic environment. We have raised guidance on certain measures based on performance this past quarter, updated guidance is as follows : Management Solutions revenue now expected to grow slightly above 8%. We previously guided to a range of 7% to 8%. PEO and Insurance Solutions outlook is unchanged at growth in the range of 5% to 7%, although we anticipate it to be towards the lower end of the range. We expect Q4 PEO and Insurance Solutions growth to be below 5% due to the factors that we've talked about through much of the year. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $100 million to $105 million. Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 8%. Other income and expense net is now expected to be income of $10 million to $15 million, obviously due to higher interest rates. Remember, we met interest income there with our expense on the debt. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow in the range of 13% to 14%. We previously guided to growth of 12% to 14%. So we tightened the range, obviously, one quarter left. Guidance for margins and effective tax rates are unchanged, but we do anticipate being on the higher end of the range for operating margin and the lower end of the range for effective tax rate. We currently are in the middle of our annual budget process and are working on expectations for next fiscal year. As you know, this is challenging for a number of different reasons, not the least of which are expected outcomes in terms of interest rates and also economic environment. We'll provide final guidance for fiscal 2023 during fiscal 2023's fourth quarter earnings call in June. However, let me share some of our preliminary thought process around fiscal 2024. On a preliminary basis, we believe that the exit rate in the fourth quarter is a decent approximation for total revenue growth for 2024. This should result somewhere in the range of 6% to 7%. And again, we got more to do there, but just giving you what our thought process is at the moment. And it's heavily dependent on what we think will happen with interest rates during the year. And at this point, our assumptions are conservative. Management Solutions is expected to be lower as a result of moderating ERTC revenues. We called that out last year didn't happen. It actually went the other way. We do think it's going to happen next year. And then PEO and Insurance revenue growth is expected to trend higher as we progress through the year with moderation in some of the headwinds we have experienced this year primarily around insurance attachment and also, as we called out mix shift to ASO. We remain committed to improving margins and we anticipate that operating margin will expand at this stage in the range of 25 to 50 basis points for fiscal 2024. Of course, all of this is subject to our current assumptions, which can change, especially if there are significant changes to the macro environment, which at this stage, we are not seeing. I'll refer you to our investor slides on our website for more information. And now, let me turn the call back over to John. John Gibson : Thank you, Efrain. With that now being complete, Todd, we'll open up the call for any questions people have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Congratulations. Just really, really strong results here. I don't know, John or Efrain, maybe -- and I know it's preliminary Efrain, but the 2024 looks pretty similar to '23, and there's a lot of crosscurrents from a macro perspective. And you folks tend to be pretty conservative. Maybe help us understand some of the puts and takes? Is it maybe there's a little bit more pricing and just any base underlying assumptions around unemployment because, again, just really, really outcome. I'm just trying to understand maybe that a little bit more. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Let me -- I'll let John talk a little bit more to kind of what our thinking is from a macro perspective. But Kevin, just to kind of address some of the higher level assumptions that go into the plan. I called out the fact that ERTC is not going to be the headwind -- I'm sorry, the tailwind that it was this year. We called that out last year, but definitely going to happen next year or I wouldn't say definitely. I will say, we have a very high degree of belief that we won't see it. However, you're going to see that more in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. So, that's the first thing, thing I'd say. If we look back at where we started this year, we're getting a nice macro uplift from employment as we started the year. That seems to have run its course. It is not going the other way. But at this stage, what we're seeing is that there's been a pretty significant moderation in terms of employee adds and that's happened as we progress through the year. So, those two things are -- will become headwinds as we go through the year. Interest rates I called out. The first half of the year, I think we've got some sense of where we are. So, where we're at, the market does too, what is really hard to understand what happens in the second half of the year and whether we start going in reverse on interest rates. We're taking steps to position the portfolio to be able to deal with that. That's what happens. But no one1 knows there. Now that's all the stuff that's headwind. No positives. We think HR continues to be strong. We think as John pointed out, we think retirement continues to be strong, where we think that HCM continues to proceed well. We think PEO, which has been a little bit of a tailwind to growth this year. It does do better next year. The Insurance business that we call out PEO, a lot of the moderation on the growth rate in PEO insurance coming from insurance, we think that starts to improve as we go into next year. And then we have the normal level of cost discipline in the business that drives the results that we're anticipating in 2024. So that's a broad overview of, Kevin, numbers we've put together. I'll let John talk to macro and any other parts of the business we need to call out. John Gibson : Yes. Yes. Kevin, keep in mind that we've certainly seen a reference and really expected to see some moderation. I mean, we don't expect another 4.5 basis points increase in interest rates that we don't expect the type of hiring that we saw from the HCM. It's hard to believe that the great resignation was just last year, a year away. So certainly, we've had the benefit of staffing up. But we're not seeing any contraction moderation. And in fact, if you look at our job index, which has been a great indicator of kind of small business health and what we've seen in both January and February that we've reported, it's actually an increase in the index. And we have not seen that through all of this fiscal year. So these are the really first two months where we've seen an increase in the index and also saw some moderation in wage inflation as well. So, we're certainly not seeing it. We haven't reported March yet, but I can tell you we continue not to see anything there. Demand for our products, the HR products, the online products that we're offering HCM products of the 401(k) effort is really, really strong. I mean, we had a strong sales quarter in the second quarter and the third quarter was actually better than that even on a relative basis quarter-to-quarter from prior periods. So, we're seeing good demand in what I would say, moderation stabilization. We're certainly closely watching all of the indicators, but we're not seeing things. We've got a very -- the other thing I would point out on a macro basis, there's a lot of noise in the system. And I think it's important to say, we have a very diverse client base. And I think it's fair to say, Paychex, we're one of the main street small and midsized business company. We're not that still Silicon Valley. We're not focused on one particular vertical or we're not heavily weighted here or there. And so we tend to represent what's going on in Main Street. And I don't think Main Street small business owners have been reckless in hiring or requisite spending or able to spend more than they make. And so again, they struggle through this and we've been helping them get through it. So, our retention has been strong as well and particularly where accounts in our HR advisory products, both PEO and ASO again at record levels. So, we have a good degree of confidence that our value proposition is resonating with our current clients. We still think there's a ton of opportunity inside our client base to provide them further assistance. And while we've seen until towards ASO versus PEO this year, I always look at it this way. Those are ASO clients are Paychex clients and we'll be talking to them again next year about whether or not it's the right time and whether or not you've got the right benefits offering that now meets their needs, and we're certainly doing a lot of work there to try to make sure we've got the right continuum of insurance products to meet the market conditions for small businesses today. So I feel like, look, this labor challenge that we have is not going to go away. And I don't think the complexities of hiring people is going to go away. And I think that bodes well for how we've positioned ourselves, both from an HCM perspective, our technology is driving efficiencies and it's helping people manage remote workers. It's helping them attract workers and quite frankly, our HR advisory services are paying big dividends. So I hope that gives you some color on what we're seeing. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Just to dig into fiscal '24 guidance a bit more. Could you walk through some of the underlying drivers of Management Solutions revenue growth for next year and a little greater depth? And in particular, if you could let's say, start with the critical year-end selling season, which you've just gone through, you've indicated it was strong. If you could kind of walk through kind of what parts of the bookings were particularly strong within your client base, small end like sure payroll versus kind of more of the core payroll processing business, and then in addition to that, if you could comment on your expectations for client revenue retention next year and also for pricing? Efrain Rivera : Okay. Let me break it into two pieces, and then do let John comment on the selling season. So David, look, to put the revenue plan together for Management Solutions. I'd say you've got to -- you've got to get several dimensions reasonably right. The first is obviously what we expect from a client growth perspective, and John can talk to what we saw during the selling season. What I mean is unit growth in terms of sales. The second part is what do you expect from a pricing standpoint, too early to talk exactly what we're going to do. But those two components, both client growth and also -- and also pricing or part of our assumptions going into next year. You want to get attachment, continued growth on the ancillary products in the bundled suite fluting time and attendance, HR administration. And then increasingly, within Management Solutions, retirement and HR drive a lot of growth. And we're assuming strong years within both of those products, partly on the return side based on what John said. So you put all those together, and that forms the basis of our thought process around Management Solutions. And then PEO and insurance, we expect to grow faster than we've seen this year in part because of some of the headwinds we feel will abate as we get into next year, although that may still be evident in Q1. You framed the question correctly in the sense that if we come out of the selling season, and we haven't felt like we've had some of our objectives, it becomes a little bit more challenging to put the plan for '24 together, but John called out the fact that we thought we had good performance in the selling season. We obviously are not giving percentages at this point. We think after Q4, we gave you a lot of detail about client base, et cetera, and we'll talk about that. But I'll let John talk to what we were seeing during the selling season. John Gibson : Yes. No, I think, David, the key point was is we had both strong revenue production -- new revenue production and good volume production across the core business and then really just continue to see this accelerated level. I mean, we were growing our HR businesses. We're growing a good healthy clip before the pandemic and when the pandemic hit, we started to come out and they accelerate. And we're really seeing strong growth there, strong growth in retirement services, our online services, time and attendance, the other bundles that we're offering retention insights. We're just seeing a lot of traction in our products and services and we saw it in the third quarter. And I said the third quarter was a step-up from the second quarter, we felt pretty good about the second quarter. So -- and it was a very highly competitive environment. I would say there's a lot of aggressive competitors out there, and I think our products and our sales team did a great job on executing. Also, the other thing I feel good about in that quarter is we sell a lot of our business, only 50% of our new clients come to us from strategic partnerships, and we had a good year-over-year increase there. And again, I think what's going on there, not only as our products and services resonating, but I think people that are advising clients are beginning to put a preference on, hey, if I'm going to advise my clients were to go, maybe they need to be in a nice safe place where I don't have to have worries about whether or not their employees are going to get paid. So, I think that's also helped us in the third quarter as well. David Togut : Just pivoting to the float Efrain. How are you positioning the float if the Fed is almost done raising short-term interest rates? Efrain Rivera : So, that's an interesting point, David. I wonder whether they're almost been raising short interest rates. I tend to agree with you, but I'm not so certain about it. But the levers you have there is what percentage you have long term versus what percentage you have short term? And where do you lock -- where you lock long-term rates and over a period of time, so you can manage what happens on the downside of the cycle. So, we're starting to extend duration now because we're of the conviction that interest rates seem to be getting close to some sort of peak. Having said that, my prognostication skills on this or not anything anyone should take to the bank, but I do think from a portfolio management perspective, it's probably better to start going longer now for us. We were shorter earlier in the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: Efrain, can I ask you control down a little bit in terms of the factors that are giving you confidence that the insurance side of PEO will improve next year. Just curious about the drivers or sort of reasoning behind that expectation. Efrain Rivera : Yes. So, two things, Ramsey, it's interesting. It's been an unusual year in the sense that we've seen softness in insurance inside the PEO, and we've seen softness in insurance particularly health care insurance, in our agency. I'd start with the kind of obvious point that -- at some point, people do need health insurance. And at some point, as clients grow within the PEO, we add more clients. We're going to get more health care attachment. What's happened this year is that in the PEO in particular, you have renewals that occur in the fall and then you have renewals that occur at the beginning of the year. And if in that cycle, you don't get what you expected. You basically have to wait for some period of time if we start all of that process a little over again. So, we -- as we went through the year -- in the first half of the year, but okay, we're going to come out of the year with robust insurance as we get to the end of the year, it was better, but it wasn't what we expected. On the agency side, it's been moderating as we've gone through the year. And we've gone through cycles like this over seems attachment is lower and then it picks up. So part of it is almost a new reversion phenomenon that we think will occur. But the second part is we put a number of different initiatives that don't bear immediate fruit, but we think we'll bear fruit as we go into next year. One thing that's really interesting final point on that, John, just to highlight something John said, which is this preference for ASO versus PEO is a permanent preference for many clients eventually that want a PEO solution because they want the benefit of and we're expecting that we're going to see more of that as we head into next year. So while PEO performance, I would just highlight the PEO performance has been lower than what we anticipated during the year. It's still been growing at a decent clip. It's being somewhat attenuated by the insurance business, which has been very, very sluggish through the year. John Gibson : Yes. I would add to that, I think it's important to understand that particularly on the insurance attachment side in the PEO, remember, that's a lot of pass-through revenue, not a lot of margin. But it's a big dollar number. So a small percentage change in any direction has probably an over-weighted impact on the revenue in the PEO, right? And so extra 1% or 2% and then another 1% or 2% participation within the base, I think, is critical. And to Efrain's point, you have this opportunity to reset your insurance portfolio every open enrollment, and you're hoping that you have the right portfolio of cost and the type of plans that people can afford and they want to gravitate to and what they're going to do. And that cycle comes up every fall and into the winter. So certainly, we're taking a lot of data. We're doing a review of every market for the PEO and looking at our health insurance line up, making sure it's competitive. We're taking an affordable for clients. We're talking to our clients. We're already in the process beginning to reset that and talk about that reset. So, we're confident that we'll have the right lineup and the right opportunity, and then as Efrain said, historically, most of Paychex PEO sales really prior to our acquisition of Oasis was coming from upgrading ASO clients into the PEO business, a lot of inside the base. Now it's far more outside the base, but we still have that capability inside the base. So, we think there's additional opportunity inside our client base to upgrade them to PEO and that not only increases the revenue, but it also increases the lifetime value of the customer to us, it's the right thing to do for the business, and we'll be looking at plans to do that as we go into next year as well. Ramsey El-Assal: Let me sneak one follow-up, you called out higher revenue per client as a driver in the quarter. And I'm just curious, over time, have you seen the kind of overall growth algorithm of the business shift more such that, that higher rev per client metric is sort of more important. I guess the underlying question is, do you expect sort of ongoing gains there to sort of persist or is it -- was there something a little more lumpy about it that we should be aware of? Efrain Rivera : No. For sure, I mean, if you look at -- if you parse all the data, I'm not sure you get it from all of the public fiscal you get pretty close. You've seen persistent growth in revenue per client. So I think we've been very skillful at finding new opportunities, both with product attachment, but also the ability to create new products and services within our client base to drive that revenue higher. So yes, we can talk about an algorithm that's about units and price, or we can talk about an algorithm that's really around revenue per client and revenue per client has become more important, certainly in the last five years. John Gibson : I think it's important, Ramsey, keep in mind, we're in states where we're driving more value to the customer and both through our technology as well as our advisory services and that value is driving retention. It's driving pricing power, and it's driving an openness to add additional products and services over time. So the old traditional model we've always had, which is we've always been able to drive price increases over time to cover our cost increases. We've been able to go into the base and drive attachment. I would lay on top of that because we focus so much on the HR value proposition and driving customers up our kind of value continuum, that the other benefit we're seeing here is revenue retention. And now they're looking at us as their trusted adviser and they're saying, I want my 401(k) with Paychex, I want my time in time and attendance with Paychex. I want my other digital offerings from Paychex. I want my insurance from Paychex. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Daniel Maxwell : This is Daniel Maxwell on for Andrew today. Sort of similar to the last question, but specifically on WSE growth in the PEO and ASO client base, if you can break apart, how much of that is coming from existing clients versus new clients and attrition? And any color on why there has been a preference for ASO over PEO and the reasons you expect that balance to normalize? Is that just coming from increased confidence in up-selling to PEO? Or is there anything else in there? Efrain Rivera : Yes, Daniel. So, we've seen healthy growth in WSEs across ASO and PEO. We don't separately break them out, but both have been growing. So, we're seeing positive results on that side of the equation, splitting it out between new adds versus existing base. The reality is that because the existing base is so large, it dwarfs the impact of new adds from a WFE perspective, especially when you consider loss. And so, we've seen good growth on WSE that makes us, as John said, more positive about the general value of our HR advisory services like both cross ASO and PEO. I'll let John talk through shifting preferences in a given year between ASO and PEO. John Gibson : Yes, Daniel. I think that what you're seeing is -- and again, some of this is just speculation on our part, but when we see clients that had our insurance and we go through enrollment and where they had 25 employees that bought the insurance, now they have 22 or you see clients that had your insurance in the PEO and decide that they no longer going to have insurance or offer insurance for your employees. I just think you're in a position where given some of the uncertainty, people being cautious of adding a benefit. Now it's interesting, they know they need to have benefits to attract or retain employees. So, 401(k) is doing very, very well. It's a lower cost benefit. It's a lower commitment. And now when we take the SECURE Act 2.0, technically, if you're a 20 to 50 million company, a person company, you now can basically get a 401(k) setup and have all of the setup costs and the annual cost covered through tax credits. So, those are things they're adding. But the health insurance, because of the size of the expenditure and the fact of matter is once you start offering it. It's a pretty long-term commitment you're making. I think there's a degree of hesitance to that. And again, as I said, I think there's more we can do in going out and looking for more innovative product sets that gives access, affordable access to health care for our employees and our teams are working on that. As we go through the new enrollment. But again, the issue you'll have there, that's going to be enrollment, we get into the fall of this calendar year and into the second quarter of our fiscal year. Does that help? Daniel Maxwell : Yes, that's helpful. And then just generally on capital allocation, anything on the attractiveness of buybacks going forward or any M&A opportunities that have become more attractive in the last few months in the pipeline? Efrain Rivera : Look, with respect to buybacks, I think we've talked about what our philosophy is in general. And at this stage, we're evaluating a range of opportunities from an M&A perspective and if the right opportunity, I'll let John talk to that, what we're looking at. But the right opportunity comes along. We obviously have the dry powder to be able to make something happen. John Gibson : Yes. I think Daniel, I think, our position has changed on this. I think the market conditions are changing and have changed and I think we're going to continually be on the lookout for opportunities that accelerate our position from an HR leader and the technology leader and continue to position us as the leading digital HR human capital management provider. So I would say some -- we've seen some valuations starting to come down. I'm sure the recent disruptions in the financial markets may create additional opportunities. And as Efrain said, we stand ready if the right opportunity comes around to pull the trigger. It's not that we haven't wanted to do something but we also are not going to overpay for something. So we're going to be -- you're going to see the same financial discipline you've continued to see from Paychex. What we believe that the market conditions are more conducive to us moving forward on the M&A front, but we'll see if that actually transpires. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jeffries. Samad Samana : Maybe one, just as I think about that comment about the number of new customers coming through strategic partnerships, how should we think about maybe how that impacts kind of customer acquisition costs those tend to be slightly larger, smaller, more profitable, less profitable? How should we think about where you're acquiring the customers from and what the impact of that is to the financials? John Gibson : So I wouldn't think anything about it. I would just really more commenting that's been Paychex for 50 years. Over 50% of our new clients have always come from strategic alliances we have. We're a respected partner with the association is been the CPAs. And so they've always been a big source of ours. It doesn't do anything to our cost of acquisition. I just think they tilted certainly during the selling season, we saw a good uptick in how they were referring Paychex over other options that they have. That was my comment. Samad Samana : Okay. Great. And then as we think about the bookings in the quarter, anything to call out between the different kind of customer sizes so think about it as very down market and maybe more micro customers versus your average customer size. Just any trends or pockets of strength or weakness? John Gibson : Well, actually, what I would say is we have good strength. I think, across the board. And actually, what I would tell you is that we actually saw a little more strength up market, not just the small start-up, 1s and 2s and on the digital side, which is during the pandemic, that's where we saw a lot of growth. We know business starts through the roof crazy levels they've subsided that they're still at high levels in comparison to pre-pandemic. So at that time, when all these start-ups were happening, also, we do a lot of managed payrolls, insure payrolls. So as you can imagine, a lot of people were hiring household staff during the pandemic. We saw a lot of escalation in the very micro end of that space. I would say that's balanced out. It's gotten back to a more balanced world and what we saw in the third quarter was strength in the more traditional segments for Paychex. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Jared Levine : It's actually Jared Levine for Bryan today. How does the 3Q PEO revenue and worksite employees come in relative to your expectations? And then what is the expectation for 4Q in terms of how worksite employees and at-risk health insurance revenue will compare to 3Q? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Jared, I won't get into that level of granularity at this point. And -- so we will report as we get through the quarter and year-end, I'm not ready to dive into specific operational metrics for the PEO at this point. We called out that revenue was going to be lower in Q4. That's a function of the topics that we've been talking about relative to insurance. But yes, I won't go any further than that. We'll have more to say as we get to Q4. Jared Levine : Okay. And then the 25 to 50 basis points of potential margin expansion for FY 24, can you discuss what the primary drivers of that expansion would be? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I mean it's a -- it's an emphasis that the Company has had. We're going through the budget process, frankly, after this call, we've done, we'll start the process of putting our budget together. But -- we just have a mantra to get more efficient where we can get more efficient. And some of it comes from operations. Some of it comes from sales. Some of it comes from G&A. It's really across the business and where we see an opportunity to become more efficient. Not simply massivley just cut costs, obviously, that's important, but also deploy technology where appropriate, to become better at doing what we're doing. We do it. I would say that many of the technologies that you read about in that here, we don't trump it, but we use. And we think that advances in things like AI can be of tremendous help to tech angle services businesses. So we're excited about the potential, to understand the risk and are actively looking at how we can deploy those technologies to get more efficient, get better at serving the clients. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : So I guess there's a school of thought out there that just one of the byproducts of the banking crisis could be some tightening of credit, small businesses find it harder to get loans. They tend to bank with a lot of the regionals, et cetera. I'm just wondering what your take is on that as we start to look into fiscal '24. It doesn't sound like you guys are really assuming a recession per se in this preliminary outlook for next year. So, I just want to get a reaction to that to start. John Gibson : Yes, Jason, I think I kind of mentioned it in my remarks and some other questions. I don't think there's any doubt. I mean, prime at 8% for small and midsize business centers and you talk to a regional bank that I've heard, and there's going to be some tightening of credit. That's part of the reason why we've seen a lot of our customers engaging us on our ERTC product. So it was interesting, I would say as we approach some of our clients, some of our clients like, I really don't need that. A lot of our clients don't -- again, we're Main Street small business owners. They're not -- they're not looking for a handout and they're probably sometimes a little gun shy to get out -- there's been a lot of talk about auditing this stuff. We had a bunch of clients that have come back to us and said, \"Hey, I can use this money. And on average, it's $180,000 per client. So we've been doing that. We created partnerships with fintechs during the PPP during the pandemic, and we're also helping our clients from that perspective as well because we've really become a trusted source for our clients to help them when they're trying to figure out how to take advantage of tax programs of government programs. When you look at the PPP loans, 9% of all of the PPP loans in the U.S. was placed by Paychex. That was more than JPMorgan and Bank of America, you guys combined. And so I think we're continuing to support them and help them, and we'll continue to look for ways that we can help them access non-traditional funding sources. And I think that's another part of our value proposition that our customers and our CPA partners are appreciating. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Understood. As a follow-up, I just wanted to ask on the float side of things, maybe a two-parter there. the first part just being, obviously, the unrealized losses have increased with the rates going up, but just wanted to confirm, you guys can comfortably meet all the float obligations just short-term component? I know you said so far to date, obviously, that's been the case. But I just wanted to make sure we shouldn't expect any material amount of realized losses? And then just any thoughts on Fed -- now coming this summer, do you see any potential impacts on float if it's adopted by enough banks? And maybe just talk about how your float income breaks down between payroll and tax pieces. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Let me take the first part. Yes, Jason, obviously, one, as John mentioned earlier in the call, when you have interest rates rising 450 basis points at the pace it did and you're holding very high-quality securities, but our interest rates at 1.5%, you're going to take going to take -- you're going to see some of the unrealized losses that you see in the portfolio. We hold our securities to maturity. So that really doesn't represent an issue. We've had swings from plus $100 million plus now obviously to this point, had nothing to do with credit. So, there's really no issues there. Understand why you ask and understand all of the all of the concerns that others had. So, those securities will roll the portfolio as they mature, just to remind people on the call, our average duration is around 3.5 years or so. So this is relatively quick. So no issues there. High quality, we really only typically in A or above and no concerns there. The second part of your question, I didn't catch. I was focusing too much on the first part, Jason. Jason Kupferberg : Yes, sorry, I was just asking about Fed now with those real-time rails coming out this summer. Just any thoughts on how that could, if it all impact float balances, float income obviously like we'll see how many banks adopt it, right, but -- and then anything just on your float income, how it breaks down between the payroll and the tax pieces? Because I know, obviously, some of the float you hold a lot longer. So... Efrain Rivera : Yes. Yes. Good question. So yes, we've been anticipating that at some point, what the current landscape of payments, certainly ACH windows, which provides some measure of the float that we have is one to narrow. But you, of course, you know business very well. A lot of our float income is not coming necessarily from overnight payroll, is coming from taxes and that should not be impacted significantly under the Fed rules. The other part that I would say flip around there is that we stopped and there's not been a lot of conversations really as much lately about real-time payments. We do think that there will be opportunities in the future and that may be an opportunity to monetize even if you lose some element of the float income. Final point, just the advertorial since this is my 12th year now, as you know, Jason, there was a point when our business was heavily depend on float 27% or so of net income. We're in a different world right now. We'll manage through it even if it doesn't materialize quite the way we expect it to. But that's the breakdown of the three pieces that I think will impact us going to in the future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Efrain, I wanted to go back to your comment on Management Solutions, payroll and pricing. Do you think it's fair to assume that considering the inflationary environment we're in and obviously, that's impacting your costs as well that the pricing on the payroll side will be higher than normal, maybe not as high as it was last year, but higher than normal? Efrain Rivera : So, I'll turn it over to for John some comments on pricing because I think that I think we need to distinguish between pure pricing and value delivered to customers. So -- but let me answer your question. So as you know, Kartik and everyone on the call knows, we typically have said that pricing is in the 2% to 4% range on a realized basis. So maybe it could be a little bit higher for some clients, but frequently or sometimes it's discounted. I don't want to talk too much to the specifics around pricing next year. I think the pricing environment will not be quite the same as it was this year. I think it was somewhat of an unusual situation given inflation. Having said that, I just want to limit that comment to the issue of pricing and not include value. I do think there's always an opportunity to think about how to add more value to a customer and then charge them for that because they're willing to accept that. I'll let John comment on some of the things that we think about in that respect. John Gibson : Yes. We certainly don't want to talk about future pricing on this call. But I think it's fair to say that we have gotten far more scientific and precise about the ability and willingness of our customer base to pay based upon a series of attributes about the way that they consume our services, the way they want to be served, and what products that we attach, we see better stickiness and price elasticity. So a lot of AI, a lot of data science, a lot of modeling for us to be very precise in that regard. And then as Efrain said, I think we try to talk a lot more about value and about how we engage them in the utilization of our products and services. We approached over -- for the first time in third quarter over 100 million mobile uses interactions with our Paychex Flex product. And a vast majority of those are employees engaging the product. And we've been doing a lot to really introduce that to not only our clients, but their employees, but now they're getting accustomed to the notification, the way Paychex, the way they can make changes in real time. And what we're seeing is people that we can do that with actually see that as a higher value. And as you can imagine, it's a higher -- it's a better customer experience, and there's also some service and margin benefit there at the same time. So that's been another lever that we understand as well that we're pushing on. So, I think what you're going to see is us continue to understand what things we need to engage the customer around that if we engage them on those items, it's going to increase the value they get from Paychex. And because of our competitive position, allow us to, I think, generate more value to the bottom line at the same time. Kartik Mehta : Fair. And then just -- we've talked a lot about, obviously, PEO and ASO. And I'm just wondering if you could give a little bit of context as to revenue per client PEO versus ASO? Efrain Rivera : Yes. I'd say, Kartik, the way to think about it is ASO does not, in general include insurances. And so, what you end up getting in a little bit of price on PEO on the base product is the added revenue that comes from benefit attachment, typically, workers' comp and also healthcare. Not all clients take health care, but when they do, then the revenue can be significantly higher. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Just a clarification on the preliminary outlook for fiscal year '24, it doesn't sound like you expect the U.S. recession in that guidance. Is that correct? And I guess if we do see a U.S. recession, how would it show up in the numbers, Efrain, because there's definitely a lag impact to where it shows up in the actual financials? Efrain Rivera : Yes. So Bryan, a good point, and obviously, we all hear the same chatter everyone is hearing. So let me just move to the answer to that. That's a little bit more new. At this point, I can only tell you what we see right now. And I can say, as we said we've repeated earlier, we see signs of moderation that we've been seeing progress since the fall after Q1, but we don't see any significant signs of slowing. So we just got through the last three months, John gave an overview of kind of what was happening from the selling season, that would have been to a signal that, hey, maybe something going on here that we needed to pay attention to and incorporate. At this point, through the selling season, we haven't seen signs of a slowdown. Again, I've seen signs of moderation and we've incorporated that in our thinking. To the extent that we saw a slowdown, obviously, we'd see it by July, and we've incorporated that in our thinking, we come back and say, guess what, things are slowing down. I don't think that things will occur that way, but it could. The way we think about the year is really -- and I've said this probably for the last three or four years, it's in two halves. So I think that are confident in terms of what we expect to see in the first half is at this stage, decent win by thesis. I mean, we've got enough trending to say something should not fall off the cliff in the first half of the year. The Fed is tight. And John said, our clients are going to be much more impacted by rate increases in the prime rate than anything else. And at this point, they seem to be absorbing where we're at and seems to be absorbing a higher rate environment. And the other thing that I would say is that our thought process is that we're getting close to peak short-term rates. So if we put that all of those factors into the gumbo and then stir it up a bit and see what our view is of first half and look at the micro factors in the business, strength in retirement services, strength in HR, we're seeing good progress on HCM and then a rebound in PEO or it produces the results we have. Now the nuance that I would provide to that is that, that takes us through, as you know, the end of November. That's the first half. We'll come up for air and see is that the trends that we expected to occur in the back half of the year actually materialized. At this point, it's a little tough to call that nine months out, but that's why we labeled with preliminary. Right now, the point out, Bryan, after I get all of those words is simply to say at this point, we don't have anything in our data that's suggesting that a slowdown is occurring or is it imminent. Now if the Fed were to decide that it needs to go back to a cycle of 50 basis points increased rates, we're going to have a different conversation really quick. Don't see that happening. And one final point. All of us on the call we're wondering two or three weeks ago when we're going to have a systemic banking prices on our hand, but we certainly were looking at that and seems like the economy was resilient enough and the Fed did I should say, treasury did the right things in terms of shoring up the banking system. So we're -- we have the environment we have. We understand what factors are moderating. We think that what this outlook incorporates is our best thinking on the environment. And I think that -- having said that, our confidence in the second half, obviously, will be something that we'll talk about -- talk more about as we go through the year. John Gibson : Yes. And I would -- yes, Bryan. I'd just point you to our Paychex IHS job index reports on our website and look at January and look at February, we released it every month. Both months, the job index improved. We didn't see that in any other consecutive months in the prior fiscal year. So certainly, we don't see as Efrain already said, and I can reiterate what Efrain said, but even the benchmarks that we would see that would be signed, we've been doing this for a while. And we have a lot of historical models of what it looks like leading into a recession. And we're just not seeing those. And what we hear from our clients in terms of the labor market, in terms of their employment, again, moderation, stabilization. They're not signing up for any big pieces. And I understand the challenge, and I try to put it in perspective is saying, how can you hear all this on the TV and the lease papers of what's happening and then rationalize that with what I walk into the office in here every day. And I do think in some respects, I said it in earlier comments and the way I've rationalized it is we -- there's two different small business worlds. And I think there's a lot of money put into a lot of tech companies, a lot of people that didn't have to make money to spend money, could pay whatever they needed to, could hire as many people even if they didn't have stuff for them to do. I think that bubble is bursting and you're seeing that being digested. I don't see the foundation of Main Street small business at this point, having those same type of dynamics that you're reading in the paper. I just simply can't put it any other way, but we're just not seeing it in the numbers. Now is there going to be a trickle down. And certainly, the banking thing last week was certain concerning because that gets contagious. Hopefully, the policymakers and individuals can do things to continue to help support Main Street small businesses from being impacted to being impacted from this kind of irrational actors that are doing things that don't make sense. But I'll get off that soapbox. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Christiansen with Citi. Peter Christiansen : Just wondering if we can get a sense for the health of the top of the funnel, if we were to exclude the ERP side of things, what are you seeing from new business formation and also perhaps some share shift from regional sell filers, that kind of stuff would be helpful color there? John Gibson : Yes. Peter, again, I'll go back. What we see is on business applications, business starts, again, they're back to pre-pandemic levels. So I was always trying to explain to people that when you look -- when I look at it because we're doing our budget points, I'm looking back almost five fiscal years now and fiscal year '19 stands out because then you see all this entity going on in the other fiscal years. Business starts are down from where they were historically. And that's why when I even look at some of our retention in the small end, that doesn't surprise me because even in good times or bad times, a small business that starts two years later, most of them aren't in business. So when I look at it, there's a good new business starts. When I looked at our sales from the third quarter, they were strong across the board, not just in ERTC but across the board. And so I really -- again, I'll go back. I'm not seeing anything on a macro level that would indicate to me that there are macro issues or there are demand issues relative to the products and services that we're offering. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Mark Marcon : A couple of questions. One is basically in terms of the margin guide or the preliminary thoughts with regards to margins for next year. To what extent would you expect to see any sort of improvement in terms of the margins ex the impact of float income? And how are you thinking about that? Efrain Rivera : Yes, it's a good question. Mark, I don't think float will play as big an impact on margin expansion as it did this year. I will hold the answer to that question. And so I've gone through the budget process because it will depend on where I end up in terms of float income for next year. We anticipate that it will grow so that will have a modest impact on the -- it will exert a positive impact on margin next year. But remember, Mark, one other thing is that we called out ERTC as moderating, that's going to exert a countervailing force. So when I pull those two together, I'll figure it out and answer on Q4. But I don't think -- I think there will be at the end of the day, likely real improvement in operating margin when all is said and done. Mark Marcon : Do you think there will or will not be? Efrain Rivera : Will, that's my expectation. But I haven't done. Mark Marcon : But ex quote, we should see some margin improvement. And then -- and then with regards to -- I know you're in the budget process now, but are you anticipating an increase in terms of the sales force and in terms of the overall headcount within the business? Or are the technological innovations that you're making sufficient to basically continue to drive the business with the same headcount? Efrain Rivera : Yes. Good question. I'll answer it in two ways and then let John give his commentary because I'm sure he will be scrutinizing every headcount in the sales budget. But the short answer is that we're where it makes sense to add headcount to drive greater sales, we are likely to do that, and I'll let John talk to that. But I think you rightly identify something that has been the feature of the Company, which is increasingly if you look at not only in the U.S. but also in Europe, where we also have a growing business, a lot of our sales are done digitally and do not require at least at a minimum the level of sales involvement that our field sales force provides. So you're going to have a mix. And I don't think that we know quite yet whether there are adds, but I would be careful I know our competitors tout their headcount adds as a precursor or a driver of growth that is not necessarily where we are at. We can grow without adding headcount, although there are places where we may use do that. I'll let John talk to that. John Gibson : Yes. I don't tell adding expense to the business very frequently. So I think that we're constantly looking to make sure that we have the right go-to-market strategies and the right go-to-market coverage. We are certainly focused on using our vast data sets and analytics and digital engagement as much as we can. As Efrain said, I went back five years ago, our digital, if you think about just in the U.S., I mean, including international paychex.com and surepayroll.com, probably a 20-point improvement in the percent -- 20 percentage point improvement. And what we're getting there. We're driving analytics to make our sales force more productive instead of just cold calling across the market or inside and client base, we're using data analytics and models and triggers of behaviors of people engaging our systems to give them active risk. So, I think there's opportunity for productivity. And we're doing a lot more digital engagement inside our applications and actually creating digital experiences to drive more attachment of ancillary products and services. So, I think when we're sitting down for the budget, we're certainly going to add sales reps engaging our strategic partners, doing things that we need to do to cover the market and the market opportunity we have, but we're equally balanced on making sure we're making the investments in digital engagement and driving productivity and using the data analytics we have to make sure we're making every rep as productive as they can be. Mark Marcon : Fantastic. And then one last one. Did you say what your -- how much pace per control ended up increasing over the course of this quarter or this year on a year-over-year basis? I've got some investors that are under the impression that your pace per control might be up by 300 bps and then they're factoring in the ERTC and looking at the underlying growth and I'm not sure that the numbers are right. So just what did you see in terms of pace per control for this last quarter? Efrain Rivera : So, we didn't talk about it, but I will say that through the year. We have seen increases in pay per control or we would say, checks, and it's moderated as we've gone through the year. So that -- in some ways, it's been a tale of two cities, the first half is port end up being different than the second half of the year. John Gibson : And Mark, just keep in mind, remember, we're Main Street small business was a year ago in terms of their ability to hire people. They were understaffed, desperate to get people. So you've got the benefit of that hiring up. It's not that there's a deceleration. It took -- this has been an interesting year in terms of people getting and that's helping them getting staffed up. Now they're staffed up. I'm not expecting that they're going to have another -- a big group of employees, regardless of whether or not there was a recession or not, right? I mean they're fully staffed. And we would expect a moderation of the growth in the number of employees in our clients. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni with Masset Makinson. Eugene Simuni : I just have one quick question to follow up on the comment on you made on Secure 2.0. always very interesting to hear about how kind of regulatory developments can help you guys. So can you elaborate a bit specifically on what the opportunities for Paychex might be from that act? And then what is the time frame for when we might see that flow into your financial results? John Gibson : Yes. Yes. So as we said, we're in our budget and we're really in our planning stages to figure out how we want to approach the SECURE Act 2.0. We started some education, certainly within our base and we're trying to figure out in scope the size of the opportunity across the market and determine what investment we're going to do that. And that's something I think we'll talk about more in the next call. We're doing a lot of surveys trying to get where people are in their understanding of what it means. There's a huge education effort that I think has to go on, but I think it's a pretty powerful value proposition. Like I said, I think the secular labor problem is going to continue. I don't -- even we get to a recession, we just simply don't have enough people working. The labor participation rate is just not big enough to meet even a lower demand were at 3.4%, 3.5% unemployment. And so, I think the simple fact is small and midsized businesses needing to compete against large employers, we typically have richer benefit plan. It's going to be a secular trend that's going to continue, and I think we're well positioned to do that. And I say that because that's going to create the opportunity for a 401(k) plan. And the SECURE Act 2.0, just to give you an idea, pretty much if you're an importer with between 20 and 50 employees, we could provide you and start up a 401(k) plan, and you would pay Paychex literally nothing because you pay us for a startup fee. You pay us for the other fees that we would have there. But you'd get all that back through tax credit. So it's -- basically, you can add the plan. And then if you want to contribute up to $1,000 to each employee, you can get that $1,000 as a tax credit as well in many circumstances. So I think there's not a lot of awareness. Look, we found the same thing with the ERTC. They're just a lot of small and midsized business owners not even where these programs exist and then they have reluctance to participate because whether we want to like it or not, they have some skepticism about government programs and being on some government list. And we're really positioning ourselves as kind of this trusted adviser to help them and help facilitate that. And so we're doing a lot of studies on it. We're trying to figure out how big the opportunity is and certainly, we think it's a great thing for small, midsize businesses. And again, I applaud the Congress and all the partisanship that goes on in Washington. It's great to see them have a program like this, and I hope there's more programs like this in the years to come to support Main Street small business owners. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Just a couple of questions from me. First and I know we've talked a little bit about this both in previous quarters, but now, but can you recap for us a little bit why you think ERTC outperformed what you thought it would do during the course of this fiscal year? And then kind of how that contributes to you thinking that it could slow a little bit in next? Efrain Rivera : I'll just start, John can take the here. Yes, Jim, I think that when we entered the year, we thought that there was widespread understanding and knowledge of the program such that as we went further and further into the base, clients would have already themselves of the service. What we actually found was that they were anxious to hear and to be educated with respect to the program and the way it works and our ability to facilitate their access to the program made them constructive about wanting to participate the level of understanding a little lower than we anticipated. John talked about that for many reasons, and it turned out that there would be a much bigger opportunity coming into this year than we had realized. As we get into next year, more and more time has elapsed the ability to access the programs is running out. One, it relates to a period of time that now will have in 18, 24 months ago. And so as we round the next year, into the beginning of calendar '24, we think that the opportunity both within our base and in general, will have moderated. So the back half of the year, we don't anticipate that there will be as much demand or opportunity. And any you want to... John Gibson : Yes. No, again, I would just reiterate, I think this is a good example of how we're trying to approach helping our clients. I think when the program was first announced, we did a lot with the PPP loan program. I talked about that 9% of all of them paired with fintech companies to be able to facilitate that. And we've really developed a muscle there to build an automated simple solution and an educational package and program for both our strategic partner CPAs and for our clients to go through. When the ERTC program came out, I think, we thought they kind of knew about it and were just trying to do general education. I think what we learned early on is that was just not resonating. And a lot of people either thought they didn't qualify or weren't sure, or quite frankly, by some of the just hassles and other challenges of participating in to some other government programs, they felt like, Hey, I don't need this right now, and I just can't tolerate. I think we had two things kind of happen. One is our data science team began to look at actual data models and we started to be able to pinpoint accuracy, be able to go to a client and say, we actually know from our data that you qualify and this is how much we're talking about. So now you're saying, hey, I can get you a check for $180,000 and what you had to do with education. There was some more information and then we made it a very simple process. So one was we were now instead of broadcasting to all of our clients, we were going with a specific database analysis to a specific client and saying, we have a high degree of confidence that you spend 10 minutes with us and we get a few pieces of information. We're going to be able to get you a check that would be meaningful and worth your time. That's one. Then we had to overcome all the obstacles, I think, simultaneously to that, interest rates started to go up, and the cost of capital started to go up. And I think a lot of small business owners who said it, hey, I don't need it. It's not worth my time. I don't want to be associated with the government program. I may get audited. And most business owners, small business owners are concerned. An audit would put them out of business worse than anything else. So they -- I think they were avoiding it. I think as we saw that happening now, the receptivity and the demand that said, hey, I really need that $180,000to bridge inflation to be able to bridge the cost of capital to grow my business. And so I think we had those two things us being more precise in terms of our messaging and getting our sales and our education teams out there. And then second, I think there were some macro pressures on small business owners that created that tailwind that exceed what we expected. James Faucette : That's really helpful color. And then just last thing for me is, Efrain, you talked about that at least initial planning stages, you think margins next year can expand some. If I reflect back on where you've talked about your margin targets in the past, we were kind of getting towards the upper end of that. Are we at a stage we can start completing that maybe the margin structure can even move above what you've talked about in the past? Or what would have to happen for that to be the case? Efrain Rivera : That's a good question, James. So -- and that's the benefit of listening to what I've said over a period of time. If you would have said to me persistently, we could be above 40%. And I would have urged caution because I didn't know whether we had all of the set of initiatives that could drive us there. The short answer to that is I don't have a great answer. I have a sense of when we're probably getting closer to the ceiling, I do think that you're right in saying that it's been reset a bit, and it's been reset a bit because of technology. So technology keeps giving us opportunities to automate things that we -- if you would have said seven years ago, is that a chatbot could be as good or better than in answering 275 questions that are 90% of what clients want to know, I would have said -- I don't know about that. And short answer now is -- that number is not 275, it's probably 375 or 400 question. So short answer is technology is going to set the limit especially in the tech services business. And so I think we probably have developed some more headroom with some of the actions that we have taken. And it's not just pure technology, but I think we wanted to become more automated efficiently. A lot of the initiatives that John started years ago have paid these dividends. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will come from Andrew Polkowitz with JPMorgan. Andrew Polkowitz : just wanted to -- just wanted to ask, you mentioned earlier that it was a fairly competitive selling season. So I just wanted to ask if you could share where that competition is coming from, whether it's new or entrance usual suspects like the regional and if there is anything to call out different from history regarding balance of trade? John Gibson : I wouldn't say any new entrants, it's the same suspects. I think what we found was just everyone was more aggressive in trying to go after and grab market share, and I'm very proud of our sales team for really outcompeting the competitive metrics were very strong for the quarter and I think in a very aggressive market. And I would say every one of our market segments all that. And I think that's going to continue. Look, I think very proud of where we are and where we're positioned. I'm sure a lot of our smaller competitors and those that are maybe a little more focused in niches that aren't doing as well as the traditional small business market is doing. We'll maybe get more aggressive, but I feel good about where our value proposition is. And I think what we're finding is, as I said, I think our strategic partners, our clients, and I think prospects are beginning to put a premium on, hey, I want to be somewhere where you know what they're doing. They're doing it right and they're stable, and they're going to be able to have the financial capability to continue to invest in their products and services over the long term. And so I think there may be a little less chasing shiny objects as we go forward. Andrew Polkowitz : Got it. And I just had one follow-up on op margins. I mean for the quarter, this quarter, it came out a little bit ahead of the 40%, 43% you laid out three months ago. Just wanted to ask if there is anything that came out better than you expected three months ago relating to the expense line? Efrain Rivera : Well, I think revenue, obviously, was a little bit higher than we expected a lot of the flow-through and drove higher margins and our expenses were in line with maybe a little bit better than we anticipated. The combination of that is really what drove better margin performance in the quarter. Operator : At this time, I have no further questions in queue. I'll turn the call back over to John Gibson for any additional or closing remarks. John Gibson : Well, thank you very much, Todd. I appreciate it. At this point, we'll close the call. If you're interested in a replay of the webcast, it will be archived for approximately 90 days on our website. I want to thank everybody for your interest in Paychex. And everybody have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this call maybe recorded. I will be standing by should need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. John Gibson, President and CEO. Please go ahead. John Gibson : Thank you, Stephanie. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex fourth quarter and fiscal year '23 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended May 31. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start with -- the call today with an update on the business highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Efrain will review our financial results for fiscal '23 and our outlook for '24. We'll then open it up for your questions. We finished fiscal year '23 with solid financial results and momentum heading into fiscal year 2024. Total revenue grew 9% for the full year and we hit a major milestone for the company with over $5 billion in total revenue. I was personally reflecting on this last night when I joined the company, we were just over $2 billion. It took us 6 years to go from $2 billion to $3 billion, 3 years to go to $3 billion to $4 billion, and it took us 3 years to go to $4 billion to $5 billion, but I remind everybody that was during the global pandemic. So certainly very proud of those results. In addition to the revenue growth at 9%, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $4.27 and operating margins finished at 41% as we continue to benefit from our continued investments in technology, our focus on driving digitalization in all aspects of our business, and our long standing tradition of operating excellence. These results are due to the hard work and dedication of our more than 16,000 employees. I'm very proud of what we've achieved this fiscal year. Our industry leading technology and advisory solutions have made a positive impact on our clients and their employees. And in return, they continue to reward us with additional business and their continued loyalty. Momentum in sales has continued with solid growth in new annualized revenue for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. HR solutions and retirement were areas of particular strength with double-digit growth. We are well-positioned in terms of our staffing levels and rep tenure heading into the new year. Revenue retention finished the year near record levels as we continue to focus on retaining and increasing our share of wallet with our high value customer segments. Client retention was impacted by higher losses due to out of business, concentrate mainly in newly formed businesses in the last 2 years and financial distress in the lower revenue small clients. We continue to see strong demand for our HR outsourcing solutions with worksite employee growth over 10% year-over-year. For the year we achieved record level worksite employee retention due to our strong and unique value proposition of our leading HR technology and advisory capabilities. Businesses of all sizes continue to navigate the challenges of a very complicated regulatory environment, a competitive labor market and now tightening credit. Demand for our solutions remains strong due to the depth and breadth of our integrated offerings, including HR technology, designed to deliver efficiency for both the employer and the employee, our comprehensive HR outsourcing which leverages the strength of our technology and the experience of a trained HR professional and our outstanding compliance organization and the need for businesses to offer quality benefits including retirement to compete for talent. Our retirement solutions are benefiting from the growing expectations of a retirement plan as a core benefit offering for small and midsize businesses. Recent passages -- passage of the SECURE Act 2.0 legislation and various state mandates requiring employers to provide retirement services to the employees or making 401(k) the key benefit for small and midsized businesses. With more state mandates expected to take effect in the future, we expect a strong market for retirement to continue for the foreseeable future, and we are well-positioned as a leader to take advantage of this opportunity. The SMB credit environment has continued to feel demand for our employee retention tax credit service. Our full service ERTC offerings has helped tens of thousands of businesses obtain tax credits, and gaining access to funds they need to keep their businesses running and growing. We continue to communicate this opportunity to existing clients and prospects. Industry recognition continues to reinforce the competitive strength of our technology solutions. For the fourth consecutive year, Paychex Flex earned an HR Tech Award for Best Small and Midsized Business focused Solutions in the Core HR category. Our consistency and winning these awards and being placed repeatedly in the leadership quadrant of respected technology analysts rankings, speaks to our market leadership in HR technology. I\u2019m not only very proud of these results in the performance of the team, but I'm also equally proud of how we achieved these results. We have been consistently recognized as one of the world's most admired, most ethical and most innovative companies. In addition, we've been ranked as one of the best place -- places to work for people in sales, for women, for diversity, and for our outstanding training and investment in our employees development. These awards are a testament to how our employees not only get the job done, but do it the right way and we are constantly looking for new ways we can make ourselves and our communities better. As we move into fiscal year '24, we will continue our focus on developing leading customer experiences that combine our technology, our advisory capabilities and our partnerships to deliver superior value to our customers. Paychex is uniquely positioned to help small and midsize businesses navigate the challenges they face in a complex and ever changing and evolving world. We remain committed to our purpose, and that is to help businesses succeed. And we'll continually strive to have a positive impact on our clients, our employees, our communities and our shareholders. Now I'll turn it over to Efrain, who will take you through our financial results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year as well as our guidance for fiscal year '24. Efrain? Efrain Rivera : Thanks, John, and good morning to all of you. I hope you're indoors on this smoky Thursday. I thought we're past it, but like not quite. I would like to remind everyone that today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements referred to the customary disclosures that we make. I'm going to start by providing a summary of our fourth quarter financial results, talk about full year results and then finish with a review of our fiscal 2024 outlook. Just before I start, I also wanted to add that the joining us in the room today, this morning is Bob Schrader, VP of Finance and IR. Many of you have met Bob. Okay, for the fourth quarter, you saw total revenue increased 7% to $1.2 billion. Management solutions revenue was up [indiscernible], a little bit over 909 driven by additional product penetration. HR ancillary services, which currently mostly ERTC and also price realization. We continue to see strong attachment of our HR solutions, retirement and time and attendance products. Demand for our ERTC service remains strong as John mentioned, and it contributed approximately 1% to 2% to total revenue growth for the full year. Demand for this service along with our internal execution that continues to exceed our expectations, while ERTC has been a tailwind and we expect demand to continue into fiscal year '24. It will become a moderate headwind next year, especially in the back half of the year where it will become more of a headwind. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 5% to $300 million driven by higher revenue per client and growth in average worksite employees. The rate of growth was tempered a bit by lower medical plan sales and participant volumes along with continued preference for ASO in this environment. We expect these trends will start to normalize as we progress through fiscal 2024, though it won't be evident, necessarily in Q1. I'll talk about that in a little bit. Interest on funds held for clients increased 69% to $25 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates partially offset by realized losses taken in Q4 as we reposition the portfolio heading into the back half of this year. Total expenses increased 3% of $776 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher headcount, wage rates and general costs to support growth in the business. Operating income increased 15% to $453 million with an operating margin of just under 37%, a 240 basis point expansion over the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share increased 18% to $0.97 per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20% for the quarter to again $0.97 per share. Let me quickly summarize our full year results. Total revenue increased 9% to $5 billion and total service revenue increased 8% to $4.9 billion as you are all aware we raised guidance a number of times during the year. Management solutions increased 8% to $3.7 billion; PEO and insurance increased 6% to $1.2 billion. Total expenses were up 7% to $3 billion. Operating income increased 10% with a margin of 40.6%. John mentioned this earlier, at the 70 basis point expansion over the prior year. The leverage in the model was pretty evident. Other income, net increased by over $30 million due to higher average interest rates and average investment balances within the corporate investment portfolio. Diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $4.30 per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13% for $4.27 per share. Our financial position remains rock solid, with cash restricted cash and total corporate investments of more than $1.6 billion and total borrowings of approximately $808 million as of May 2023. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion for the fiscal year, an increase of 13% from the prior year, driven by higher net income and changes in working capital. Free cash flow generated for the year was $1.5 billion or 50% year-over-year. And while it's easy to gloss [ph] over those numbers, I think it's really important that when we -- to note that when we report numbers, the quality of our earnings and our quality of our cash is very, very strong as noted by some of you. Not only do we deliver on the top line, but we deliver in a quality way for them on the bottom line, and we intend to continue to do that. We paid out a total of $1.2 billion in dividends during fiscal 2023 or 70% of our net income, 12 month rolling return on equity with the stellar 48% with an arrow pointing up. Now, let me turn to guidance for the upcoming fiscal year ending May 2024. Our current outlook as you saw is as follows. Management Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 5% to 6%. PEO and Insurance Solutions expected to grow in the range of 6% to 9%, the [indiscernible] net of debt just to accommodate the fact that sometimes attachment on insurance can vary from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year as we saw last year. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $135 million to $145 million. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 7%. Operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%. Other income, net is expected to be income in the range of $30 million to $35 million, and then our effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share expected to grow in the range of 9% to 10%. This outlook assume current macroeconomic environment, which as you know, has some uncertainty surrounding future interest rate changes in the economy, We have better visibility in the first half of fiscal 2024. As each quarter progresses, we have a little better visibility into the remaining quarters in the year. For the first half of fiscal 2024 and the first quarter, we expect total revenue growth to be approximately 6%. That's the first half and first quarter. We anticipate operating margins for the first quarter to be approximately 41% will help do a little bit on your modeling. And we expect PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue to be below the low end of the range for the first quarter, then it'll be solidly in the range. That's our expectation at this point. Before you ask me the question, I will answer the first quarter was actually the strongest quarter of the year on PEO last year. And as a consequence the compare will be a little bit tougher than we expect, the business build as we go through the year. Of course, all of this is subject to our current assumptions and they can change. We'll update you again on the first quarter call. There's a number of questions because it's of course, the time when we give guidance. So if I could just ask for your forbearance on something which is to say, ask a question and limit yourself to one follow-up. Now, I will say I understand some of those questions will be compound questions, but it's a five part compound question that violated the rules. So -- but just so we can get through the call without going excessively long. With all of that, I refer you to our investor slides on our website for additional information. And I'll turn the call back over to John. John Gibson : Okay. Now with all the conditions and restrictions that Efrain has laid out for you, we will now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question this morning. Can you comment on the pricing environment? You called it out a little bit in the press release. And I guess the question is, are you seeing sort of a window right now for more aggressive pricing adjustments just given the inflationary environment? Or is this sort of -- are you feeling now that you're in sort of a steady state, kind of continual trajectory when it comes to pricing? John Gibson : Yes, Ramsey, thanks for the question. Yes, I would say we're more in a steady state. I feel good about where we are. I think the value of our products and services, I think what we see, when we talk about price inside our customer base, they're rewarding us, they're seeing the value we're getting. And as we did last year, we believe we have a pricing of power inside the base and we'll continue to avail ourselves of that. And then in terms in new clients and prospects in the competitive environment, hey, we've always been in a competitive market, and I see stable pricing. And I think as we go through this year, we'll continue to do what we need to do to be competitive in the marketplace. So I don't see any major shifts of change on either side of the pricing equation. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. And I wanted to ask also about retention. Obviously, retentions at healthy record levels. At the same time, you called out a little bit of where you were seeing a little bit of headwind, I think it was from out of business, from newly formed businesses, and I think there was some other color that Efrain provided. If you could just elaborate on that a little bit, I'd appreciate it. John Gibson : Yes, Ramsey, I think we've been pretty consistent. And I think on all the prior calls I've said, probably as we expected. So we continue to really focus our efforts on the high-end part of our valuable clients, particularly in HR outsourcing there. We continue to maintain both in the PEO and ASO, record retention from a revenue and client perspective there. Where we did see and we have near record retention overall across the business, again, because of that focus that we're having the things we're doing from driving value in our high value customer segments. As we expected, we did see some other business and when I pull that back, what you're seeing is exactly what I thought we'd see we had a very high number of new business starts 2 years ago. And almost every model, and I don't care whether we're in a recession, good times, or bad times, a business starts in the first 2 years, half of them are gone. And so I'm not surprised when we're saying we kind of expected that to be the case and that's what we saw on kind of the client retention side. But again, even if you look at the client retention side, we're back to where we were pre-pandemic levels. So nothing dramatic there. So I'd say that's more stabilizing and we kind of expect that kind of more typical stable kind of client attrition to occur as we're going into '24. Ramsey El-Assal: Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Eric Dray : Hi. This is Eric Dray on for Jason. Thanks for taking the question. I had a question just kind of high-level. We've seen small businesses be really resilient kind of seems like the macro may avoid a hard landing. But curious about kind of trends you're seeing among different client groups. Anything to call out maybe blue collar versus white collar, any color you can add there? John Gibson : Yes. Look, I think, again, not seeing anything, Eric, that's out of the norm. I think generally, we've continued to see the hospitality when you go back and look at our jobs index. Hospitality has probably been the laggard. Leisure and hospitality have been the laggard through the course of the recession. What we've seen there is they really made a good strong comeback, I would say in the back half of this fiscal year for us and are getting back to what I've kind of level -- employment levels of the other segments. Not really seeing anything, specifically out of the ordinary. Certainly in the low end of the market, you're seeing a lot more of the small companies get back to what we said on the retention side. We were startups, smaller company, finding more pressure relative to inability to pass price, instead of being [indiscernible] by inflation, and then also the credit, the credit situation. Eric Dray : Okay, great. Thanks. And then on the -- this one is for Efrain. On the float guidance, kind of two parts. What are you thinking about burn interest rates? And then, what are your thoughts on kind of managing duration. I know the question comes up every call, but thought I'd ask. Thanks. Efrain Rivera : What we're thinking, and then how we're managing, I will break those two. I mentioned in previous calls that I was really concerned about a sharp decline in rates in the first half '24 and the end of this year, calendar year. I don't think that's likely to happen. So at this point, our thinking is that there'll be a couple of rate increases, as we go through the first half of the year, and likely to see some rate decreases as we enter next year. Certainly Jerome Powell's comments recently would seem to indicate that's where we're growing. But I think -- we think our assumption is that in the first half of calendar year '24, our second half, you're going to see rate decreases. So net-net, that's what's incorporated in our guidance. So while we could adjust and play games in terms of where we are with futures, that that's what our thinking is. And as we get through the year in the back half of the year, we'll update kind of where we're at. So as to position in the portfolio, my bias is to go along, as we go through the year to mitigate what in '24 is likely to be a set of rate decreases. I can't call it any closer than that. I think that our numbers kind of support that kind of scenario. John Gibson : Stephanie? Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Rayna Kumar with UBS. Rayna Kumar : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about what booking was? John Gibson : Hi, Rayna. Rayna Kumar : Hello. Can you talk a little bit about bookings in the quarter, anything that call out on different customer sizes and products where you're seeing strengths or weaknesses? John Gibson : Yes. So, look, we actually saw strong demand continuing. I would say, actually, the -- we actually saw some acceleration in the fourth quarter when you look at it. And the back half of the fiscal year was actually stronger than the first half, which it was a pleasant thing. HR services, or HR solutions continue to resonate retirement. We saw a pickup in the rolling digital end of our business in the fourth quarter, which was nice to see. And in fact, I would say the PEO had improvement in Q4 as well, which was an encouraging sign that some of the changes and approach that we've been working on are beginning to get traction. It's early they're and the key part of that season is in the first quarter, which leads into the second quarter. But again, very pleased with the strong demand that we saw across the platforms. I think we got a good set of products and services through strong demand in this environment across all the market segments. Rayna Kumar : That is very helpful. And then just a quick, really quick follow-up to stay within Efrain's guidelines here. Can you call up the ERTC contribution just for the fourth quarter? Efrain Rivera : No, we didn't. We think we're going to stick with -- it's 1% to 2% on growth for the full year or so. And then that convert from a tailwind into a headwind next year, that's as far as we go. Rayna Kumar : Got it. Okay. Thank you. John Gibson : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was going to ask first on kind of M&A within Paychex. If you could just kind of give us an update on your ambitions both in the near-term and medium-term. This is definitely a compound question. But preference between HCM and PEO and anything you could say on valuations? John Gibson : Yes, Andrew, thanks for the question. Our ambitions remain the same. We're trying to find opportunities to meet our strategic objectives and at the same time, make sense financially. The latter has been more challenging in the environment, I'd say over the past few years. But I think we certainly began to see some change in the market dynamics and our pipeline is beginning to expand with opportunities that I think are more realistic for us to consider. I don't think our focus has really changed. We're going to continue to look for tuck-ins. That help us kind of add scale in the markets or expand our product suite. We are looking for capability enhancements, particularly in the digital areas, digital capabilities, data, data analytics, HR, HR analytics. And then again, we're constantly looking at numerous adjacencies as the market continues to evolve, and looking for new growth platforms that are adjacent to our current suite of solutions and really help us continue to deliver that, that value proposition with small, medium sized businesses to help them succeed. So again, smart tuck-ins, capability enhancements in the growth platforms. That's our areas of focus. And we're going to continue to be mindful of making sure we're getting good deals [indiscernible]. Andrew Nicholas : That's helpful. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, I just wanted to ask on kind of the margin guide for next year. I think last quarter you spoke to a preliminary target of 25 to 50 basis points. I think, the 41% to 42% range you put out this morning is a decent bit higher at the midpoint. So if you could just kind of unpack that a little bit what -- what's changed in terms of your outlook, if anything? Or if it's just a matter of rounded numbers? And that's totally fine as well, just trying to get a little bit more insight there. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Yes, I guess I'd answer that in a couple of ways. Look, March is preliminary, mean that we haven't gone through a plan. I think that John's continued a tradition that that we've had in the company, which is to say, where we can find sources of leverage in the P&L. So obviously, mix has an impact on that, Andrew, as you're aware. As you get more opportunity and more management solutions, that gives you more opportunity. But I would say we went through pretty disciplined process in the planning process to see where there were opportunities to leverage uncover them. And that that's what you're seeing in the guidance. I'd say one other thing that's really important. The process of planning a year is a 365 days activity. If we get through the first quarter, because we see opportunities both on the investment side, and also on the cost side, we go for it. And we challenge ourselves to find those opportunities. So I think that in addition to the fact that that was a byproduct [indiscernible] byproduct, but a theme of the planning process. We think in those terms, and so because you'd have to go into the year with multiple levers to find leverage if you need it. So we're, as we speak, thinking about okay, how can we even do better or offset any potential issues that might come up in the year. So it means that there's a little bit around -- a little bit of planning and a little bit of DNA. Andrew Nicholas : Perfect. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thanks. John Gibson : Hey, Kevin. Kevin McVeigh : I'll just have one to make up some time. Hey, Efrain -- hey, pardon me, you talked a little bit about I think, kind of revenue retention versus client retention and revenue retention being an all-time high despite kind of, I think, a little shift in client. Can you help us frame what the delta is there kind of what it is today, and kind of where that's been historically, and I would imagined, probably narrowed over time. But is there any way to frame that a little bit more? Efrain Rivera : Yes, yes. So, look when it was approaching the mid 80s during the pandemic, but that really is in some ways kind of an outlier. When we reported last year, it's kind of like 1 year post the midpoint of the pandemic, sorry, the midpoint of the pandemic, we were between 83 and 84 and this year we are between 82 and 83. So as John mentioned, we saw some larger losses on the low end of the market. I will frame that in one second. That 82, 83 is consistent with where we've been in prior years, there's nothing unusual about that. What was unusual during the pandemic was that the number of bankruptcies or what we call involuntary losses was much lower than it normally has been. And there's obvious reasons, I don't need to tell everyone on the call about PPT. So a lot of those clients kind of got through the client base to John's point. What was going on was that you had a pent up [ph] group of very small clients, that were being propped up a bit by funding in some way the losses were higher because of that. And I think we're now back to a more normalized environment in terms of losses. But I want to make an important point and John referenced it. We put a lot of emphasis on revenue retention, especially among high value clients and what's not different or what is different from pandemic is that our revenue retention is higher than it was pre-pandemic. So we're at record retention levels from revenue, that's where we put our -- that's where we put a lot of our focus on, and I can -- I won't do it, but we could cite many, many efforts that go into retaining our highest clients. So we can deliver approximately 88% revenue retention, that's important. That's an important number for us. And so while in the past, we talk a lot about unit retention, nothing wrong with that, you want that. The reality is that was becoming -- become much more important that you save, and you retain your highest valued clients. And so while on -- while our unit retention is in line with what it was pre-pandemic, our revenue retention was higher, and it has remained higher and will be an area of focus going forward. John Gibson : Yes, Kevin, the thing I would add to that, I will remind everybody I go back and -- we go back and look at this over the last 4 to 5 years, when we say pre-pandemic levels, you go back to '19, you got our transcript, what you would also hear in '19 is that on a client retention, we were aligned, we actually had historical high client retention back in '19 as well. So we're returning on the client side to levels that historically, for Paychex would have been historical highs into client retention and then as Efrain pointed out, we've had a lot of focus on what we need to do to drive better retention in our high value segments and we've been very successful to do that. And I think coming out of the pandemic, the value that we've demonstrated to those clients in terms of both our technology enhancements as well as the advisory support that we've given them through very challenging times, I think they rewarded us -- they rewarded by buying more from us. They rewarded us by giving us the opportunity to have a better pricing for those products and services because they see the value and they reward this with the loyalty. Kevin McVeigh : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Bryan Bergin : Hey guys, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to dig into management solutions here a bit more and maybe some of the underlying growth driver assumptions for '24. When we look here, this year, in '23, I see total company client growth of like a .5 in '23. And you're citing increased product penetration, price realization. Can you kind of roll that forward for us here? Can you give us a sense on how you're thinking about the pieces here across the client growth versus pricing versus product with that? Efrain Rivera : Yes, yes, I would say, Bryan, two things is that we have said that typical client growth in the year is going to be in the 1% to 3% range. We're on the low end of that range, we expect to be middle or higher next year. So that's part of the equation on the pricing side. We're typically in the 2% to 4% range, although on recent years higher than that. We\u2019re on the mid to maybe perhaps a little bit higher than mid-level on the pricing on site. Those are sort of the basic elements, and then you got mix and additional product penetration driving the remainder of that. Now if you start reconciling me, I got to take the negatives too. And the negative is, I'm going to get some headwinds from ERTC, which you will see in -- on the management solution side. So that when you triangulate all those pieces, that's where you get to our 5% to 6% growth. Bryan Bergin : Okay. How about client employment there? So and I got specifically in 4Q you had [multiple speakers] 3Q and then for '24 as well. Efrain Rivera : Sorry, I started talking over [indiscernible]. You were saying 3Q and Q4, what were you saying then? Bryan Bergin : Yes. So when -- as you think about client employment, curious about how you're factoring that for '24. But also, I think you guys were assuming 4Q was going to be relatively flattish from 3Q. Did that play out or was that different too? Efrain Rivera : Yes, yes, that played out and going into next year, we expect to be flattish. I will say that, I mean, you always have to have an element of caution on the impact of higher rates. I mean, they share the level of their -- that would cause me to get a little bit [indiscernible] concern that I have right now. So we'll have to play that out. And that definitely would have an impact on worksite employee growth. I think it's manageable and we've taken that into account in our plan. But at this point, we're not expecting that is going to change [indiscernible] sure. Bryan Bergin : Okay, makes sense. Thank you very much. Efrain Rivera : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Hi, guys. Good morning. Hi, how you doing? Efrain Rivera : Good morning. Go ahead. Bryan Keane : I just want to -- yes, I just wanted to follow-up on the client growth question. It sounds like you expect it to go up a little bit, higher than it was on the low end of the range, and then it will go up. Is that a function of what you're seeing in the sales channel or is that a little bit of retention just given that maybe some of the smaller clients that turned off during the pandemic, you won't have that same issue as you go into this year? Efrain Rivera : Yes, Brian, to answer that, as John mentioned, that's generally the level of detail. But we saw a pretty strong unit growth as we -- in the back half of the year. So it wasn't a sales driven issue, it's really more of a retention driven issue based on the factors that we talked about earlier in the call. I -- just to go one level deeper, we all remember that one of the anomalies in the pandemic was that the business starts really, really accelerated. And I think to this day [indiscernible] could completely explain it. And so we benefited from that, that unit growth but as John said, we know a number of those clients are going to go out of business. And after 2 years, we did the analysis that we all looked at, and a lot of those clients did not survive once the PTP [ph] and other government stimulus went out of business -- I'm sorry, once that stimulus was gone. So at that primarily driver, somewhat of a normal situation, I think that will, return to more traditional patterns as we get into next year. That's our expectation. Bryan Keane : Got it. And the guidance looks pretty consistent. As you look at the revenue and the margins, you're not wildly off from the first half, the second half and sometimes there's bigger changes there. Any kind of key macro factors that you watch that we should be watching that could move it up or down, that could change at least maybe as we get into the second half as we think about the macro? Efrain Rivera : Yes, I'll let John talk about it too, but what I'd say, Bryan, is look, everyone on the call was worried about a crash landing [indiscernible] '23. And, look, I mean, there was skepticism in the market as to whether we're going to be able to hit our numbers. [Indiscernible] conversations with investors and I assured them with one thing that continues to be the factor that are the environment that we're seeing now, which we're not seeing dramatic changes in the environment, and we would start to see them and exercise the appropriate level of caution as we did. So we're going to look at what's the impact of these interest rates at this point. Small businesses seem to be absorbing them. They seem to be getting what they need to be able to fund their businesses, we don't think that will last forever. Their rates at which it's going to prove to be difficult, I would say what's happening on the macro is really important. The internal stuff, we can manage that, we will manage that. And I\u2019ve said to many people that, look, we have to pivot inside the base, there's a lot opportunity inside the base, we'll pivot inside the base if the external environment doesn't give opportunities for growth. John, do you want to add anything? John Gibson : Yes. No, I think the other thing that, I think to keep in mind a little bit about the macro, again, we'll get back to the macro side, I look at our small business index, I look at the start of this calendar year, we went the first 3 months, the index actually went up every month. So went up for three consecutive months, and then it sort of stabilized. So we continue to see that. As Efrain said, we probably expected in the fourth quarter, and we're always kind of sitting there waiting for employment to go down and [indiscernible]. So actually, I would say I was actually a little pleasantly surprised at where we were on checks and where we were on worksite employee growth inside the base of clients that we had. So continuing to see that hiring is also an issue. And staffing, it continues to be an issue of our HR concern. So we look at what are the questions and issues that are coming in to our HR consultants, we continue to see that to be an issue. And I do think you're going to see something [indiscernible] we probably not seeing. Small midsize business owners are scarred by their experience of employment over the last several years and they fought to get back to staffing levels. I think what's going to be interesting is they're going to be very hesitant to let go, because I think they remember what it was like trying to find talent and just simply not enough labor supply here. So I think it's going to be very interesting, who kind of wins this tug of war, back and forth relative to employment. The other thing that we see is we're seeing a lot of nontraditional labor being tapped by a business as gig workers, contract workers, maybe a little bit more part time. And what I -- what I'm curious about to see are will those be the first things to go. With that [indiscernible] a small business owner is going to let go permanent staffing that they've got, that they're paying every week, are they going to try to write it out by tightening in other areas such as this nontraditional gig employment that's kind of sprung up. So the labor market is a very, very interesting thing I think for us to look at and study right now. And I don't think it sets up for traditional recessionary models that people have built. So that's just my pontification based upon my conversations with what we're hearing from clients and what we see in our data. Bryan Keane : Super helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Scott Wurtzel : Hey, good morning, guys and thanks for taking my questions. Just on the expense side, wanted to see if you guys can just go over maybe what some of your top investment priorities are over the next 12 months and sort of folding into that, how you're thinking about maybe incorporating generative AI into your business as well. John Gibson : Yes, so the investments are in growth and growth those are probably the top two. And then you mentioned digital, I mean, we've been making a lot of investments in the digital area, both in terms of our sales and what we're doing from a go-to-market perspective, which we're very happy with and how we're leveraging technology AI in the back office. And I'm very pleased with several things that we've got going on. So we've been actively leveraging AI for several years across every area of the business, driving efficiency, delivering a lot of our large clients. And one of the things I keep telling people was, we're one of the few players in this industry to have the size of data set that we have. And I do think in these types of AI, you've got to have a large data set. We're using it in customer service, we're using it in risk, we're using it in finance, we're using it in our HR outsourcing advisory capacity, we're building it into our products, and our retention insights products. So there's a lot of investment that we're making and a lot of learnings that we have in terms of how we can digitize the front office and the front of house and kind of the back office of our business. And so those are -- that's going to be an area that we continue to invest and continue to explore. Scott Wurtzel : Got it. It's very helpful. And then Efrain just a quick clarification on the [indiscernible] income side with the guidance. I'm wondering if you could maybe help us out with how you're thinking about client balanced growth for the year? John Gibson : Client balanced growth, roughly in line with wage inflation, which is to say low single-digit. Scott Wurtzel : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Hey, good morning. Efrain Rivera : Hey, Kartik. Are you battling with smoke there in Cleveland too? Kartik Mehta : Yesterday was a lot worse than it is today. So it's a little bit better today. But thank you for asking, Efrain. John Gibson : You [indiscernible] Kartik. Kartik Mehta : Will do so. I'm wondering, just on [indiscernible] control, Efrain I know they've come down obviously from pretty high levels. And I'm wondering if what your expectations are for FY '24, not only for the payroll business, but also the PEO and if you're seeing anything different? Efrain Rivera : Yes, two good questions. So flattish, I guess is the short answer to what we expect for '24. Don't expect too much in terms of inclined base growth and that's a mix. I think our larger clients are doing fine. And in some cases, adding employees, we look at it. Smaller clients less so and then you got to factor in what your anticipated losses are. So you always tend to lose a little bit higher than what you gain in a given year. And then you expect your incline, your decline from the base to grow the worksite employees. But this is an environment where I don't think it's going to be robust in terms of hiring, in part because of what John said earlier, which is that that many businesses would like to hire that just simply aren't the people who were there -- were available and also figured out how to do it without people, but probably won't be, as John mentioned, less inclined to perhaps get rid of them. On the PEO, and I'd say also the ASO side, our worksite employee, we have worksite employee growth this year. We expect that to continue into next year. You could see solid works and [indiscernible] growth as the key or rebound going into next year. But overall, and I think that Bryan asked this question, it's not going to be a significant driver of revenue growth, perhaps in PEO, but not on the HCM side. Kartik Mehta : And then just one follow-up. John, I'd be interested in your thoughts on kind of job openings. We see all these numbers jolts numbers, but seems like employee -- employers have become cautious. So just your perspective on what you really think job openings are as you look at your customers versus maybe what we see in the news. John Gibson : Yes, I go back to what I said before, we continue to have clients that are wanting to fill open positions. And I don't -- I have not seen that change. I would say that they're being more successful in filling and filling those positions. So we've certainly seen that and we've seen some recovery. I mentioned, leisure and hospitality, in particular, which was well behind and had good recovery in the back half of our fiscal year here. I do think relative to [indiscernible] maybe opening up as many positions, I would also tell you that one of the things that I think did happen is when we were in the great resignation, which was probably a few months ago, seems like forever now, but really only 18 months ago, pretty much a lot of business owners were thinking every position I have needs to be posted, because I've got to assume that I'm going to potentially lose those positions. So I think there was a lot of postings for jobs that people were passively looking for. And I think some of the contraction that we've seen in the postings are more of business owners being a little more disciplined about what am I actually going to hire and being out in the market and focus on that. I don't know if that makes sense or helps you. Kartik Mehta : It does. Thank you both. I Really appreciate it. John Gibson : Yes, you\u2019re welcome. John Gibson : I may add that those individuals that are using our onboarding and recruiting experience inflexed are realizing about a 20% improvement in their time to hire. So just if there's any customers or prospects on the phone. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Eugene Simuni with Masset Makinson. Eugene Simuni : Thank you. Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question about the PEO. So, we expected the kind of the deceleration here. And you highlighted again, insurance, health care insurance attach rates is one of the drivers. So I was wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on that kind of where are you seeing softness in health care insurance attach? What kind of businesses I think that'll be helpful to hear just because there's so much variability about around I feel like the PEO industry in terms of this health care insurance rate attached? And it would be helpful to hear specifically in your client base, what you're seeing. And then related to that, as we are looking for the reacceleration in the PEO and as you kind of guiding to that, what gives you confidence that this -- there will be pivot there over the next 12 months? Efrain Rivera : Hey, Eugene. Let me start and John will provide additional comments. With us, it's less about verticals, although I'll caveat that in a second. It's really more about where we derive revenue on the health care side that flows through the P&L. And that's in state of Florida. So for us on the PEO health care, as it relates to revenue, really, it's a Florida game primarily, and the anomaly and when you talk about Florida, you know immediately that you're going to over index [indiscernible] hospitality. So a bit of what's going on is it depends on new clients coming into the base and whether customers in leisure and hospitality are really interested in offering health care to clients. [Indiscernible] and that's not all clients in Florida to be fair, that's probably too much of a generalization. But it was more of a regional issue than it was I would say, as an effected revenue than it was something else. So why do we feel more comfortable? Because we have put a tremendous amount of focus on it. And that's not to say that guarantee success. But I would say as we saw what was going on, we took a lot of measures to improve that that aren't going to necessarily again be evident in first quarter but should be evident beyond that. And there were things in which we talked about in prior calls, I won't repeat that. We are somewhat anomalous that we saw people actually in the PEO decided they didn't want health care insurance. We thought our hypothesis was they were feeling some pressure from a wage perspective and perhaps decided that from a total compensation perspective, they were not going to offer health care. But we've taken a number of actions that we think will create better momentum going next year. I'll let John talk about that issue. John Gibson : Yes. Not much to add, Eugene. I do think it's important to understand on the insurance component there was a trend that we saw happen not just in the field, but also in our insurance agency. In the health and benefits area, which it's not just the client, there's two decision points here. One is the client deciding they're going to offer benefits. And second is an employee deciding they're going to enroll and pay their fair share. And we saw in both cases that clients, particularly clients, [indiscernible] clients were adding an insurance, that's one part of it, right. You should certainly can go and try to get someone to switch from their existing insurance [indiscernible], we saw less people adding insurance -- health insurance as an option. And then when you look inside, when we went through our normal enrollment period, we found that less of the employees that were offered insurance elected to sign up for it. And so all the things Efrain just said, we saw that happening -- happened in both areas that caused us to go back. And what you can do is you can go back and look at your plan designs, you can look at [indiscernible] plans, you can look at different plans, all of those things. We went through an exhaustive review of every one of our core peer markets to look at every one of our plan designs and look at every one of our offerings to make sure we have the broadest suite. Now those decisions are made. We're actively out in the market, selling clients on those today, those will go in the July timeframe, if you will. And remember, our enrollment for PEO begins in that July timeframe, it really goes through the January timeframe. So you want to kind of that picked up of that going on. So we've looked at every aspect of it. We've made some modifications and changes where we think it makes sense. We know that the HR outsourcing value proposition is still strong because it's growing at 10%. And we saw strong demand in the second half of the year. We know that the PEO value proposition is strong because of our record retention and the clients that can afford it and have it are doing well. So we have [indiscernible] some early signs, as I said earlier in the fourth quarter of improvement there. And now we're getting into the heart of it and we'll see that that kind of builds as we go into the second, third and fourth quarter of this coming fiscal year. So, again, we got -- we feel confident that we have the right plans in place. And now we'll go out and execute that in the marketplace and see how it goes. Eugene Simuni : Got it. Super helpful. And then quick follow-up on some of the comments you made earlier on retention bookings, and client growth tied altogether. So when we're thinking about your guidance for next fiscal year, and Efrain you mentioned that you expect client growth to pick up from the kind of 1.5% level with so this year. Would that be a result of both improved retention and improved sales? Or is it primarily one or the other that will drive improvement in client growth? Efrain Rivera : No, you got to do both. I mean, over relying on one -- long story short, both sides of that equation pretty powerful incentives to make sure that they occur. You don't always hit it a 100%. Sometimes you hit it more, but you got to get both sides -- to both sides to work to get the right net client gaining number. John Gibson : Yes, And I'll add on to that. Again, I would say the second half was stronger than the first half from a sales unit perspective. And if you dig under our retention numbers first half to second half, our controllable losses improved in the second half. So, again, what we can control and I do believe that there's a degree of what I call flushing out of the bankruptcies from 2 years ago in terms of us looking at clients that are kind of on the financial edge, and whether or not we want to continue to or feel confident we can continue to do business with them, those type of things are kind of flushed out of the system. We've been investing a lot in what we can do to control, what we can control, regardless of the environment. It talks about AI. We've been deploying a lot of very sophisticated AI models inside our service organization, and inside our client base that are giving us very strong indications of where we may have a client at risk. And we're demonstrating success and demonstrate success in the back half of the year of being able to intercept those and turn those situations in the positive retention story. So, when I look at the retention story and the sales story, first half back half of last fiscal year, I feel good about the progress we're making there. Eugene Simuni : Got it. Thank you very much. Efrain Rivera : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Peter Christiansen with Citigroup. Peter Christiansen : Thank you. Good morning. John Gibson : Thanks for your question. How are you doing? Peter Christiansen : Good. Efrain, I was curious about the portfolio repositioning and not [indiscernible] large, but should we expect I guess future maybe operating outperformance to be reinvested for portfolio repositioning, maybe layering to rates faster. And then as a follow-up to that may be looking at prior cycles, is there a relationship between interest rates and competitive pricing? I would imagine this float income becomes more a bigger part of the business model that gives more leeway for competitors to be more aggressive on the pricing side. Any comment there would be helpful. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Those are two absolutely fantastic questions, literally. I mean, wow. Okay. So let me take one. Part of what you do, part of what you work with the team is to understand what you need to deliver and understand what your degrees of freedom in delivering them are. When you perform at a certain level, you have more degrees of freedom, not surprising. So it's all my colleague CFOs out there who struggle sometimes because they don't have the degrees of freedom, I feel it. When you do have the opportunity to reposition because performance gives you that option to look at it and figure out, we're pretty disciplined here is the NPV of doing that better than the NPV of not doing that. And so, in the fourth quarter, we thought there was a positive NPV to that approach. When we do it in the future, I would have to see there's other [indiscernible] issues that come into play, which is how much -- what do you want your max duration to be, and are you picking the right time. You never get it right, because you're trying to predict other behaviors. But I think that we've done a good job. To your point, this is really kind of the interesting question that we're wrestling with is, so we don't know -- I can give you a sense of what happens when interest rates get to 6%. I know because I studied that pretty extensively when I came into the job now 12 years ago. And two things you got to worry about or be concerned about there. Number one is that you can attempt to be pretty aggressive on pricing in that kind of environment. So if interest rates are high, you can take it as a signal the price high. But what I find at least in our history was when you did that, and when you get that overly aggressive in pricing in '07, '08, you're going to pay a price on retention, it just it follows. And at least that's the conviction that I have. Now maybe you leave some money on the table by not pricing even more aggressively, but I think that there's a balancing act that -- there for clients, because you're trying to create a level of trust in terms of the value that you've delivered to them and there is a tipping point at which that level of trust gets breached. So we need to look at that closely. The second part is, as interest rates are now creeping up, if they were to go over 6% now that starts to becoming a threshold where it becomes more difficult for small businesses and many medium sized businesses to operate from a financing perspective. They got to look for other options. That's one thing by the way that we look -- we're looking at very closely, how do we help clients. ERTC was a great example of how we did that this year. That's why we think it did so well within the base. But you got to play those two elements off each other in determining what the price and how to help the clients navigate to an environment where interest rates are high. So hopefully that answers your question. Peter Christiansen : Yes, certainly it does, the balance. That's certainly a challenge. I would imagine, I don't envy you. But thanks for the insight. Very helpful. Efrain Rivera : Yes. You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, John, Efrain. Just want to ask on PEO. Again, I know it was growing in line with peers in the quarter here, are you looking for some acceleration? You talked through that with Eugene. How much of the acceleration again, just to simplify is coming from volume versus rate versus mix, just want to make sure I understand the components? Efrain Rivera : Well, I will take that Tien-Tsin. So, look, I want to kind of clarify something to start, which is that we have worksite employee growth in the PEO. It's not as though we contracted in that area. We think we're off to a pretty strong start actually in terms of at least our bookings activity. But we expect relative to last year, for health care attachment to be higher than it was. The contribution from health care attachment will be higher than it was last year. We just couldn't hit the numbers that we hit last year. We had also seen simultaneously that the base business [indiscernible] was going down [indiscernible] in very difficult challenging. So we expect growth in the business, growth in clients, we expect growth in attachment that's what's really kind of driving the [indiscernible] less so Tien-Tsin, I think that's less of an issue. Typically, just to remind everyone, our PEO clients are typically upper 20s and low 30s. In terms of clients, we're not trying to go down [indiscernible] necessarily. But it's really going to come from more clients that are [indiscernible]. John Gibson : And we're just really not expecting any type of major pricing increases either on the health side or on the general administrative fee side and it's going to be well within our normal course. Although I would mention that on the health care side, our normal course is in the single digits, which far [indiscernible] on an historical basis with health care inflation. So that's a benefit and a retention benefit for our clients. The other thing probably we haven't talked about, we have a thesis around is if we had very good HR outsourcing growth, and one of the things that we saw because of the insurance anomaly was a tilt towards our ASO product. And so we look on the aggregate, we\u2019ve very, very solid year, our HR outsourcing offerings, ASO and [indiscernible] and PEO, but we tilted towards one versus the other. We're actually -- we actually, I look at that now and say, wait a minute, I now have more clients that love our technology, love our HR and now it's just a matter of finding the right health care solution and going back and upselling them into the PEO. We have a pretty concentrated effort on that. Actually that\u2019s another area where we're using AI where we are actually analyzing the deduction feeds from existing payroll and ASO customers so that we can triangulate what we think they are currently paying for health care. And then using the demographic data that we have to do AI-based underwriting to give us a computer based targeted list of clients that we can approach within a really almost prepackaged value proposition that says hey, we think we can help you save money on your insurance. If you join our PEO, you're already a ASO client of ours, so we're just getting -- we've been working on that model for 9 months as part of our efforts and that's an area to that we think there's opportunity inside our base to go back with our insurance value proposition in the PEO and see if we [indiscernible] some clients over. Tien- Tsin Huang : And that's the beauty of Paychex having both ASO and PEO. So I guess as my follow-up, any change in your appetite on the whole self insured versus the fully guaranteed PEO model to the extent that you can better maybe control the insurance packages. And I know Efrain [indiscernible] try to trick you guys answer the consolidation question, but I'll ask it to. So right appetite to do acquisitions on the PEO side? I know it's been, what 5 years since you did [indiscernible]. You said tuck-ins, but I know there's been some news in the market around consolidation, I know that probably is a multi part question. So I'm on the bad guys. Efrain Rivera : No, no Tien-Tsin. Tien- Tsin Huang : Just get anyway, thank you. Efrain Rivera : [Indiscernible]. Hey, let me answer the first one. I get that question and I think investors are sensitive to the level of balance sheet [indiscernible]. So when we originally did this a number of years ago, I said I don't want to be recorded quarters when we blew up the balance sheet because we were doing the wrong things on the insurance side. I was -- [indiscernible] resourced. What I mean by that is just taking excessive risks. So everyone knows what they get when they invest in a company. And we have managed that without any hiccup because two things help us. One is that even though we don't risk, we don't make money, we make very little money on health care insurance. And that removes the incentive to necessarily push insurance, cheap insurance as a way of selling PEO, that's a fool's game. We don't play it, we will never play it. Having said that, as we get to a certain density in markets and many of people on the call know what the big markets are, we look at that we evaluate whether a -- [indiscernible] risk and insurance in a market would make sense, I won't forestall that we would not, but it will be subject to the same very tight criteria. And the other part is the reason for doing it would not be necessarily to increase revenue, but for us to capture share in that market. So nothing imminent, but that's our thought process. I think we've got that have a track record in terms of managing it in an appropriate way. I'll let John talk to PEO and M&A. John Gibson : Yes, just to add to that, I don't think that our current approach to insurance in the PEO was a driver to what we saw last year. And so I don't think taking more risk is necessarily the solution. I think that our current approach has demonstrated that we can grow at industry rates without exposing ourselves to additional risk. And so to Efrain's point, I don't see that as a magic [indiscernible]. I don't think you need that to grow the PEO value proposition to Efrain's point to the degree in which we thought it could accelerate growth in some way and the risk could be balanced. It's something to consider, but not something that we're looking at. I mean, I think in terms of the PEO M&A front, we haven't done much in 5 years. It's obviously a very attractive industry for private equity to pay very high multiples for which -- for in my opinion, not much capability. When we made the acquisition of Oasis, we were looking at those getting significant scale on the PEO and capability. We got that with Oasis. We were typically a smaller kind of regional PEO and we [indiscernible] national scale to get there, we're now top player in the industry. So I think what we would be looking forward is tuck-ins in markets. Would that make sense? If we were going to add a capability, right, but a capability in terms of something different in the PEO that's interesting. But, again, when I continue to see as we're involved in and know about almost every deal in the industry, I still think the multiples are a little high for what they would bring value and we have enough organic and inside the base opportunity for us to continue to invest our dollars. Tien- Tsin Huang : Awesome. Thanks for the complete answer. I promise just one question. Thank you guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Hey, good morning. Just a couple of quick follow-up. Hey, thanks. Just a couple of quick follow-up for me. On the out of business commentary, I understand kind of the conditions there where you maybe were below normal, especially during the height of the pandemic, and that's normalized. I'm just wondering, if right now you would characterize that out of business run rate as being more elevated still, or is it kind of come back more into line with what you would expect to be kind of normal? John Gibson : It's back to normal. And again, I go back to say, it's back to normal pre-pandemic '19, which again were at reasonably, historically low levels for us, if you went back historically before that. So, look, there was a big surge in new business starts, right at the start of the pandemic. And we knew in our models, whether or not there was recession, whether or not interest rates were 1% or 6%, those businesses, a fair number of them were not going to survive after 2 years. And so we didn't know whenever it's going to come, but I think we knew what was going to come, I think we've seen that begin to flush through, we've kind of returned back to what I would say are more normal business start levels. And again, business starter is still reasonably solid. We're not seeing a dip in business starts. Again, the big spike, we're now back to where we were kind of pre-pandemic, which again were very, very solid and conducive numbers for growth in our business before the pandemic. James Faucette : Yes, yes. No, that makes sense. Appreciate that. And then just a quick question to make sure that we're thinking about business sensitivities correctly. If we were to see macro deteriorate further, which of the underlying verticals, whether it be payroll, HCM software, retirement, HR management solutions would be hit hardest versus what would be most resilient. I think we have some ideas there. But I just want to make sure we're thinking about that correctly. Efrain Rivera : Yes, I'd say -- so you got two points of comparison, kind of what happened in 2007, and '08 and then what happened during the pandemic. What we saw during the pandemic was that on the PEO side, PEO was our base, at least, a PEO client shed employees more quickly. I was surprised by the speed with which they did it. I think you'd see more of an impact there on the PEO, if you saw more of a sharp downturn. And a garden variety of softness, probably not. And then second, James, it will see but it would go back certainly due to pandemic you saw employers start to shed clients and shed employers, I should say, shed employees. Interestingly enough, what was a little bit anomalous during the pandemic, we didn't see huge client losses. But what we did see them drop employees. And so when -- then you'd see an impact, I'd remind everyone that our model is not a pure people model, subscription plus people. And so we have some insulation in the event that there's a downturn and overall unemployment levels fall. And finally, last caveat, we do have the ability to pivot in the base, which we did during the pandemic, which helped to mitigate the impact of what was going on in the economy as a whole. John Gibson : Yes, and I would probably say we're actually more effective in terms of both our capabilities, [indiscernible] to be able to target inside the base, our capabilities from a sales and marketing and digital perspective inside the base than we were in any of the -- in the prior downturn. And we just have gotten very, very effective in driving product penetration and identifying opportunities within our client base where we can add additional value with a pretty broad set of products and services. James Faucette : That's great. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Unidentified Analyst : Its [indiscernible] on for Mark. Thank you for taking our questions. So I'll just leave it at one. Retirement solutions continues to see strong growth and clearly has some nice tailwinds. Can you talk about some of the measures you're taking to capitalize on the opportunity provided by both the SECURE Act as well as state mandates? John Gibson : Yes, so as you know we're a leader in small and midsized businesses in terms of the number of plans we manage more retirement plans than any other company. For the [indiscernible] year, we actually have prepared and supportive businesses, more businesses than any other provider. So we are actively already educating our existing customers, and have a variety of digital marketing programs in the market. I think you'll continue to see more aggressive positioning of Paychex in the 401(k). We're looking at how it can play a bigger role in our bundles, and all of our payroll bundles as well, because again, what we're finding is given both the state mandate coupled with the SECURE -- the SECURE Act 2.0 we're literally, if you're a company of 20 employees, and we're working on trying to make some changes to that legislation that actually drop it down even lower than that, we can start up a 401(k) plan, and basically at no cost to you and you can then provide up to $1,000 of match to your employees, and get that money back as well. So when you -- this is like one of those ERTC moments where our value proposition of what we can go to a small business owner and say, you can have a valuable benefit that's going to help you retain your employees, help you attract employees and [indiscernible] it's not going to cost you anything to get it started. We think there's a powerful value proposition. And like I said, we're already the largest -- we already know how to do this. We already have the sales and marketing capabilities and operational capabilities to do this in a very efficient and effective way. And so we're going to continue to capitalize on this as we go into this fiscal year. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Samad Samana : Hi. Great. Thanks for -- hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. So I just wanted to ask on maybe your own sales organization. Can you help us think through just between the last couple of years being strong and then us entering, let's say, a slightly different environment, maybe looking forward. How maybe the sales organization performing versus quota [ph] in fiscal '23? And maybe what assumptions around quota you're thinking for fiscal '24 in terms of that quota increases for your sales organization? John Gibson : Well, as I said, we were very pleased with the record setting year that we had in sales execution. It really was a stellar year from a sales performance perspective, my hat's off to the entire team. And as I said, the back half was stronger than the front half. And given that momentum we have coming out of there, the investments we made in the fourth quarter in terms of marketing, also a lot of work on what I would say is go-to-market support for our sales teams. The things we're doing relative to sales training and sales effectiveness tools that we invested in the fourth quarter, given the momentum, we've seen our sales team, it's readily and happily accepted higher quotas for fiscal year '24. Samad Samana : Appreciate that. Efrain, I'd love to ask you another PEO follow-up question, but I'll [indiscernible]. Efrain Rivera : Go ahead. I will give you one. Samad Samana : I\u2019m joking. I\u2019m going to [indiscernible] question. You guys have a great day. [Indiscernible]. Thanks, guys. Efrain Rivera : Yes, thanks. Operator : Thank you. There are no additional questions at this time. We'd like to now turn it back to our presenters for any closing remarks. John Gibson : Okay. Well, I'd like to thank everybody for being with us today. I know probably many of you are starting to head or intended or about to head to the 4th of July weekend. Hope you have a great time with your family. Thank you for your questions and support. I want to reflect again on this past fiscal year, certainly a transition year for me. Coming in -- into the new position as CEO, an absolutely phenomenal year for the company. The employees did a great job navigating a very complex fiscal year, and for the company to achieve that $5 billion milestone is really a testament to their hard work. And to do it, it's the speed we did it during the global pandemic. It's something to say, I was reflecting last night as I was looking back over the last 5 year results across the board and I go back and anchor myself the fiscal year '19, which is hard to remember that was before the pandemic and I looked at our fourth quarter and I looked at our full year statistics and when you go down there and see we had better revenue growth, better profit growth, better retention metrics that are HR outsourcing metrics, that are new sales revenue, better new sales unit rates of growth in the fourth quarter of this past fiscal year and the full year than we had in fiscal year '19. We not only weathered the pandemic, but I think we actually came out of the pandemic in a stronger position across the board. And I just want to thank the 16,000 employees at Paychex for making that happen. And hope you all have a very nice 4th of July weekend. Thank you very much. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That conclude today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this call is being recorded, and I will be standing by if you should need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to John Gibson. John Gibson : Thank you, Shelby. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex first quarter fiscal year '24 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Schrader, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. The teleconference is being broadcast online and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start the call with an update on the business highlights for the first quarter. I'll then turn it over to Efrain and Bob for a financial update, and then, we'll open it up for your questions. But before getting into the discussion of our earnings results, I want to take a brief moment here to make a few brief comments to acknowledge Efrain Rivera, who announced his intention to retire as CFO effective October 12, 2023; though he will remain as a Senior Advisor at least through the end of the calendar year. Efrain has been a valuable member of this senior leadership team at Paychex for the past 12 years. He has provided strong financial stewardship, but more importantly, great strategic leadership as well. During his time with Paychex, the company has transformed into a technology-enabled services company and we significantly expanded our HR Solutions and capabilities. Efrain has been a key strategic advisor and a catalyst for this transformation. Efrain, I think you know how truly I appreciate your intellectual wisdom, your integrity, the guidance you've given me personally over my decade here and to the company. And we are all in great gratitude for what you've done for each one of us personally and for the company. Our customers, our employees and our shareholders are better off because you were here. So, thank you. Joining us today is Bob Schrader, who will succeed Efrain as CFO. Bob joined Paychex back in 2014 and is taking on progressive leadership roles over the past nine years, including over the last year and a half since I was named President and subsequent CEO of being co-lead of many of our strategic review efforts and strategic initiatives. Bob's promotion is a part of a strategic succession plan to bring in an innovative leader who will continue to guide the company going forward. I want to congratulate Bob and, Bob, I look forward to continuing to work with you as I have in the last 10 years, I mean, as we continue to -- continue our track record of delivering strong financial results and continuing to position Paychex as a leader and innovator and a company that you can count on for predictable and sustainable results. Now, moving on to the first quarter results, speaking of predictability and sustainability. We have begun the fiscal year '24 with solid growth of 7% in total revenue and 11% in adjusted diluted earnings per share. We've seen operating margin expansion approximately 60 basis points year-over-year, while still investing in our business to drive future growth. Our first quarter reflected solid execution by our sales, service and all of our teams across Paychex. The demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions continued, resulting in strong quarter new sales, revenue growth, we saw positive trends in client, revenue and HR outsourcing worksite employee retention during the quarter, and we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high-value clients. We are starting to see improvements in some of our key PEO and insurance metrics during the quarter, with good results across sales activity, insurance attachment and retention. We will know more after our open enrollment season is completed, which primarily runs from October through January, but at this time, we believe that the actions we have taken in response to the headwinds we faced in 2023 are beginning to gain traction. Employment levels within our client base have remained stable. Small businesses, which are central to the U.S. economy, continue to show the resiliency. Our Small Business Employment Watch has shown that small businesses continue to add workers at sustained, but modest rates, also the trend in wages is showing some cooling in wage growth consistent with overall inflation. Our data indicate a continued stable macro-environment for small and mid-sized businesses. We continue to monitor our leading indicators and are prepared to take appropriate actions to navigate any changes. But again, at this time, we don't see any material change to the macro-environment. Small businesses have faced challenges getting access to capital and managing cash flows in this environment. This has continued to drive demand for our full-service Employee Retention Tax Credit Service. I know there's been some recent news of the IRS pause in ERTC processing in order for them to perform increased audits. This is not expected to have an impact on our ability to provide the service, though it may take longer for our clients to receive their funds. We continue to communicate this opportunity to existing clients and prospects and we continue to file amended returns with the IRS on their behalf. We anticipate that ERTC revenue will be a slight tailwind for the first half of the fiscal year and then turn to a headwind in the back half as the program ends. We are seeing greater adoption of HR software as businesses look to digitize their HR efforts to support the complexities of managing today's workforce in a more efficient manner. We also continue to see strong demand for our HR advisory solutions as businesses deal with the continued challenges of being an employer in today's challenging employment world. Paychex is uniquely positioned to offer a continuum of HR products, technology and services from do-it-yourself payroll all the way to full-service PEO HR outsourcing. All of these products deliver a strong return on investment for our clients. For the 13th year in a row, we were named the leading retirement record-keeper by number of plans by PLANSPONSOR Magazine. Our leadership position in retirement makes us an excellent resource for small businesses and we continue to educate and execute on this opportunity. There have -- there has certainly been a lot of excitement about AI and related technology and advancement around the monetization of large datasets. At Paychex, as we've talked on prior calls, this isn't anything new or it's not a fact. We have been using artificial intelligence to transform our business for over a decade. We have over 200 AI models that are actively working on our business today, designed to provide valuable insights, fueled by our vast data assets. Our award-winning Retention Insights tool uses AI-based predictive analytics to provide HR leaders with early insights into potential employee retention issues. Our Flex Intelligence Engine is an embedded AI chat capability within our Flex platform that allows the customer to get quick answers to over 900 of the most common questions and access over 1,200 instructional resources. Companies like Paychex with large amounts of data will clearly be the winner with AI, and we will continue to harness the power of AI and leverage our extensive data to drive internal efficiencies and provide actionable insights and solutions to our clients. This quarter, we continued to be recognized for our innovation, service and the positive impact we are having on our customers, our industry and the world. For the third time, Paychex has been recognized by TrustRadius with a 2023 Tech Cares Award for the company's Corporate Social Responsibility programs and our community impact. We also received an award from Selling Power for our commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce, and from Forbes as one of the Best Employers for Women in 2023. On the product and service side, NelsonHall, once again, identified Paychex as the leader in its 2023 Next Generation HCM Technology Market Report. We also earned at silver Brandon Hall Group 2023 HR Excellence Award for breadth and depth of training that we provide our HR advisors to keep them up to speed on the ever-changing complexities of the employer-employee relationship. Paychex was also named the 2023 Constellation Research on their ShortList for best payroll for North American small and mid-sized businesses. The depth and breadth of our product suite provide American businesses the freedom to succeed with the technology and advice that they desperately need to remain competitive in a very complicated world. I want to thank our over 16,000 global employees who consistently deliver for our clients and our shareholders. It's because of them that we are off to such a good start this fiscal year. I'll now turn it over to Bob Schrader to give you a brief update on our financial results for the first quarter. Bob? Bob Schrader : Yeah, thanks, John, and good morning. It's good to be here with you this morning, and I certainly look forward to working with each of you as we move forward. I'd like to remind everyone that today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements; obviously, those involve risk. And we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. I'll refer you to our customary disclosures in our press release and our investor presentation that will be posted later today. I'll start providing a summary of our first quarter results and I'm going to turn it over to Efrain, he'll give an update on our financial position and updated guidance for the year. Total revenue for the quarter increased 7% to $1.3 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 6% to $956 million, primarily driven by higher clients and client employees, product penetration, price realization and HR ancillary services. We continue to see increased attachment and demand for our HR Solutions, retirement, and time and attendance solutions. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 5% to $298 million, driven primarily by higher revenue per client and higher average worksite employees. As John mentioned, we definitely saw some positive momentum in the PEO in the first quarter as it relates to both sales activity in medical plan participation and attachment, those were obviously headwinds last year, and we are definitely seeing some positive signs as we move through the first quarter here. Interest on funds held for clients increased 83% to $33 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates. Total expenses increased 5% to $750 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher compensation costs, PEO direct insurance costs and investments that we've made into the business. Operating income increased 8% to $536 million, with an operating margin of 41.7%, that's a 60 basis point improvement versus the prior-year period. And diluted earnings per share increased 10% to $1.16 per share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11% for the quarter to $1.14 per share. I'll now turn it over to Efrain to take you through our financial position and our updated guidance for the year. Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone on the call. Before I start, just wanted to say thank you, John, for the generous words. It's been an absolute professional privilege and honor to have been with Paychex during all this time. As you all know, we maintain a strong financial position with high quality cash and earnings. Our balance for cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments with more than $1.7 billion. Total borrowings were approximately $812 million as of August 21, 2023. Cash flows from operations were $656 million for the first quarter, was driven by net income and changes in working capital. There was some influence of timing there. It wasn't quite as strong as the percentages would indicate, but nonetheless, it was a very solid quarter. As you know, our earnings quality, which many -- some of you have pointed out, is among the best candidly in the entirety of the S&P 500. In the first quarter, we acquired a small company that purchases outstanding accounts receivable of their customers under non-recourse arrangements. This acquisition is a good strategic fit with another business that we have called Paychex Advance, and that business purchases accounts receivable for temporary staffing clients. This acquisition will provide an opportunity for our small business clients to manage working capital challenges. As John alluded to earlier, we've seen over the last several years that access to financing is very important for small and medium-sized businesses. We think this plays well into our -- in our portfolio of businesses that we have. I'm very excited to have it. The acquisition, at this stage, is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial results this year. We paid a total of $322 million in dividends during the first quarter. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was a stellar, superb, amazing 47%. Now, let me turn to guidance for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2024. I'm going to give you color on not only the full year, the first half and the second half, and we typically do that at this stage. As you noted, we have raised guidance for interest on funds held for clients and for adjusted EPS, but I want to go through a little bit of color as we go through to give you a sense of what our thinking is. Our current outlook is as follows : You saw that Management Solutions still expected to grow in the range of 5% to 6%. PEO and Insurance Solutions expected to grow in the range of 6% to 9%. Interest on funds held for clients now, as I have mentioned, expected to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million, raised from our previous guide of $135 million to $145 million. And before I get the question, are we anticipated a range -- are we anticipating a range of additional increases, no, we are poised looking at what the Fed is doing just like everyone else is, but this is our best estimate of, at least some additional activity by the Fed, but not -- likely not contemplating all of it to the extent that the Fed does something now. We'll have a conversation later in the year. Maybe the Fed will decide that they actually do want to pause, but at this point, that's where we anticipate being. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 7%, but now we think this is likely towards the high end of the range. So, operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $30 million to $35 million. The effective income tax expected to be in the range of $24 million to $25 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 9% to 11%, and this is raised from our previous guide of 9% to 10%. This full year outlook assumes current macroeconomic conditions, which has some uncertainty surrounding future interest rate changes and their impact on the economy. And I would just say, it's been almost -- I would say, at least six quarters where we keep saying, \"Hey, we don't know what's going to happen in the back half of the year and it could change our outlook.\" I think John summarized it very well. At this point, things look pretty stable. So, we are feeling directionally more and more confident in the back half. Projecting the second half of the year, we anticipate total revenue growth of approximately 7% and operating margin in the range of 42% to 43%. I heard some comments after -- first -- when we released guidance that we have a ramp in the back half of the year. I wouldn't describe our current guidance as a significant ramp in the back half of the year. Obviously, there are differences in the back half of the year that we'll navigate through and talk to you, but the difference between first half and second half is not dramatic. Of course, all of these comments are subject to our current assumptions, which are subject to change. We will update you again on the second quarter call. So, let me just repeat a couple of things to make sure. First half 2024 total revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7%, operating margin in the range of 40% to 41%. And then, in the second half at this point, we anticipate total revenue growth to be approximately 7%, operating margin in the range of 42% to 43%. I refer you to our investor slides on the website for additional information. Before handing things back over to John, I would just like to say that, I appreciate the relationship I've built with each of you during my time here at Paychex. We've had a long time together and it's time to hand the reins over to someone else who I think we'll do an even better job than I have. One of the things that strikes me during that entire time, and many of you have been here for the entire ride, I got a call and someone -- or I got note and someone said, \"Efrain you're making me old, because I've retired two CFOs at Paychex.\" So, I think that's unfortunately true. We are all getting a little bit older. But one of the things that always strikes me is that we are covered by the best group of analysts in the business. I'd say that even though I have disagreed with some of you over the years and I still think you have us rated too low, but be that as it may, I can't argue with some of the things that you write. And in a separate note, I just want to say this, I've worked with Bob Schrader for many years, both here and prior to Paychex. I know that I'm leaving you in very capable hands. And I'm sure that Bob will do an even better job than the one that I do. And with that, let me turn it back to John. John Gibson : Well, thank you, Efrain. Before I open the call for questions, probably two things. One, we have a lot of people here and the last time Efrain did a great job of providing rules on questions, particularly on compound questions and multiple follow-ups. So, we could just follow the Efrain rule in honor of Efrain's retirement. I know he would greatly appreciate it, and maybe we can create a new tradition here. But no, feel free to answering your questions. But I would like to also add, make everyone aware, there's many ways you can learn more about Paychex, and really the amazing success stories and the impact that we are having on the world. We've recently launched a series of reports that you can find on our Investor page both our annual report, our ESG report and a new client impact report, and very shortly, you'll be seeing a new Investor Relations 101 Presentation that will be launched on the website prior to our Annual Meeting in the coming weeks. And again, I think these documents provide a lot more color and really a lot more insights of just how significant, how broad our products are, how big an impact we are having on our customers, how big an impact we are having on our employees, how and why Paychex is known as one of the most admired, most ethical and most innovative companies in the world, and I encourage you to check that out. So, with that advertisement of our Investor website, Shelby, you can now turn it over for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi. Thank you for taking my question, and congratulations to you, Efrain. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Ramsey El-Assal: We will miss hearing your voice on these calls certainly. I was wondering if you could comment on the interest from corporate investments was relatively high in the first quarter, and it doesn't necessarily feel like that's going to flow through for -- to the full year guide in terms of maybe recurring each quarter. So, maybe if you could talk about that contribution to other income and just how you might see it trending the rest of the year? Efrain Rivera : Yeah. So, Ramsey, there's a couple of things that go into that line beyond just -- so for everyone who isn't focusing on that line that much. So that's a combination of our interest expense, our interest income from corporate portfolios primarily, and also some gains and losses on investments that we have in small investment fund that we have. Those things can swing a bit during the year and are subject to whatever we think the balance is going to be on corporate funds during the year. We made an acquisition, so we expect that. During the year, our average corporate balances will be lower. So that will generate lower interest income. And then, the other part of that, Ramsey, is gains and losses on that other investments as the mark-to-market can change from quarter-to-quarter. So, there could be a little bit of lumpiness in that number, but it might be a little bit different. I would say one other thing just by way of color on that line. We ended up with a fairly high cash balance that was influenced by timing. I think, I called that out,, or if I didn't, let me call it out now. It just really had to do with the day on which we closed the quarter so our cash balances were higher. They are likely to be a bit lower -- not a bit lower, but lower as we progress through the year. So, you might see that number change a bit. Ramsey El-Assal: Okay. Fantastic. And a quick follow-up. If you could talk about SECURE Act 2.0? How you see that evolving? And how you see that potentially -- presumably benefiting the business over time? John Gibson : Yeah, look, SECURE Act 2.0, I think is a great action and great step that the government has taken is encouraging and helping small and mid-sized businesses, provide for the retirement of their employees. We are certainly out there educating the market on the opportunity. It really provides an opportunity for them to add a 401(k) plan or get a tax credit back for the implementation fees or the set-up fees of the plan. And then allows them to actually do a match for their employees and get that back into a tax credit as well. So, we are very happy our 401(k) business has continued -- has very, very strong growth, that has continued. The thing I continue to remind people, we have some experience in this in other state mandates and what we realized is that there's a lot of education that has to go on to get the market educated about the cost of a 401(k) plan, the benefits of a 401(k) plan. And certainly, we are out actively in the market, educating the market, educating our strategic partners on that, and we believe that the SECURE Act 2.0 is going to allow us to continue to sustain the double-digit growth rates that we've seen in the retirement business over the last several years. Ramsey El-Assal: Fantastic. Thank you very much. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open. Daniel Maxwell : Hey, good morning, guys. This is Daniel Maxwell on for Andrew today. To start off, I was hoping you could dig in a little on any changes to the dynamic between ASO and PEO, and whether over the past couple of months, you've seen any preferences shift on that. You called it out the last couple of quarters, and I was wondering, if anything changed. John Gibson : Yeah. So, I would say this, we continue to see strong demand for our HR outsourcing solutions across the board. And I would say that the balance is probably more back to prior to '23, where we saw a little shift to ASO. We've seen more of what -- more traditional balance of ASO to the PEO. As we mentioned on our last call, we've made some changes I think to our product portfolio in the PEO that I think is balanced that out a little bit. The other thing that I would point to that we mentioned on the prior call is that when we over-index with ASO in the prior year, we always look at that as a great opportunity for us to go back to those customers and then upgrade them or selective them into our PEOs product. And we started doing that. We actually -- that's a good example of AI, where we are actually using AI tools to be able to go into the ASO base and find clients that we believe there's going to be a valuable value proposition to be in the PEO relationship for multitude of different reasons, and that program actually has shown results in the first quarter. It's early in the process, but I would tell you that our transition of ASO to PEO customers, the number of customers that we transitioned this first quarter versus last first quarter was nearly 2x the number of clients. So, exactly what we thought could happen, which was we over-indexed when ASO in the prior fiscal year. We continue to sell outside to new logos and that was also double-digit strong in PEO in the first quarter. So, we have both benefits. We had strong outside the base growth in PEO in the first quarter, and we had good migration or upgrades ASO to PEO, which was a good start to the first quarter. We still got three quarters to go and we are in the middle of our open enrollment, which is critical there. But good early signs. We had good signs in the PEO in the fourth quarter, and we've talked about that on the last call, and that just accelerated in the first quarter. So, now we just got to see if that can continue into the core selling season. Daniel Maxwell : Great. Good to hear. And then for my follow-up, any detail you can give on the increase to the direct insurance costs from workers' comp? Any color or any reminder of your exposure to any volatility in that area? Bob Schrader : Yeah. This is Bob here. I mean, we, obviously, take risk in the PEO business on workers' comp. Obviously, we are very prudent in managing that risk in which -- and picking on which risk we are willing to take. I'd say there is growth in the quarter, primarily driven by, we have growth in worksite employees, that is going to drive higher workers' compensation costs. We go through every quarter and do true-ups of our reserves and so forth, but nothing specific to call out other than growth in the business that would drive growth in direct costs. John Gibson : Yeah. There has been no change to our underwriting standards. There's no change to our programs in terms of caps and limits, and there is no real change in the overall program performance. Daniel Maxwell : All right. Thanks a lot, guys, and congrats again to Efrain on your retirement and Bob on your promotion. Bob Schrader : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Bryan Bergin : Hi. Good morning, guys. Thank you. Efrain and Bob, let me echo my congrats as well. Efrain, it's been nice working with you here. Enjoy your retirement. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Bryan Bergin : I got to ask the question because we've gotten a lot of question, just as it relates to ERTC. So, it doesn't sound like you have any change in your fiscal '24 revenue expectation there surrounding ERTC after this recent IRS announcement, but can you just dig in there a little bit more since there have been a lot of questions? Is there any evidence of any clients wanting to potentially delay submitting new claims there? Any dynamic there to be mindful of? John Gibson : Listen, Bryan, appreciate the question. Look, ERTC was in line with our expectations in the first quarter. We continue to submit. No one is wanting to delay. The program is going to end. And, I -- again, the IRS announcement is not stopping anyone's efforts -- our efforts in approaching clients who are assisting and then filing the tax credits. And in fact, the IRS specifically commented to clients and small business owners that they should seek trusted partners to complete their filings. The IRS pause in processing that, and accepting. So they're accepting filings. It's really due to some just really bad actors out there that are providing bad advice to small businesses and putting them at risk. I talked about this probably a year ago when this started when these little pop-up companies started to show up. And again, I think the IRS is trying to do a prudent thing to tamp down on fraud and also to make sure these small businesses are not getting bad advice from these pop-up firms. So, we actually are continuing to accept and encouraging our clients and prospects to file, and we provide a service where we are confident that the advice we are giving them is adequate and we'll continue to try to get their processing done before the filing deadline early next calendar year. The delay impact for the client is really going to be in the processing, which is really going to be when they get the refund. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Very good. That's clear. And then, my follow-up, just on the target here. Can you share as it relates to the M&A the financial profile of this target? Just any revenue attribution to call out now included in the current year outlook? I did hear you mentioned, I believe, the upper end of your growth range. But just wanted to confirm there were no organic offsets of that. Efrain Rivera : Organic offsets, which... Bryan Bergin : As far as anything in the organic side being offset by now any incremental inorganic in the year? Efrain Rivera : Not really, Bryan. I mean, it will contribute a modest amount of revenue, we'll call it out as we go through the year. But it's not masking something or additive in that respect. I think there's a number of different vectors of growth within the company that are working pretty well. So, no, not really. Bryan Bergin : All right. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Yeah, you're welcome. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my question. And Bob and Efrain, congrats to both of you. Just on my question, I wanted to better understand the raising of the guidance and confidence in the back half. Is that both on Management Solution as well as PEO? Any color on that front? Thanks. Efrain Rivera : Yeah. So, one is, kind of, I'd say, process and structural, and then, the second is the substance of what we saw in the first half. So, the process and the substance is simply that, at a point in time you're taking a snapshot and saying, okay, when we issued the guidance back four months or so ago, we had a certain set of macro conditions. We didn't know of it, whether they would hold at that point. The macro conditions, as John said earlier, haven't changed significantly. So, we fast forward four months and now we have more certainty as to what environment we are looking at, at least in the medium-term. Medium-term being three to six months. So that's one. The second part is, we look at the trends in the business where we close, where we correct in terms of the trends that we saw. You heard some of the comments that John said on the PEO, so much of that was what we expected from an execution standpoint, but it's one thing to expect it, it's another thing to deliver it, and thus far we've started on a good note. So those are those are two parts of it. So, by the time we get to September and we are in the October now. We know with reasonable degree of certainty what Q2 looks now. We project forward into the back half of the year and do we feel reasonably confident based on the combination of all the factors that we are seeing at the back half expectations will be as we expect. As we sit here, the answer is yes. So, as you look at the guidance it anticipates that PEO will strengthen in the back half of the year. And at this point, we are seeing indications. Can we say that with certainty? You can never say anything certainly. But we -- based on all of that combination of factors, we feel pretty positive about where things are turning. John Gibson : Yeah, just to add on to that, I think, again, every business has -- we have a rhythm and the third quarter is a critical -- that's our selling season. And so, what the macroenvironment will be in the third quarter, fourth quarter, those are all the things we are trying to guess. I think what I would characterize it at this point in time is when we left the fourth quarter, I talked about the second half of our last fiscal year, we actually saw new sales bookings, both in Management Solutions and the PEO and Insurance accelerating. We continue to see that double-digit momentum in the first quarter, HR outsourcing, ASO and PEO, strong mid-market in the quarter, retirement is strong, digital payroll is strong. So, when we look at the demand environment, then we look at the employment environment with our index and what we are seeing the first quarter set-up to be kind of a repeat and continuation of what we saw in the second half and particularly the fourth quarter. Now as it relates to the PEO business as we talked about the insurance is a portion of that, insurance attachment is part of the reason why we have a little bit of a wider range. What you have to determine there is, how many companies continue to offer benefits to their employees? That's the first choice. The second choice is, how many of those employees sign up for Health Insurance, and what plans do they sign up for? Now, we are only a quarter way through that decision process, which really is already started, about 25% of the way through. What I would say at this 25% away, we are running a little bit on par, where we expected. I mean if that continues, I think that's what gives us confidence in the back half. But again, I still got three quarters of that process left and again, I want to be predictable relative to what we should expect. And so, we are being, I think prudently cautious in making sure that we are executing both Management Solutions, we are taking advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace, and then in the POE and Insurance, making sure we are doing what we need to do to make sure we have a successful open enrollment and drive insurance attachment. Ashish Sabadra : That's a great color. And maybe if I can just ask a quick follow-up question on the commentary on the PEO side on the improved insurance attach rate. Obviously, last quarter you had also talked about a leaner product and I was wondering if that's driving better adoption or you are seeing just better adopt -- demand or stronger demand for insurance product? Thanks. John Gibson : Yeah. So, I would say that there is a multitude of things that we probably tweaked every aspect of how we approach the insurance, both in terms of analytics of what we are doing relative to targeting customers that we think can drive -- we can drive value proposition there. We've changed the technology. We've changed our advisory approach, and we've expanded the products -- choices that both employers and employees can have. We've improved our educational tools in that process. We got a lot more engagement with our HR advisors, with clients around that. So, I would say, across the board after what we experienced a year ago in the first quarter, we've looked at every aspect of it and the team has really done a great job there and just re-imagining how we need to approach this. And again, we are only 25% of the way through, but we are seeing results from those activities. And, I do think demand for insurance, and I think it's going to be interesting. We were very pleased with our renewals. I mean, if you read in the general press right now, you will see that there is a degree of health inflation, and when that occurs, we do typically see more customers shopping for alternatives that we think we have a good value proposition there. Ashish Sabadra : That's a great color. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Scott Wurtzel : Great. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question. Maybe just going back to the acquisition. I'm just wondering if you could maybe give a little bit more color on the strategic rationale behind it and sort of said another way, like why now with this deal, and maybe relative to some of the other targets that you were looking at? Thanks. Efrain Rivera : Well, I'll bracket it in three ways. The first thing is that, as John alluded to or said earlier, the ability for small businesses to access funding -- in small and medium size, I should say, access funding is important. So, we had our eyes on looking to build our capability in that area. The second thing is, acquisitions are, as you would know, they don't always present themselves with exactly the timing which you would expect them to, and when an opportunity arises and you do what you need to do to take advantage of it. We saw an opportunity for high-quality asset and decided that it was the right time. And I would say the third is that, it's an interesting environment for small businesses, so where access to funding opportunities is becoming more tricky given what has happened with banks and with rising interest rates. So, we think the timing seemed to fit pretty well. And again, I don't spend too much time. It's a relatively modest acquisition based on our revenue side, but we think we've had a lot of success with our Paychex Advance acquisition, and it's a very profitable corner of the market. And we think we can do the same thing with the company that we bought, called the [indiscernible] by the way. John Gibson : Yeah. And I would just add, neither one of these things are new to us. We kind of get dragged into this. When COVID hit, if you remember the PPP program and the banks were struggling to figure out how to access it, and we put a program together, and that started a partnership with several fintechs. We did both technology, integrations, et cetera, and that led to a more of a partnership approach. And then, we have several partners that if we have clients that meet our risk profile and are wanting to maybe need to fund the payroll or something like that, we've got partners that we can introduce them to. So, we got kind of introduced to this concept and certainly then the macroenvironment, what Efrain just said, banks, rising interest rates, and we just know we have a lot of great customers out there, small, mid-size customers are strong businesses that just really struggled to get access to capital at affordable rates. And so, that started just through a partnership piece. And then we had the Advance business, which was kind of doing this for staffing companies and we've been in that. It has been a great business for us. It's a great acquisition business for us. Introduced us as a payroll customer. There's just a lot of positives there. And those are adjacent. And so literally, it's one of those classic, you're at a conference and you know people who know people and the timing seemed right. And just based upon the need we saw and the fact that we thought there were opportunities for us to potentially help our strong customers continue to grow their business. We've already been introducing them to partners. Why not introduce them to ourselves and get a piece of that action? So that was kind of the strategic rationale. And it's a small, like you said, very small at this point in time. Scott Wurtzel : Got it. That's super helpful. Thank you. And then, just as a follow-up. I mean, just one quickly on the float portfolio. When we think about the recent Fed commentary and dot plot showing maybe a sustained higher rate trajectory than maybe we were expecting a few months ago. I'm afraid, I know you've talked about in the past wanting to position the portfolio more on longer duration securities. I was just wondering if this -- the recent Fed commentary sort of gears you even more towards sort of the longer duration securities in the portfolio rather than shorter duration? Thanks. Efrain Rivera : Yeah. We are reviewing monthly to figure out based on and looking at the same dot plots you are to see what happens. I would just go back to something I've said from the point that the Fed started raising rates. The problem isn't taking advantage of the rates going up, the problem is what happens when it comes down. And so, we are positioning the portfolio, we will position the portfolio, and I'm sure Bob will do the same, to be able to manage it in an orderly way on the way down. So, we are looking at -- this is a time when you want to go longer, if you can, even if perhaps there are opportunities on the short-end of the curve, because at some point, it will come up, and that's what you got to figure out how best to manage, and that's what we are working on. Scott Wurtzel : Great. Thank you, and congrats, Efrain. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Efrain Rivera : Hi, Tien-Tsin. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hey, good morning. Thanks. I just wanted to follow-up on the acquisition, the $200 million acquisition here, and the strategic fit with Paychex Advance. I remember when that deal was announced and there was a lot about payroll funding and factoring and whatnot. Is this now more about early wage access and some of the more modern funding opportunities for employees? Just want to make sure I understand what you're adding specifically here. Efrain Rivera : Yeah, the short answer is no. So that's a separate initiative. At some point, we'll talk about when it becomes more significant. Now, Tien-Tsin, this what they do is more focused on receivable. So, obviously, we dipped our toe in the water with staffing firms, but we saw an opportunity that broader than that, because our -- all of our clients have to one degree or another, receivables, and it can become a source of financing. And we've got the data to make it work. Tien- Tsin Huang : Okay, very clear. So, this is an AR opportunity? Efrain Rivera : Yeah. Tien- Tsin Huang : Understood, okay. No follow-up for me. Just want to wish you, Efrain, all the best, of course, for the next chapter. And I've said it before, you've been really helpful for us for a long time. So, thanks for that. I definitely going to miss talking to you. Efrain Rivera : Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Peter Christiansen with Citigroup. Your line is open. Peter Christiansen : Good morning. Welcome, and congrats to Bob, and certainly congrats and thank you to Efrain. John, I wanted to dig a little bit into your thoughts on SMB lending in general. Obviously, this news of big money center bank is getting into the payroll business a bit more and SMB lending is often thought as a nice adjacency here. Should we consider the possibility that Paychex may further delve into SMB lending, whether it would be merchant cash advances or other types of working capital solutions? You see that in Paychex's future? John Gibson : No, well look, I think what we are trying to do is make sure that we are focused on what do we need to do to help our clients succeed. And as I said, whether that's through partnership or if there's opportunities for us to participate in that process integrating that with our technology, those are really the things that we are interested in. And when we hear our clients, and we are engaging those clients through our advisors on a constant basis, say, this is an issue for them, we go and search for answers, and partnerships are part of that. And as I said, we have several partnerships with fintechs that we are doing and relationships with large banks. I can go deeper on that if you want to know about banking and banks and payroll. We do -- we have businesses that do that. But I think, in general, you should not read anything more into this than the fact there is a need out there that we had an adjacent business that has been very successfully managed and has been a good return for our shareholders. And there was a natural relationship and opportunity that we thought by us coming in with our balance sheet, with our expertise, with our client base, that we could potentially make something of this. And so, I don't think you should read anything more into it than opportunistic acquisition that matches a need that we are seeing today from our customers, and one that based upon the macroenvironment, we think we are going to grow. And I don't think this is competition with any of the major banks. Most of these clients are just not getting access to the funds. It's just not available. And if there's more tightening at the regional bank, which is generally the go-to place for small and medium-sized businesses, that's not good for small business owners. And so, we are going to try to figure out how we can build partnerships to do that. Peter Christiansen : Well, thank you. That's super helpful. And then just as a follow-up, just wondering if you could call out any trends balance of trade-wise, are there areas where you see Paychex has an opportunity to improve the competitive dynamics or vice versa some areas where you're a bit more on defense versus offense? Just any sense on balance of trade versus some of your competitors and maybe some of the regionals as well? John Gibson : Well, I'll just say this, as we've talked about our sales momentum continues in the first quarter that we saw in the second quarter, on the macro side, when I'm looking at it, I'm not seeing any major shifts at all relative to balancing trade in the competitive environment. I commented on the fourth quarter. When I do look under it, again, these things go back and forth. I would say, it's raining a little more in our favor on the competitive front in several key areas that we monitor. We had a good first quarter in the mid-market. That was -- there were several good signs there as well, but it's not monumental. It's the same market, very stable competitive environment. Same set of competitors, low-end, mid, high-end PEO. It's the same cast of characters, same kind of pricing environment, competitive environment. It's a competitive marketplace. We'll leave it at that, and I think we are winning more than our fair share. Peter Christiansen : Yeah, for sure. Thanks again, and congrats, Efrain. Good luck. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Efrain Rivera : Hey, Bryan. Bryan Keane : Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask about the free cash flow increase year-over-year in the first quarter, it was substantial. I think it was up over 23%. How much of that was that one-time in working capital? And how much should that carry through the fiscal year? Or should we see a decreasing kind of growth rate in free cash flow to equal out the same growth of the 9% to 11% earnings growth by the time we get to the end of the fiscal year? Bob Schrader : Yeah, Bryan, this is Bob. I mean I think that's a fair way to think about it. I think as you guys know, we typically don't have big swings in our working capital. And as Efrain mentioned, we had a little bit of a timing there at the end of quarter. The quarter ended on a big collection day, so we had a big influx of cash that would go out the next day. So, the way to really think about our operating cash flows and then, obviously, free cash flow gets impacted by M&A. So, there was a little bit of an impact there in Q1 to free cash flows. But typically, our operating cash flows growth is going to trend in line with our net income growth. And so, you'll see that moderate as we move through the year and that's what you should expect from a growth standpoint. Bryan Keane : Got it. And then just a follow-up. I was hoping to get an update on what you guys are seeing for SMB bankruptcy rates. I know they have been a little bit elevated in the recent past here. And just curious if that's still at elevated levels or is it become more normalized? John Gibson : Yeah, no -- so, when we say elevated, I think that they are elevated over what we saw during the COVID period that's two, two-and-a-half years. Actually, bankruptcies are still slightly below where they were pre-pandemic and kind of trending toward a normalized rate. We have seen that. I would say, particularly in the start-up businesses when we had the big start-up boom, we've seen a lot more out of businesses on the very small -- I think we called that out in our press release. Revenue retention at near-record levels, and when you look at our HR outsourcing businesses at record levels. So that's what we've kind of seen on the bankruptcy side. The other interesting stat related to bankruptcy that kind of surprised me in the first quarter is we actually saw an uptick in new business starts. And again, we had this big elevated area and then we kind of gravitated back down towards kind of normal levels. And we actually saw in the first quarter new business starts click up, which was interesting. Bryan Keane : Got it. Great. And Efrain, it's been a real pleasure working with you. You'll be missed. Efrain Rivera : Thank you, Bryan. Appreciate it. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open. Samad Samana : Great. Thank you. Efrain, I'll echo, missing working with you and enjoy a well-deserved retirement, sir. Appreciate all the help over the years. Efrain Rivera : Appreciate it. Samad Samana : Maybe just a quick one for me. A lot of the questions have been asked. But just how are you guys seeing the top of the funnel in terms of inbound leads, the digital channel? Any change in maybe interest levels, registrations for webinars, just anything that we can look look at as a leading indicator of bookings? And how has that trended maybe in first quarter? John Gibson : Again, I'll go back, if our sales are growing at double-digit rates in the first quarter, digital is an ever-growing portion of that business where you can surmise that that's growing as well. So, we continue to see strong demand environment across the businesses, both digitally and really across the board, I wouldn't -- that's about it. Samad Samana : Great. And then maybe just on your own hiring plans with the quarter doing better than expected and maybe some trends you're seeing, any change to your own sales hiring plans or should we expect maybe the original game plan to be here? John Gibson : No, really no change in plans. We are certainly, in the second quarter, always in the staffing up and making sure we are fully staffed and able to cover any thought or planned attrition going in for the selling season, both on the service side and the sell-side. So, I think it's fair to say when you add now going on close to three quarters of strong demand, when you've been relatively, is it going to stay, is going to stay, yeah, we certainly want to make sure that we are properly staffed to take full advantage of all the opportunity in our selling season and we are fully staffed on the operations on the service side to make sure that we can both onboard and service these clients during year-end. Samad Samana : Great. Appreciate you taking my questions. Thank you. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Eugene Simuni with Moffettnathanson. Your line is open. Eugene Simuni : Thank you. Good morning, guys, and congratulations, Efrain and Bob. Efrain Rivera : Thank you, Eugene. Eugene Simuni : Efrain, we will miss working with you, and Bob look forward to working with you. Just have two quick follow-ups. One tying together your comments on sales and current, can you comment how it adds together to client growth trends this year so far? Last year, it was a bit below your historical target range and I think you commented that last quarter that this year you're looking for a reacceleration in client growth kind of above 2% a year. So, can you comment on how it's going so far? Efrain Rivera : Hey, Eugene, I'll start, then John [can make a comment] (ph). It really -- if I were to give you a number, it would give you some sort of false sense of what reality is. It's almost impossible to draw a conclusion on that where you are in first quarter. In some ways, some trends are positive and you can draw conclusions on project out through the year, but client base is really a tricky one. And the reason is you just lose so many and gain so many in the selling season that it's almost difficult to predict and we expect to be a bit better than we were last year, but it's still early innings. Eugene Simuni : Got it. Okay. And then, another follow-up is on the PEO and the question there is, in your PEO customer base, in terms of kind of checks per control, are you seeing any trends that are different from your overall base whether better or worse employment growth? John Gibson : Yeah, I would say it's probably consistent. We definitely see employees in our PEO -- clients in our PEO business adding employees. I wouldn't say it's a huge tailwind, but it's positive and probably in-line with what we are seeing in other areas of the business. Eugene Simuni : Got it. Okay. Thank you very much, guys. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open. Mark Marcon : Hey, good morning. Hey, Efrain, we go back a long way as it's been an absolute pleasure working with you. Efrain Rivera : Same here. Mark Marcon : I want to thank you for the relationship. And Bob, looking forward to working with you, but Efrain, it's been an absolute pleasure. Efrain Rivera : Thank you. Mark Marcon : A lot of questions have been on the short term. John, one big-picture question. A quarter ago everybody was asking about AI. Obviously, you've been -- Paychex has been doing a lot with AI for a long period of time. I'm wondering if you can just talk a little bit about -- now that some of these LLMs have been around for a couple of quarters and permeated the consciousness, how are you thinking about further evolution of your journey with AI? And what are the longer-term implications from a margin perspective or a scope of business perspective? John Gibson : Wow, that's -- Mark, that is a big question. Mark Marcon : Well, everybody is asking about the quarter... John Gibson : Yes, it is a great one, because I really think this is probably has the potential to be one of the biggest differentiators that's going to help company like Paychex, separate ourselves from the rest. Because as you said, the large language models, it starts with a large, and the only way that this works is you've got to have large sets of data and large sets of data coming through to continually train those models. I will also say relative to, it's expensive to do, and it's getting more expensive both in terms of finding the people and buying the technology, and I think that's going to also back some people out. But let me just give you some idea. I mean, we have multiple teams across the organization looking at every aspect of our business, front-office, back-office, G&A and evaluating how we could better leverage all of the capabilities of the data that we have. So, think of it today we are recording 6.5 million calls with our clients. This year, we are transcribing those call. We are using analytics to determine whether or not we have a service opportunity, or if we have a sales opportunity or an upsell opportunity in the conversations that we are having with our advisors. We are already doing almost 1 million natural language processing and analysis on our sales conversations with prospects looking for what are the right phrases, words, markets, segments where we are winning. And then adjusting that overnight and changing our sales play the next morning. Using some of that in our PEO, we've nearly doubled our close rates in the first quarter. I mean, I just could go on and on about where we are piloting and testing and using our data to do this. And so, I think there are tremendous opportunities. And then, when you begin to productize this and start thinking about the value that we can provide, the Retention Insights, which we launched, I keep bringing this up. We launched this a year-and-a-half ago. We won an award for AI and I think at the time, no one even wrote anything much about it. And because I don't think any people knew what AI was. And quite frankly it's -- I think that's just one example of multiple examples we are going to be able to drive more value to customers. And so, I think we are going to be able to go with a value proposition. And to be fair, there's other large competitors that probably are going to make similar claims, but I certainly think it's a differentiator. If you run a local payroll company, you're not going to have the same data and the insights that Paychex has relative to what's going on in your area, what's going on in the labor market. And if we can harness that and use technology to deliver that to our salespeople, our service people and our HR advisors, I think the trusted advisor position that we've already established ourselves for small and medium-sized businesses, it's only going to be further sustained and probably increase. So, I think Bob is going to -- has given me the hook to get off the bandwagon. [indiscernible] Mark Marcon : And then for my follow-up, just a quick question. Just in terms of the margin uplift from the first half to the second half, aside from normal seasonality and obviously float balances, certain forms of processing, is there anything to call out above and beyond that? Is it just pace of investments in the first half being a little bit front-end loaded? Efrain Rivera : Yeah, I think that's it. Mark, it's a couple of things. One is, we -- have you noticed the pattern in P&L, pretty obvious, we have attended to front-load a little bit more of spending, in part to make sure that we are prepared for selling season and then as we get into the fourth quarter typically we have heavied up our spending and anticipating -- in anticipation of starting the year stronger. Q3, as you know, because you could have that influx of annual processing, generally makes Q3 margins higher and then in Q4, I don't anticipate it would be quite as heavy as it has been in prior years when you combine those two, you get a little bit more spending in the first half, a little bit less in the back half, but more revenue in the back half, [indiscernible] margin uplift that I mentioned. There's nothing unusual about it. It's just the way that revenue and expenses flow through. Mark Marcon : Terrific. Thanks again, Efrain. I'll miss working with you. Efrain Rivera : Yeah, thank you. Operator : And we'll take our last question from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. James Faucette : Thank you very much. And I want to share my congratulations to Bob and Efrain. Just wanted to quick follow-up question here on PEO, and you had mentioned some of your customers, and I think you've kind of talked about this and had pulled back on providing ancillary services like insurance and 401(k), et cetera. But now you're calling out some growth in those same ancillary services as the driver of PEO growth in the quarter. What are the things that you're watching for to gauge like the durability of that improvement and kind of response by your customers and employers? Efrain Rivera : So, James, you mean, what are we looking at... James Faucette : Yeah, like what are the things in a more macroeconomy or even in your customer behavior to try to gauge and project the durability of that improvement? Efrain Rivera : Well, let me start, and then John and maybe Bob can weigh in. So, I just want to make sure that I'm answering the question correctly. I think the key thing in -- if you step back on the PEO is, we saw that attachment last year where we expected it to be. And also we saw an opportunity to tilt the balance a bit between what was an ASO sale versus a PEO sale. So, what we are looking at, at least to start the year is, first, are we positioned appropriately on the insurance side to be able to take advantage of that, and create momentum as we go into some key points in the year which occur in the fall and then at the beginning of the year on insurance and attachment. But one thing, James, that's important to point out, last year, when we were talking at this point, we were seeing actually something unusual where we are seeing clients dropping insurance and actually lowering their attachment -- I'm sorry, not their attachment, their enrollment. So, we haven't seen that start of the year. So, the absence of a negative is a positive. So, I think -- that's one piece. And John called out something, I think, that is important, also that balance between what we are seeing on ASO and PEO that seems to kind of come into a little bit more in balance. So, I think those two things bode -- or have started the year well. And... John Gibson : Yeah, no, I'm trying to understand. So, remember, we've got -- you've got existing client behavior, particularly as it relates to attachment, and again, it's always difficult because the insurance it's pass-through, it doesn't have a huge impact on margin as an oversized impact on the revenue numbers right, because is that the way it works. And so you had two dynamics. One was existing customers that have the product, are they continuing to want that attachment? And then, what are they attaching on? Are they attaching the catalog plan or the basic low value plan? That's the first decision. And last year, we had something we normally don't see, and we have not seen thus far through our enrollment of people, as Efrain said, instead of going to a lower plan, dropping and not offering. We're not seeing that behavior, we saw that last year. We saw less people opting to want to add that or seeing value in adding the insurance, but they wanted the HR, and they wanted the technology, and they wanted our advisory services. They went in the ASO buckets. Now we are going back to some of them that are now saying okay wait, now I do want to add the insurance, and now we are upgrading them to the PEO offering. So, what we are seeing is, both in terms of new logo demand, some new net customers to Paychex, we are seeing strong demand in our ASO and PEO market with attachment rates in the PEO similar to what we saw prior to the '23 experience. And then, the third thing that we've got going on is we are going back into this ASO group of clients that we were -- last year, and we are going back and using analytics and using value propositions to see if we can go back and have some of those clients upgrade and add insurance as part of their value proposition. I hope that answers your question. I wasn't clear, James... James Faucette : That's actually really helpful. And I guess just as -- so it sounds like for most of your employers in terms of their behavior on particularly some of those offerings is that they're kind of reverting back to what you would expect to be in a normalized environment, and really it was last year that was really atypical. John Gibson : Yes, that's what I would say it. Again, you just make stuff out. I was just trying to remember two years ago was the great resignation. Last year this time, the bottom was going to fall out of the economy and all is the recession was right around the corner. They are going to recall that. I mean, it's just -- it's been a very emotional roller coaster ride for small and medium-sized businesses. And when they're making a decision of this magnitude because you're making a commitment to your employees that you're going to offer a benefit and the expectation is you're baking that into your business model going forward. And so, I think there was a lot of hesitancy. Now, does that mean small, medium-sized businesses are more confident today than they were last year? I don't know, but what I can tell you is we are seeing more behavior that is similar to what we've seen in historical patterns. And last year, it seemed to be an anomaly. Again, I'm only 25% through the enrollment, but what I'm seeing right now we'll know more in the next call. Let's leave it at that. James Faucette : Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you, guys. Efrain Rivera : Appreciate it. John Gibson : Okay. Shelby, I think that wraps it up. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call that will be archived for approximately 90 days. Again, that's on the Paychex Investor website, where we also have all these fabulous reports for you to read. And again, we want to thank you for your interest in Paychex and hope everyone has a great day. Operator : That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

Later, you will have an opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this call is being recorded, and that I will be standing by should you need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to John Gibson. John Gibson : Thanks, Chelsea. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings release. Joining me today is Bob Schrader, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I'm going to start today with a brief update on the business highlights for the second quarter, and then I'll turn it over to Bob for a financial update, and then, of course, we'll take your questions. We had solid results in the second quarter and for the first half of the fiscal year with particularly strong performance in the PEO, mid-market HCM, and retirement. Revenue for the first half was up 6% year-over-year and our adjusted diluted earnings per share was up 10%, double digits. The demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions remained strong as business leaders continue to face a very challenging small and mid-sized business environment. The tight labor market and rising healthcare and benefits costs are forcing many to rethink their HR and benefit strategies, and they can turn to Paychex as a trusted business partner in these times. As we sit here today, the selling season for our mid-market HCM and our PEO teams are in their final phases, and our insurance open enrollment is underway. All are going well and in-line with our expectations. Our pipelines for these solutions are strong and up from this time last year. In the small business market, selling season is just ramping up. We still have a critical third quarter to go both in terms of selling and delivering for our clients during year-end, but we are fully staffed and well positioned at this critical time of year. Our revenue retention remains above pre-pandemic levels as we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high value clients. Client retention has improved over last year and retention in our HR outsourcing solutions remains at record levels. I'd like to highlight the success specifically in our PEO business, which we've talked about on prior calls. It has continued to gain momentum with strong results during the first half of the fiscal year. We have seen a back -- a shift back towards the PEO offering, both outside and inside our client base. This shift in mix has a long-term positive impact on customer lifetime value in our business model, particularly as clients attach insurance benefits. We previously discussed actions we took to help the PEO recover after last year's challenges including : one, redesigning our health offerings; second, leveraging AI to revamp our sales and marketing models and to identify and attract high-value prospects; three, putting more focus on upgrading existing HCM and ASO clients to the PEO model; and finally, improved sales execution. As mentioned earlier, our insurance enrollment is underway and the tax rates are up after a challenging year last year. I want to specifically thank and congratulate our PEO team for all the hard work and success the past year so far. The macro environment and labor environment continue to be challenging for small and mid-sized businesses. Our Small Business Employment Watch continues to show moderation in both job growth and wage inflation, which is indicative of a stable macro environment and that the actions taken by the Fed are having their desired impact. While we haven't seen any normal signs of a recession in our data, we started to see some softening in seasonal hiring in the quarter, particularly in our large client segments, including our HR outsourcing businesses, many of which typically add seasonal employees at this time of the year. SMBs are still challenged with access to capital, the high cost of capital, inflation and macro uncertainty. While we certainly don't see any signs of economic downturn, we are ready to take the required actions if such trends emerge. As one of the best operators in the business, we have demonstrated that we are able to respond and successfully navigate changes in the -- any economic environment. I know that AI and related technology advancements remain a hot topic in our industry. As I've noted in past calls, AI at Paychex is nothing new. We have over hundreds of and growing models -- AI models that are actively working in our business today, designed to provide valuable insights fueled by our vast data assets. The exciting transformation that is now occurring around generative AI opens up the opportunity for us to bring AI solutions to our employees, so they can be more effective and efficient and to our clients. We are actively investing in GenAI in exploring how it can be used to improve efficiency and the customer experience and provide actual insights to us and our clients to help them succeed. Currently, recently we partnered with Visier, a global leader in people analytics and workforce solutions, to offer new benchmarking reports in AI-powered HR analytics solutions to our customers. This enhances our current reporting and analytics available in Paychex Flex and will perfectly complement our industry-leading HR advisory services. The partnership provides core HR and compensation analytics and compensation in salary benchmarking, an AI-driven model with benchmarks against 750 million market data points. This offering, in addition to our AI-driven Retention Insights Solution that we launched over a year ago, is just the beginning of how we will leverage AI to help businesses succeed. Partnerships with Visier, like our recruiting and onboarding partnership with Indeed, is another example of how Paychex is bringing together the power of partnerships, our large data assets and integration to improve the customer experience and deliver real value and business outcomes for our clients. We are also pleased that for the seventh consecutive year, we have been positioned in the Leader quadrant as part of the NelsonHall's 2023 Vendor Evaluation report for payroll service providers. This provides further evidence of our leadership position based upon our robust technology and customer support. We're also very proud to be recognized in the Sapient Insights Group Voice of the Customer Top Five Vendor Survey for 2023 and 2024, receiving top five ratings in six categories spanning payroll, HR, time and attendance, learning and performance. And really what I'm most proud of is that the Sapient report is actually based on actual voices of our customers and customers from across the competitors, which demonstrates our leadership position across the industry. As we head into selling season in calendar year-end, I'm confident in our global Paychex team and that they will constantly deliver and consistently deliver for our clients. We remain driven to be the trusted partner for small and mid-sized businesses that deliver industry leading HCM technology and advisory solutions that help our clients succeed. I'll now turn it over to Bob to give you a brief update on our financial results in the quarter. Bob? Bob Schrader : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to remind everyone that today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some level of risks. I'll refer you to our customary disclosures in our press release as well as our Investor Relations presentation that should be on our website. I will start by providing a summary of our second quarter financial results. Total revenue for the quarter increased 6% to $1.3 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 4% to $931 million that was primarily driven by growth in a number of our clients served across our suite of HCM solutions, price realization, an increased product penetration and growth in ancillary services. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 8% to $296 million that was driven primarily by higher revenue per client, including higher insurance revenues and average worksite employees. As John mentioned, our PEO saw continued momentum in sales activity and medical plan purchase volumes during the second quarter. Interest on funds held for clients increased 44% to $31 million that was primarily due to higher average interest rates. Total expenses increased 5% to $752 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher compensation costs, PEO direct insurance costs and continued investments in sales, marketing and technology. Operating income increased 7% to $506 million for the quarter, with an operating margin of 40.2%, that's a 50 basis point expansion over the prior-year period. And both diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $1.08 per share. I will now quickly touch on the results for the first six months of the year. Total revenue grew 6% to $2.5 billion. Management Solutions revenue in the first half of the year increased 5% to $1.9 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions was up 7% to $593 million. And interest on funds held for clients increased 62% to $64 million. Our total expenses for the first half of the year were up 5% to $1.5 billion. And our operating margins for this first six months were 41%, and that was a 60 basis point improvement over the prior year. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 10% to $2.24 and $2.23, respectively. I'll take you through a quick overview of the company's financial position. As you all know, we maintain a strong financial position with high quality cash flows and earnings. Our balance for cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments was more than $1.4 billion and our total borrowings were approximately $812 million as of the end of November. Cash flow for operations for the six -- first six months of the year were $1 billion, and that's up 40% compared to the same period last year. This was primarily driven by higher net income and fluctuations in working capital. Do want to call out, similar to last quarter, there were some timing differences there based on where the quarter ended, ended on a collection day, that's having higher operating cash flows, that's why you see the 40% level. That will moderate as we move through the year. We returned a total of $811 million to shareholders during the first six months that includes $642 million of dividends and $169 million of share repurchases. And our 12-month rolling return on equity remains strong at 47%. I'll now turn to our guidance for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024. We've raised guidance on certain measures based on performance this past quarter. For other measures, I will also provide some color on where we now expect to be within the ranges and certainly we can provide some more detail when we get into the Q&A. The outlook assumes the current macro and competitive environment, which had some uncertainty, particularly as it relates to future interest rate changes in the economy. So, our current outlook is as follows : Management Solutions is unchanged with growth in the range of 5% to 6%, although we do anticipate it will now be at the low end of the range. PEO and Insurance Solutions is now expected to grow in the range of 7% to 9%, that's up from our previous guidance, which was 6% to 9% expectation. Interest on funds held for clients is not changed. We still expect that to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 7%, but we now expect it to be more in the middle of the range. I know last quarter, we thought that might be a bit stronger. We now expect the total revenue guidance to be more aligned with our original guidance of 6% to 7%. Operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%. Although we now anticipate that will probably be toward the upper end of that range. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $35 million to $40 million, and that's raised from our previous guidance of $30 million to $35 million. No change to the effective income tax rate. We still expect that to be between 24% and 25%. And then, adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow in the range of 10% to 11%. So, we raised that last quarter to 9% to 11% just based on what we're seeing. We expect that to be a bit stronger and we're raising that guidance to 10% to 11%. Now, I'm going to turn to the third quarter to give you a little color on the third quarter. We are currently anticipating total revenue growth for the third quarter to be in the range of 5% to 6%, and operating margins to be in the range of 44% to 45%. As it stands right now, we would expect to pretty much be in the middle of those two ranges. And I'd like to remind everyone that we've talked about this in the past that ERTC becomes a headwind in the back half of the year. If I go back and look over the last two-and-a-half years that we've been selling ERTC, Q3 of last year was the largest quarter that we had with ERTC. And so that's a bit more of a headwind in Q3 than Q4, but will be a headwind in the back half of the year. Of course, all of this is based on our current assumptions, which are subject to change. We'll come back and update you again on the third quarter call. As I mentioned, our investor slides are posted on the website, so I'll refer you there for additional information. And with that, I will turn it back over to John. John Gibson : Okay. Thank you, Bob. We will now open it up -- the call for questions. Chelsea? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Kevin McVeigh with UBS. Kevin McVeigh : Thanks you so much, and congratulations as you close out the year, John, Bob, and I want to thank Efrain, because I think this is the last quarter Efrain will be on the call too. So, John or Bob, I think you talked about revenue retention at record levels and client retention improving. Can you maybe dimensionalize that a little bit? And -- because it feels like that's getting a little bit better, but the revenue maybe more the middle of the range. So, what's driving the improvement, and then, kind of maybe just the tweak on the revenue expectations overall? John Gibson : Yeah. Kevin, I'll start off on retention and we can talk a little bit about the revenue expectations. Bob will add some color on that, then I'll jump in. Look, we continue to be very pleased with where we are on revenue retention. I think as we continually talked about, we've really been highly focused on having an impact in those critical areas where it counts and that's our high-value segments and that's what we've seen. Our HR outsourcing business, both ASO and PEO, record levels of retention. And we're very pleased with that. Client retention across the business was actually better in the first half of this fiscal year than it was last fiscal year. And that's really attributable to the team's great job of really managing the controllables. We're continuing to see on the lower end of the market, bankruptcies out of businesses and non-controllable losses being higher year-over-year. That's not surprising to me when you see the level of business starts that we've seen during the COVID period really at elevated levels. And we just know, out of those small companies that started out two years ago, most of those have trouble financially. And so, overall revenue retention continues to be at pre-pandemic levels, which I would remind you was at near historic highs for the company. Bob Schrader : Yeah, Kevin, I'll just add on the guide. As you guys remember, at the end of Q1, I think where we ended the quarter, we had said we expected to be towards the high end of the range. I think there were a couple of reasons at that time why we felt confident in saying that. I would say, one, the positive trends that we were seeing in the PEO business. I think we wanted to wait another quarter before we raised the PEO guidance. But we definitely saw some positive trends really going back to the end of last year. That continued into Q1. I'd say that gave us a little bit of confidence. And as you guys know, we did do a small acquisition at the end of Q1, not a big contributor to growth. But I think those two things combined really gave us a bit of confidence that we thought we might be towards the upper end of the range, I'd say, as we got through Q2. The one thing that I'll highlight, I think John made reference to it, although we didn't have big growth assumptions in the plan related to employment growth, particularly in our larger employee sizes across both Management Solutions and the PEO. We typically get some seasonal hiring. We expected to see some growth there that didn't materialize to the level that we expected and certainly what we've seen in the past. And so that's given us a little bit of pause. And as I mentioned, that was across both categories, Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance. The PEO and Insurance, for the most part, they've been able to outrun that I would say, just given the strength of the business. John talked about the strong demand there. And some of the action plans that we've taken have really paid off there. But on the Management Solutions side, it's been a little bit of a headwind. And that is kind of what you see in the quarter as well as kind of the fine-tuning of the guidance ranges that I just provided. Kevin McVeigh : Very helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my question. Really strong quarter on the PEO front. I wanted to ask about pricing dynamics there. And in health insurance, more specifically, we've heard from some competitors within the space that there are certain players that are being more aggressive on the health side during this year's renewal cycle. I'm just kind of wondering if you've seen that. How Paychex is navigating that environment stacking up in terms of rate increases relative to those peers and maybe just how you're faring broadly on the pricing side? John Gibson : Yeah. So, thanks for the question, Andrew. I'll say this, the PEO, you can tell by the growth numbers, continued to improve as the year has gone on. And I would tell you that our pipeline is very strong in comparison to last year. So, whatever the competitors are doing, our value proposition is resonating. I can assure you that we're not using cheap health as that part of the value proposition. So, we go at it more as a comprehensive HR outsourcing value proposition. And if clients are looking for cheap health, they're probably -- we're probably not engaging in that conversation very long. We have the capability, as you know, to also leverage our insurance agency within our PEO as well. But very pleased with where we are on -- with the PEO right now, very strong performance. The pipeline is solid. We are in the final stages. As you can imagine. That in the mid-market, as you know, typically the selling season is much earlier, it's pretty much in the final innings. And both pipelines, I would say, for the PEO are very, very strong, both in terms of insurance attachment and in terms of sales. Andrew Nicholas : Great. And if you don't mind, just a follow-up on ERTC. It sounds like that's trending towards your expectation that the comp in the fiscal third quarter is a bit tougher. I just wanted to confirm that. And then also, it looks like the IRS has taken a stance with respect to ERTC and potentially making PEOs liable for that. Just wondering if that presents any risk or how you are kind of thinking about that dynamic in that part of the business. Thank you. Bob Schrader : I'll start on just kind of the financials. I'd say for the most part, ERTC, we finally got it right from a forecasting standpoint after three years. It's bit been a little challenging to forecast that. But for the most part, it has lined up with our expectations. Most of that was assumed to be in the front half of the year. That's behind us. There still is a little bit in the back half of the year. But for the most part, it has lined up. I've gotten this question a lot. I promise to provide an update on ERTC. So, I'm going to stick to my word, which was essentially we had said prior that we expected it to be a slight tailwind in the front half of the year. That's where the front half landed, it was a slight tailwind. We expected it to be a headwind in the back half of the year. It will be a headwind in the back half of the year. But I wanted to provide a little bit more color and you guys can kind of do the math and back into it. But on a full-year basis, with the tailwind in the front half and the headwind in the back half, we would expect it to be about a 1% headwind on a full-year basis to growth. And then, I don't know if, John, you want to address the PEO? John Gibson : Yeah. I think relative to your question on the PEO and ERTC and the IRS stance on it, I would say, the IRS has been trying to look for bad actors in both parts of that equation and tighten rules. As you can imagine, we've been very diligent with our compliance teams in setting up our process. In fact, we were a little slower going out on ERTC products in the PEO because we wanted to work through all of those compliances and the way we approach the contracting with our clients for those services. So, I would tell you, Andrew, we feel very good about our position of where we are in terms of managing that risk. Andrew Nicholas : Perfect. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. I had a follow-up on ERTC. It strikes me that there is a kind of a backlog building, right, as they've paused processing. So, is this the type of thing that we should think about, yes, it's a headwind in the back half of the year, but eventually as the IRS begins processing again that revenue might start to flow again in the future? Is it sort of more of a shift of revenue into the future? And I know it's complicated and they're rolling in some deadlines in '24 -- calendar '24. So, I'm just curious how we should -- how you're thinking about that ERTC revenue, not just for the following quarters, but maybe a little bit beyond that. Bob Schrader : Yeah, not really, Ramsey, because what we're basically doing is we're amending the returns and filing the submissions for our clients which the IRS continues to accept. And so, we're recognizing the revenue as we do that and they're still accepting submission. So, there's really not a timing shift there. The change at the IRS made at the end of Q1 really hasn't impacted our ability to continue to go into our base and sell it, really hasn't impacted our forecast from a revenue standpoint. The big difference is that you have the deadline, you are approaching a deadline here at the end of this fiscal year. And we're three years into it and we've been through our base and really have identified all the clients that qualify for the opportunity. We've talked to them. And if we haven't talked to them, you can turn on the radio, everyone else has talked to them. So it just, hey, we're through eight years into it. I think most small businesses that were qualified for this benefit have taken advantage of the opportunity. And there may be some a little bit flows into next year, but nothing of significance. I'm hoping at some point in time, I can stop talking about ERTC, but there's really no timing shift there related to what the IRS did. Ramsey El-Assal: Great. That's very helpful. And a quick follow-up. SECURE Act 2.0, is that in any of your conversations in the selling season? Give us kind of your latest view about how that opportunity is framing up for Paychex? John Gibson : Yeah. I think we highlighted and mentioned, in first half, 401(k), a very solid continued performance. So, we're very pleased with that offering. I think as you know, we probably go out to the market with the most comprehensive retirement offerings for small businesses, anywhere from simple IRAs to our SEP plan that we are one of the largest providers, if not the largest provider of PEP plans. So, very pleased with that. It is part of our selling season campaigns. I think as I said, one of the things we've learned a lot about the retirement business from some of the state mandates, I continue to try to pound this in is this is one of the things you still have a lot of education to do for the small business owner. Even though there are a lot of benefits to it, there are costs involved, there's compliance issues. So, this is not something that people just sign up for. So, there's a lot of education and pre-marketing that has to be done, but we're certainly leveraging the SECURE Act as a means to entice clients into a conversation, and are finding it successful once we do in getting them to understand the benefits of our offerings. Ramsey El-Assal: Got it. All right, thank you so much. Happy holidays, by the way. John Gibson : Happy Holidays. Bob Schrader : Same to you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Bryan Bergin : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thank you. So, I wanted to start on Management Solutions. The late seasonal hiring that you've called out here that drives the weaker view, can you just dig in more on that client profile? And is this more so a pullback in demand for employees or issues in hiring? So, I'm curious what you might be seeing as it relates to clients' talent acquisition funnels, job openings, background checks, things like that. John Gibson : Yeah, Bryan, it's a good -- that's a very good question, very insightful question, because we're trying to get under that as well. Here's what I will tell you. It is a very challenging environment for small and mid-sized businesses. I think they are still challenged and we're seeing it in our HR advising, they're still challenged with a very challenging labor market in terms of finding qualified workers, I'll always leave it at that. So, I think that's certainly part of the issue. I think there -- certainly with the high cost to capital, also with lower access to capital, I think they're being very cautious about investing for growth. So, they're trying to figure out how do I do more for less. So, there may be a little bit of a hesitancy. At the time -- at the same time, what we hear are people want to hire qualified people. And I think they had some experience with that. There was a small group that I was talking to where what they found was they were paying higher rates for less qualified people. And then, our HR matters that we were dealing with disciplinary issues, no shows, all of these types of issues, I think a lot of business owners are saying, \"If I can't hire a qualified person, I may be better off to try to figure out how I can use to people I have to get there.\" So, I just -- I read that as the macro environment, because we're not seeing anything in our data that would say mass downsizings or reductions. That's not what we're seeing. I think in the higher-end enterprise side, you are seeing rightsizing going on in the business. When you get into the mid-market, really what we're seeing is a little more choppiness in hiring across various industries, and particularly it's mostly up-market and what I would say what we've typically seen seasonal hiring, that's where we did not see that at the rates that we historically have seen. Now what's interesting about that I'll point out is when you see -- when I see the impressive results of our PEO team, remember a lot of PEO clients are in Florida, which, as you can imagine, is a pretty seasonal state this time of year. So, the growth numbers you're seeing there were with a headwind of not having as much seasonal hiring. We saw a similar thing in our ASO business, which is in Managed Solutions, and to a lesser extent in our HCM mid-market business. So, I would say more choppiness there. In the small market, it's more of the same moderation that you see in our index, really not what I'd say downsizing or clients taking actions from an employment perspective. But more of either they can't find people to fill the spots they want or they are being hesitant on adding additional headcount at this time. So, I don't know if that gives you some additional color. Bob Schrader : Hey, Bryan. I just want to add a little bit. You didn't specifically ask this, but just as your comment as it relates to the weaker Management Solutions. The other part of that -- beyond the softer hiring versus what we expected, the other part of part of that has to do with the strong performance in PEO as well. We talked to you guys about the PEO business. We've had a lot of questions on that and our ability to kind of reaccelerate growth there. And one of the strategies there was that we knew the ASO was really strong last year. We had put a plan together to really go back inside of the base, leverage our data, leverage our AI models, really look at the clients that we thought would be good PEO fits, and we've been executing on that plan over the last six months and that has actually been a little bit better than what we anticipated. So, now the pendulum has swung back a little bit the other way. We probably should just put these two businesses together in one category. It would make mine and John's job much easier. But we've had a lot of success with PEO. I think that's why you see the raise there. And that is impacting to some extent, to use your word, the little bit weaker performance in Management Solutions. Bryan Bergin : Okay. That's all helpful color. And I fully understand the ASO versus kind of PEO shift there. And maybe just a follow-up here on the PEO, can you just dig in a bit more around the expectations of at-risk health insurance attachment participation rates as you go towards the 1/1 go-live period? And specifically, did PEO bookings accelerate in the quarter relative to last quarter? John Gibson : Well, let me take the last one first. Yes, I would tell you that we talked about the PEO in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year. We told you about many of the changes we were making across that business. We began to see acceleration there. It accelerated further in the first quarter, and it continued in the second quarter. And it continued both outside the base as well as inside the base. So, as Bob pointed out, this ASO to PEO conversion. So, we've seen a very healthy pipeline. And I would say not only in the PEO, also in our mid-market. So, when you look at the two businesses, that are -- in summary, if you -- if we're sitting here today in the selling season in our mid-market HCM and PEO, they're well underway. They're really in the final stages. Our pipeline was very strong. And then, the enrollment of the insurance, it was very strong as well. I would tell you that we're getting back in line to where we've been historically. If you remember, we had a little degradation. And actually, what we saw inside the existing customer base was an increase, I would say, maybe single-digit increase in penetration. If you remember, last year, we had some employees in it sign up for plans. We did some things on changing our plan lineup. We did some things in the way we're doing education and open enrollment there. And the team has done a great job of improving our attach rate within the existing client base as well during this enrollment. Bryan Bergin : All right, thank you. Happy holidays. John Gibson : Happy holidays. Bob Schrader : Same to you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask a follow-up just on Management Solutions. I mean, I know we're talking about the lower end of the 5% to 6% for the year. So, you basically need to maintain the 5% growth rate that you saw in the first half, in the second half, despite the fact you're lapping ERTC, and it sounds like maybe the tone on overall health of SMBs is down-ticking a little bit. So, just wanted to get your perspective on the visibility of Paychex's ability to maintain that 5% growth in the second half given some of those moving parts out there? Thank you. Bob Schrader : Yeah. I mean, I can start and then John can add on. I mean, obviously, there is the headwind there with ERTC, but there's other areas of the business. And although ASO, we had some of the hiring challenges that John referenced as well as better PEO performance, ASO still continues to be a strong contributor to growth, and we expect that to continue to be the case in the back half of the year. We talked about retirement. That has been a really strong driver of growth for us and just really increased product penetration. We expect that to continue into the back half of the year, Jason. That will offset, to some extent, some of the ERTC headwind. And again, we did do a small acquisition. It's not a huge contributor to growth on a full-year basis. But again, that will help mitigate some of that headwind as we move into the back half of the year. And when we kind of put all those things together, we would expect Management Solutions to be in a similar growth rate in the back half of the year than the first half -- or same as the first half. John Gibson : Yeah. Jason, I just think the other thing I would add on commentary, relative to the SMB market, we're not even in really the key selling season. So, we're just in the selling season. That's just beginning to kick off, and we have a lot of execution during January, as you know, to go out in the marketplace. So that's just starting. So, the areas where we are nearly complete with the selling season, the mid-market, the PEO, the high end of ASO, those pipelines are full, much better than last year. And really in that small market, we're just beginning to enter the selling season with a lot of execution to go in the next 60 days. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. That's good color. I know you talked about how you're thinking about overall revenue growth for Q3 versus Q4, but can you just parse out maybe your segment level growth expectations for Q3 versus Q4, just so we get our models tuned properly? Thank you, guys. Have a great holiday. John Gibson : Thanks, Jason. Happy holidays. Bob Schrader : Yeah, I'm just -- I'm taking a look at that, Jason. Obviously, the Management Solutions will probably be a bit lower in Q3 than Q4 because of the headwinds that we talked about being greater with ERTC in Q3. And then, the PEO and Insurance, those growth rates are going to be similar to where they were in Q2. And hopefully, when you look at the full-year guidance, the guide that I gave you on Q3, you can kind of do the math and should get you close. John Gibson : Yeah. The other thing, Jason, I just think, again, on color of this -- Bob said that this geography shifting that we have going over last year counter rotated the ASO from the PEO offering when we're offering both, there's more movement that way. So, we're talking geography. Now, we're talking the geography move from Management Solutions to PEO and Insurance, because it's tilted kind of the other way. The other thing that I would remind everybody, which is a little different on the ASO to PEO conversions, there's not a selling season for that. We do those migrations all year long. And so, we continue to see good traction there, and we don't intend to slow that down. There's no reason to. It's higher revenue, it's a higher lifetime value in our overall model. So again, just relative to forecasting between the two areas as well doing -- Bob's got a model, he'll go through it with you. But the caveat I always have that I'll say that geography thing is if we can continue to move more of our clients from HCM and ASO to PEO in the back half of the year, we'll do that. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Peter Christiansen with Citi. Peter Christiansen : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Nice execution here. John, Bob, I was just hoping if you could talk a little bit about balance of trade. Any trends that you're noticing, particularly in the Management Solutions area? And then -- and John, you also mentioned AI playing a part in the sales role. Just wondering if you could dig a little bit into that and give us a sense of where you're making headway on that front? Appreciate the commentary. Happy holidays. John Gibson : Yeah, thank you very much. No, look, I think relative to across the platforms in the mid-market, very pleased with the growth we have there. We've talked about the PEO already, very happy with where we are there. As I look across the small business, it's a competitive market. I wouldn't say there's any major changes. And I would say I've talked about on the last call, our balance of trade metrics continue to look solid. I always say we're entering the selling season, and the next 60 days is about -- is all about that, and it's a competitive market. So we'll see. But as we sit here today, the known knowns, very happy with our progress, upmarket in the mid-market HCM, very pleased with where we are on PEO, upper end of the ASO market. And then, as I said, as we sit here today, I'm pleased with our balance of trade in the other areas. There was another question I missed something... Peter Christiansen : On the AI front, I think you mentioned it... John Gibson : Yeah, thanks. I can't believe I passed up an opportunity to talk about AI. Look, AI is -- I will tell you, we've been doing a lot around this for decades. And now it's kind of out there in the public domain, but it's really quite amazing. So, let's talk about on the sales side, we talk about on the PEO side. We're using it in our underwriting. We're using it in our targeting, and we're using it in the mining of our base. The productivity lift that we get in terms of being able to understand where we can add value, you're almost getting to the point where you almost like have a pre-proposal because you almost know the client is going to be -- is going to like what they see. So, we're doing a lot of things there using AI models and our data models there. Doing a lot of this -- we talked a bit about pricing. And one of the things we now have is we have all of our major sales teams on one common platform in terms of proposal, proposal management and pricing management. And we're actually building AI models, started to use that in the mid-market that actually then gives our sales reps in real time based upon numerous factors, what price and what level of discounting we would allow for a particular client based upon the value of the client, based on the competitive set, et cetera. And that's actually allowing us to maximize both volume and rate. And we're going to continue to refine those models and expand those across the teams. But what we're getting from a sales productivity perspective, what we're getting in terms of a marketing targeting perspective, what we're getting in terms of the ability to set the right price and rate to get the biggest competitive advantage, all of those things are pretty impressive. Then on top of that, we're actually using it for analytics. We're actually taking and using voice analytics on the conversations we're having with prospects, and in real time, able to give coaching to our sales teams relative to what phrases are working, what messages are working, and we can dynamically change those things on the fly with our marketing message and sales scripts accordingly. So, just a ton of very interesting things that we're doing. It was interesting as a lot of these changes to our go-to-market, we actually started piloting in the PEO back in the second half of the last quarter when we were having some challenges. We thought that was the best place to start and to see if we could get some lift. And some of what we've seen in the PEO, I think is a direct result of some of these tactics. Peter Christiansen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Hey, good morning, John and Bob. John Gibson : Kartik, good morning. Kartik Mehta : Thanks. John, you talked about -- a little bit about the key selling season, obviously, in the SMB. And I'm wondering if you've seen any kind of change in price competition or if you're seeing anything that is a little different this time than last year? John Gibson : Kartik, look, I don't -- look, it's a competitive market, and it has been as long as I've been in the industry, 27 years. So look, I think there's all kinds of tricks. There's all kinds of marketing [indiscernible] using them. The fact of the matter is I think there's a lot of offers out there when you get under the details of how long you have to be there, what are the strings attached. Really what it is, it's basic. It's the same kind of environment in terms of discounting. It is very aggressive. But I would say this. I mean, look, we continue to see that we have price value and pricing pressure -- pricing power, both within our base and in the market. And that was very high in the last two years. I think we have been very able with the PPP and the ERTC to be able to really command very strong pricing power. That being said, we've done it for decades. I mean, we're not the lowest cost provider out there, and haven't been for decades. And I think what you see is when you look at our retention levels with our existing clients at record highs, I think that says something about the value proposition. At the end of the day, I think small, medium-sized business owners buy on value, not necessarily on price. So, we're going to be competitive. We're going to meet people where they are head to head, but we're not going to be stupid. And you can see that we're being competitive, we're winning where we've been in combat in the market. We've got a good pipeline and a good track record of success. And as you can tell from our margins, we're not giving away the store. Kartik Mehta : And then, Bob, just on the Management Solutions and you're talking about the seasonal employees, is that just -- if we kind of consolidate all that, is it just a matter of your pays per control expectations were X, but they came in a little bit less because of what you're seeing? Bob Schrader : Yeah. I'd say it's more than that, Kartik, because as we've talked about, on a full-year basis, we had some moderate expectations for clients adding employees. It wasn't a big driver of growth overall, as I mentioned, across both Management Solutions and PEO, that was a little bit softer. But what we're really seeing is not on the low end of the market. It's with our larger size clients, particularly in those ASO and PEO models. They're bigger client sizes, and we typically get some seasonal hiring. We get it every year. We had some assumptions around what that would look like in Q2, and that hasn't materialized to the level of our assumption or what we've seen in prior years. So, it's really -- it is across the board. It's a little bit softer than what we anticipated. But to John's point earlier, it's not that small businesses are getting rid of employees, they're just not adding to the level that we assumed in the plan. Kartik Mehta : Thank you both. Appreciate it. Bob Schrader : You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Samad Samana : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just stepping back, since the last time you guys reported, the company put out midterm financial goals. And I was wondering if maybe you could just provide us some context on the assumptions in that upper single-digit growth target for revenue, just especially as we think about employment maybe peaking and rates doing what they are. Just what was in that assumption, especially given that it was put out there between the last time you guys reported and now? Just maybe help us understand what the building blocks are? Bob Schrader : Yeah -- oh, you want me to take it? John Gibson : No, go ahead. Go ahead. Bob Schrader : Yeah. Samad, I've gotten this question a lot. I think if you look back at -- and we've talked about this area. I've talked about it with many of you on this question specifically. But if you look at what we've done from a revenue growth, whether it's over the last five years or 10 years, it's well within the range of that midterm guidance that we gave. I would also say the guidance that we're providing this year, at least the way I think about it, is well within that range as well. And as you know better than anyone, we have a way we go about delivering that growth. It's a mix of client-based growth, and then, I would say that we would assume that to be similar with past performance. One thing that we're really good at is getting a larger share of wallet out of our client base, particularly with our higher value solutions, ASO, PEO, retirement. We still think there's a lot of opportunity inside the base. When you look at a lot of those key solutions, the penetration rates are fairly low. And so, we believe we have a lot of opportunity to continue to drive growth there. As John mentioned, we have pricing power, right? We deliver a strong value proposition and our expectation is that, hey, we might not be capturing price to the level that we did over the last couple of years where inflation was, but we believe we have a strong value proposition that is going to enable us to continue to capture price in the future. And I think when you put all that together -- I'd say the other component of it, when you look back historically, is we have used M&A as a way to drive growth in the business, and that has been part of our growth formula. It's part of what we've delivered over the last five and 10 years, and we expect that we'll continue to look for opportunities, and that will be part of our growth in the future. So, when you kind of put that all together, that gives us confidence that we can continue to deliver in that upper single digit level. It's not going to be -- it'll vary year by year, but for the most part, we expect it to be in that range. Samad Samana : Understood. Thanks for that. And then maybe just a follow-up. Based on the trends that you guys have called out so far or what you observed in this most recent quarter, how should we think that may be your own near-term hiring plans for quota-carrying sales reps or just in your own sales organization, any change to that plan based on what you just observed in the prior quarter? John Gibson : No. We're fully staffed, and our intent is to continue to grow sales. Look, the business starts are up. We feel like the opportunity in the marketplace is strong. Now, I will tell you, the thing we are trying to balance is the productivity gains that we can get out of some of the go-to-market strategies. As I said, we did some testing learns in the PEO that showed some really good lift. And so, quite frankly, I think we're going to apply those in the mid-market and upper end of the SMB market. And I think those could also be a lift as well, but we have no plans of pulling back on investing in growth. Samad Samana : Great. Thank you. Enjoy the holiday season. John Gibson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Hi, guys. Good morning. Just a couple of clarifications from me. When you talked about SMBs investing for growth, hesitation -- some hesitation there. Does that impact their willingness to buy ancillary services and maybe has impacted the management services growth as well? John Gibson : We've really not seen that, Bryan. I think what we see is, it's probably in the case of -- I'll just use an example, let's use an example. You may have a very good business owner has opened a couple of franchises, doing very, very well financially, and probably could justify adding another franchise store somewhere. But the cost of capital, access to capital is constrained, and they're holding back on doing that because the hurdle rate just can't be met. So that's more what I see than people pulling back and saying that I don't need that. Again, most of the time when you look at our products and services that we're offering, they're either driving efficiency or they're helping them retain and attract quality employees, either by enhancing their benefits or by having an HCM solution. So, I kind of view that most of our clients that are looking at our services understand the value of the products and services, and believe that they're actually going to help their business be more successful. And so, I don't think they always view it as an expense line item, if you know what I mean. Bryan Keane : Got it. And then, the other clarification I had is, the shift to ASO the PEO, did that surprise you guys or was that all part of the plan and pretty typical? John Gibson : No, I mean, it's something we've always historically done. What I would say is that it turned out better than we expected. Now, let's keep in mind, last year when we're out in the market with the PEO and ASO offering, we saw a tilt towards -- we had great HR outsourcing sales last year, we have great HR outsourcing sales this year. They're just in different locations on the reporting structure. And so, last year, we knew we had a lot of clients that we would have typically seen be great candidates for PEO and they, for whatever reason, went to the ASO offering. And we said in the calls, we felt like that would be a good opportunity to go back to them once they've experienced our human capital management system, the benefits of our HR advisory solutions and our HRGs to go back and kind of reintroduce them to the comprehensive outsourcing of the PEO model. That's exactly what we did. And so, we had a bigger group of clients inside the base because of the success of ASO last year to go in mind. And then, the other point that I said, what we're doing in terms of analytics to be able to identify clients that we have a high degree of certainty that they're going to benefit from the co-employment relationship that a PEO provides, and that's enabling us to what I would say a little bit better cherry-pick inside our vast customer base, who we should go after. Bryan Keane : Got it. That's helpful. And then, just a quick one for Bob. Just to quantify the small acquisition, does that add about 1 point to 2 points of revenue for third quarter or how do we think about that? Bob Schrader : No, it's small. I don't have the exact number, Bryan, On a full year basis, we said it's not a material contributor to revenue growth at all. I mean, way less than 1%. I don't have the split in front of me by quarter. Bryan Keane : Yeah, I was just thinking maybe it could offset some of the ETRC... Bob Schrader : Yeah, I mean, it certainly is, and that's assumed in the guide, and it certainly is offsetting it, but ERTC was so large in the back half of last year, particularly in Q3, and unfortunately, it comes nowhere near close enough to offset the full thing, but it does minimize it a little bit, the headwind. Bryan Keane : Great. Happy holidays. Bob Schrader : Yeah, same to you. John Gibson : Happy holidays. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Great. Good morning, guys. Just a couple of quick follow-up questions. In terms of back to this point on seasonal hiring, maybe being a little bit weaker, I'm just wondering from your perspective if there's been any impact or truth even before now to this narrative that we've heard a lot around labor hoarding and that smaller businesses in particular were keeping people on payroll or employed that they maybe otherwise wouldn't have just because they were concerned about shortages. And just wondering if you'd seen any evidence of that actually in your customers and if that could be impacting the seasonal hiring at all. John Gibson : Well, James. I actually would say in the small business, it's not been hoarding at all. It's been a deficit. Now, to be fair, in our index, which we follow very closely, and I've reported a lot on this, small businesses probably nine months ago kind of got back to a level playing field. I think where you saw hoarding was more in the upper end and enterprise side of the space. I think you saw that. Now -- so that's where I think you saw hoarding and hiring of people maybe they didn't even need. And these stats where you've seen in some of these bigger downsizing. I think to the point you may be making is I do think that small and mid-sized business owners were reluctant to change employees out because they were trying a lot of focus on retention. That's why we relaunched the Retention Insights AI offering over a year ago because small business owners want to keep their good employees. I do think now that small business owners are trying to make sure that they have high quality workforces. And that's what we see them talking to our HR generalists about is really more about how do I lead and feed my employee base? I maybe don't have the employee base that I wanted because I was kind of forced to hire some people two years ago when it was hard to find people. Now there's more opportunity to upskill my workforce. That's kind of what we're seeing in the slow and I wouldn't say any hoarding. James Faucette : Okay, got it. I just wanted to make sure that I was interpreting that correctly. Thank you. And then, you mentioned that we still are in a period of strong business starts. What about on the other end? I think there had been this view over -- in the economy generally that we weren't seeing failure rates or out of business rates get back to pre-pandemic levels yet. But can you just give us an update on what kind of out of business levels we're seeing? And how much -- and particularly in the context of continued strong business stores, I'm just wondering on that component of the customer set. John Gibson : Yeah, I would tell you that bankruptcies are up, and have been on the rise probably over the last year. You're still seeing births outpacing deaths. Now, deaths typically report a little lag. I would just tell you in our data that bankruptcies continue to accelerate this year over last year in terms of out of business reasons. Again, what I always want to warn people here because I think people read into that data, other concerns on a macro basis, I don't view it that way. The fact of the matter is we had such high levels of new business burst two years ago during the pandemic that if you just do the math of survivability rates of those businesses that most of them are gone after five years and 50% of them are gone in the first two years. So, what you're seeing is that shedding of that big bulk that started two years ago, the first group of those are going out of business. So, I think it's not a sign that there's an abnormal level of bankruptcies given the level of business starts that we had over the last three years, if that makes sense. Did I say that properly? James Faucette : It does. Yeah, I just -- on that point, so clearly bankruptcies have been rising, but have they -- in your customer sets, have they surpassed pre-COVID levels or not yet? Or -- and it sounds like, given that large number of bursts, we probably should expect them to surpass pre-COVID levels at some point if they haven't, right? John Gibson : Yeah, I would -- let me get right here, because -- what I would tell you is bankruptcies are definitely up and have surpassed the fiscal year '20 levels, which is just... James Faucette : Got it. John Gibson : ...[first year] (ph) of the pandemic. And just passed that mark in the second quarter. James Faucette : Okay. Fantastic. Thank you so much for that. John Gibson : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Mark Marcon with Baird. Mark Marcon : Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. So, on Management Solutions, John and Bob, you started off by talking about the upper -- the mid and upper end being a little bit stronger and seeing good performance there. I'm wondering to what extent is that being driven by some of the new tools that you've recently introduced? In other words -- and what are you seeing just in terms of the strength dissecting between new logos versus further upsells into the existing client base? Bob Schrader : Yeah, I mean, as John mentioned, I think we've seen a lot of strength in the mid-market. And from a sales performance standpoint, our unit performance that we had in Q2, I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks, John, was above where we were at this time last year. We continue to see strong penetration within the existing client base, upsells into the base, whether that's ASO, PEO, retirement, but I would say, Mark, there's strength across the board, both from a new logo standpoint, particularly in the mid-market as well as upsells into the base. Mark Marcon : Great. And then, despite that strong growth, we're basically assuming a slightly slower pace with -- so it basically would be the [SBS] (ph) side, and you've mentioned an increase in terms of bankruptcies. In terms of the selling season, are there any things that you're seeing in terms of differences between Paychex versus SurePayroll? Any sort of differences? And I know it's still early in the selling season, but any color that you would provide above and beyond what you've already said? John Gibson : Yeah, Mark, I would say what we're seeing is what we've typically seen, again, SurePayroll more in the micro set. So, if I look at the micro set, continuing to see similar type of -- there's a lot of new business starts. So, there's a lot of opportunity there for growth. And then, in the small business, we're just so early in the key selling season. Really as you know, the next 60 days are really going to tell us how that's going to shake out. Back to I think what your original question was as well on Management Solutions is, remember, you have the geography issue occurring at the same time. So, while we're selling a lot more inside our human capital management base and into our ASO base, some of what we're upselling is PEO. And so, they're moving over to the other geography on the P&L, which is a good thing from a long-term perspective. And then, as we said, this issue relative to the seasonal hiring, which happened in the upper end of the market, that impacted both the PEO on the PEO and Insurance side and the ASO market on the Management Solution side. Mark Marcon : That's a great point. And then, on the PEO side, just one question with regards to the insurance costs. On an apples-for-apples basis, what sort of price increase are you seeing for similar plans relative to what was offered last year through your various health insurance partners for this coming enrollment season? John Gibson : Yeah, look, you're pointing to an item which I think is a tailwind that I think will continue to evolve, and that is healthcare inflation. And really, I think you'll see that evolve in the future post-pandemic. Pushing costs through the health system is a slow process. It starts with more expenses at the hospital. They have to negotiate with carriers. They have contracts that takes years to do. In our local community, there's unionization and strikes going on at the local hospital for more pay. Then that has to get approved by state legislature. So, the cost increase that we saw inflationary in healthcare last two years is going to start making its way to health plan costs in the future. We're certainly aware of that, and we're doing things to prepare for that. And when we talked about that last year, we did a lot of changes in our healthcare lineups to give more choices to people, making sure that we have the right plans. And I would say that our apples-to-apples was actually highly competitive to what the general inflation was, and we're keeping our MLRs in-line to where they've historically been at the same time. And so, through some plan designs and some other ways in which our teams have been creative in coming up with some creative health solutions, I think we've got a good portfolio of products and services that our clients are finding very competitive to alternatives that they have. I don't know if that helps. Mark Marcon : It does. But would you say, John, that you would be looking at increases for this year in terms of -- would they be higher than last year? And then, what sort of impact does that have? Does it make your PEO offering more or less attractive relative to everything else that's out there as a small business owner that's trying to manage through that situation? John Gibson : Well, I would say given the results and the pipeline that I see, that's made us more successful. That's the results I look at. We're not in a -- we're in a very competitive environment. So, most of the deals that we're involved in, someone else is involved in. And I think our lineup is very comparable. I think what you would -- what I would say is that we manage our plans in such a way that we tend to beat the standard health inflation and we've broadened our portfolio of offerings such that I think there is something for every client. They can find something that they want in our plans. And I think that breadth of services and breadth of options is one of the things that differentiates us from others. Mark Marcon : Great. Thank you, and happy holidays. John Gibson : Happy holidays. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Scott Wurtzel : Hey, good morning, guys. Just one from me quickly. Can you remind us of what your top end market exposures are by vertical, maybe in the PEO segment? We have heard from one of your peers who is seeing some challenges sort of on the pays per control worksite employee side in PEO mostly due to some certain end market exposures. So, it would be very helpful if you guys can just remind us of where you guys have some of your larger exposures in the PEO. Thanks. John Gibson : Scott, we do not have any high concentrations in our PEO. It's the general market. Remember, historically, our PEO was really an upsell within our client base, our payroll client base. Our payroll client base is diverse as the country's small business market. We didn't originate in a vertical strategy as a business from PEO perspective, so we never got highly concentrated in any particular area. We maybe had some geographic concentration before the acquisition of the Oasis, but the Oasis acquisition really made us a broad national player. And so, there's no one industry concentration that really drives that business. Scott Wurtzel : Great. That's super helpful. Thanks, guys. John Gibson : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. David Paige : Hi, good morning. This is David on -- David Paige on for Ashish. I just had a quick one regarding the organic growth in Management Solutions in the quarter. It looks like you grew revenue by 4%, but maybe you could just -- if you could remind us what the organic growth is? It looks like you had a small $200 million acquisition. So that would be helpful. Bob Schrader : Yeah, I mean, that was a very small contributor, David, to growth in the quarter. And the other thing you need to keep in mind, we kind of gave you color on ERTC being a slight tailwind in the first half. It was actually a headwind in Q2, so most of that came in Q1. So, you kind of -- you have the headwind of ERTC. You have a slight tailwind from the acquisition. But the organic growth rate is not going to be too far different from what you see as reported. David Paige : Okay, great. Thank you. Happy holiday. Bob Schrader : Yeah, same to you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Hey, thanks. Yeah, just to close out the call, John, you mentioned the LTV for the PEO business being attractive. I don't think I've heard that from Paychex all these years. So, can you elaborate on that relative to the ASO or HRO or even if you can't size it, just the ratio there? Just love to learn more on that. Bob Schrader : Yeah, I mean we've talked about it in the past that certainly when we look across all the different solutions that we offer, the PEO is certainly the highest lifetime value. And as you can imagine, when you start getting all of the -- you get into that PEO model and they have -- the client has their health insurance and their workers' comp insurance and their SUI with us and all the different offerings, that's really our full solution that we offer. You're getting more hooks into them, and particularly when they have their health insurance with us. If they have their health insurance with us, if they were to leave the PEO, that would be very disruptive for their employees. They may have to get new insurance cards. They may have to -- they might be in a different network, might have to change doctors. So, it's very disruptive. And so, you get a lot of hooks into them in that model. And as you know, retention is a big driver of lifetime value. So, although, when we're selling clients, we want to put them in the right model that meets their needs. Ultimately, and that was, as we've talked about, one of our strategies this year is to really to go back into that base, get them over into that PEO model, because the economics in that model over the long term are very favorable. And so that's part of our strategy. Tien- Tsin Huang : Got it. Yeah. I know the notionals are high, but in my mind, the payroll [indiscernible] payroll business, the retention, [indiscernible] margins are so high, I figured that was also tough competition... Bob Schrader : Yeah, it's really the retention that drives it. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thank you for that. John Gibson : Yeah. Tien-Tsin, I think it's a very easy thing. You think about the way we approach it, you got our HCM platform, and you know that on a standalone basis, is a good business to be in. We then add our, what you'd say is ASO, so you add HR professional. Now you got someone advising your business, there's more value there. We know our retentive natures of that is high. Now you get into adding the insurance. And as Bob said, because we've done such a strong job of managing that over the long term, that there's a predictable health inflation metric, that becomes very attractive in terms of certainty for the clients there. And then you mentioned SUI, you mentioned everything else. So, you've got a profitable business on top of a sticky product and so you just keep it there. And I think the evidence is, both in terms of you look at the national studies, et cetera, is the survivability. Now it, to be fair, tends to be more attractive to larger clients, 20 plus if you will, so they naturally have a higher survivability rate, but the simple fact is what we see is there's a higher business survivability rate in those that are going with the PEO solution and then they're staying with us longer and we're getting all of the flow through and benefit of the HCM and the HR outsourcing margins. Tien- Tsin Huang : And the CAC is also low because a good chunk of it is still selling into exist. I know you said it's coming [indiscernible]... Bob Schrader : Good point. John Gibson : Good point. Tien- Tsin Huang : Okay. Very good. Thanks for the education and have a safe end of the year. John Gibson : Thank you. You too. Okay, I think that was it. At this point, we'll close the call. If you're interested in a replay of the Webex of this conference call, it will be archived approximately 90 days on our website. We would certainly want to wish all of you and your families a very safe and happy holiday season. I want to continue to thank you for your interest in Paychex and hope everyone has a great day. Take care. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's program, and we appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Paychex Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you'll have an opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note this call is being recorded. And it is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Gibson. Please go ahead. John Gibson : Thank you, Mike. Thank you, everyone for joining our discussion today on the Paychex third quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings release. Joining me today is Bob Schrader, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I'm going to start the call today with an update on the business highlights for the third quarter and then turn it over to Bob for a financial update and then of course, we'll be happy to take your questions. We delivered solid results in the third quarter and the first nine months of the current fiscal year. Total revenue growth of 4% in the third quarter reflected a lower contribution for our employee retention tax credit or ERTC service as compared with the prior year period. This is consistent with our previously communicated expectations that ERTC revenue would become a headwind in the second half of the current fiscal year. Excluding this impact, our total revenue growth accelerated to 7% in the quarter, while our new client volumes remained solid and in line, and both client and revenue retentions were in line with our expectations. Several factors including our decision to wind down the ERTC program based upon the recent legislative developments on Capitol Hill, continued moderation of employment growth within our client bases and slightly lower realized rates all combined to create headwind, a larger headwind than what we had anticipated in the quarter. With the end of the ERTC program, we are now officially in the post pandemic era at Paychex, and I will tell you I am very pleased with how our teams have performed during these past several years. We put nearly $90 billion of financial aid into the hands of our clients, and based upon an analysis by MIT, we estimate that we save over 300,000 small business jobs. While these pandemic error programs are not part of our normal reoccurring revenue product strategy or our business model at Paychex, they were certainly consistent with our purpose. And that's simply to help businesses succeed. And I believe that we are a better company today than when we entered the pandemic four years ago. We are winning in the marketplace, and our long proven a recurring revenue growth formula still holds true. And this post pandemic and digitally driven era for the company, focused client growth, value-based price realization, increased product penetration, and opportunistic acquisitions are still the key pillars of the Paychex growth strategy. We are exiting the pandemic era with an even greater focus on our purpose, more opportunities to impact our clients and their employees, and with an even stronger reputation as a trusted advisor to small and mid-sized business owners. Despite the headwinds in the quarter, we delivered 7% growth in diluted earnings per share, and expanded operating margins, due to our longstanding tradition of expense discipline. As one of the best operators in the business, we continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver on earnings in uncertain times, and still make the necessary strategic investments to drive long-term profitable growth. Our culture of expense management along with investments we've made the past several years in digitization and enhanced sales and operational excellence capabilities have positioned us well for future profitable growth as well. The macroeconomic and labor market remains challenging for small mid-size businesses, a tight job market for qualified workers reduce access to affordable growth capital and inflationary pressures continue to be headwinds for small businesses. Our small business employment watch continues to show moderation in both job growth and wage inflation. But however, a relatively stable macro environment, the softening in hiring we started to see in the second quarter continued in the third quarter. There is more choppiness in hiring across all customer segments and industries now. Our clients tell us they still can't find qualified employees and are not willing to hire just anyone at higher wage rates, especially in areas with recent minimum wage increases and aggressive legislative changes. The demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions remains robust and the volumes of new clients added in the quarter were strong. We continue to deliver value for our customers as seen on our revenue retention results, which remain above pre-pandemic levels. Client retention for the third quarter was also in line with pre-pandemic levels and both revenue and HR outsourcing work site employee retention remains at record levels. As we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high value clients. Our sustained high revenue retention demonstrates that our value proposition and our market leadership remain intact. The fundamentals of Paychex are same. I'd like to highlight the success in our PEO business specifically, which has continued to gain momentum with strong results during the first nine months of the fiscal year. We finished the quarter with strong results in sales, retention and insurance enrollment. We have continued to see a shift back towards the PEO offerings both outside and inside our client base. This shift mix has a long-term positive impact on the customer lifetime value in our model, particularly as clients attach insurance benefits. AI and related technology investments are also key areas of focus in our industry and something that, as many of you know, we've been focused on for many years. We are proud to announce that we successfully implemented in the quarter several additional innovative AI models that significantly improved results for Paychex and our clients. Leveraging innovative technology and advanced analytics has allowed us to gain deeper insights into prospects and client behavior, their preferences, and their growing needs. Last month, we announced that Beaumont Vance has joined the company as our Senior Vice President of Data Analytics and AI. In this newly created role, he will be responsible for refining and executing the company's data strategy, including the use of business intelligence, advanced analytics, and AI driven automation to drive both improved business performance and enhanced customer value. We are excited to have Beaumont on Board to help us capture the full value of our vast data assets. I want to thanks to the hard work of our more than 16,000 employees and their focus on our company's values. Paychex continues to be recognized for both what we do and more importantly in my opinion, how we do it? We are proud to be recognized for the 16th time by Ethisphere, as one of the world's Most Ethical Companies in their recent annual list. Paychex was also recently recognized by Fortune Magazine as one of the Most Innovative Companies for the second consecutive year. These recognitions and the many product and service awards that we have received in the past year and over the decades is a testament to the strength of our business model, culture and the commitment to invest in our business and our employees to deliver long-term value for our customers and investors. I'm very proud of how our employees have delivered for our customers, for each other, for our communities, and for our shareholders throughout the pandemic area. We exit at this period in Paychex history, more focused and determined to be the digitally driven HR leader in our industry, and we are even better positioned to capture the opportunities in the markets we serve. I'll now turn it over to Bob to give you a brief update on our financial results for the quarter. Bob Schrader : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by reminding everyone that today's commentary will contain certain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and therefore, involve some risks. In addition, I will periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures, like adjusted diluted earnings per share. I'd refer you to our press release for our customary disclosures around those metrics. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results and then provide an update on our fiscal '24 outlook, and as promised too many of you on the phone, I will share some preliminary thoughts around fiscal '25. Total revenue for the quarter increased 4% to $1.4 billion, which reflects a lower contribution from our ERTC as compared to the prior year quarter. Management Solutions revenue increased 2% to $1 billion. This was primarily driven by growth in the number of clients served across our suite of HCM solutions and increased product penetration, and that was offset by the decline in our ERTC revenue. And as we disclosed in the press release, that has impacted the growth by about 300 basis points. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 8% to $346 million, that was driven by higher average worksite employees and an increase in our PEO and Insurance revenues. Our PEO saw continued momentum in worksite employee growth and medical plan participant volumes during the third quarter. Interest on funds held for clients increased 25% to $44 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates. Total expenses increased 3% to $790 million. Expense growth was attributable to higher compensation costs and PEO direct insurance costs related to the higher average worksite employees as well as the higher Insurance revenues during the quarter. Operating income increased 6% to $650 million with an operating margin for the quarter of 45.1%. That represents about 80 basis points of margin expansion over the prior year period. I would like to highlight that margin expansion is despite the ERTC headwind that we just called out, we were still able to deliver really strong margin expansion in the quarter. And I think as many of you know, ERTC is pretty much like interest rates, it's pretty much all margin. Both diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 7% to $1.38. I'll quickly summarize our results for the year-to-date period. Total revenue grew 5% to $4 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 4% to $2.9 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions increased 7% to $939 million. And interest on funds held for clients increased 44% to $108 million. Total expenses for the first 9 months grew 4% to $2.3 billion. And our operating margins for the first 9 months of the year were 42.5%, and that's a 70 basis point expansion over the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 9% year-over-year to $3.62 and $3.60, respectively. I'll now give you a quick overview of our financial position. As many of you know, we maintain a strong financial position with high-quality cash flows and earnings generation. Our balance for cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments was $1.8 billion. And our total borrowings were approximately $817 million as of the end of the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the first 9 months was $1.7 billion, that's up 30% compared to the same period last year. That was driven primarily by higher net income and fluctuations in working capital. And we returned a total of $1.1 billion to shareholders through the first 9 months of the year. That includes $963 million in dividends and $169 million of share repurchases. And our 12-month rolling return on equity remains robust at 47%. I'll now turn to our updated guidance for the current fiscal year. This outlook assumes the current macro environment, which obviously had some level of uncertainty. We have revised our guidance on certain measures based on performance this quarter and this also reflects the impact of our decision to wind down our ERTC service based on recently proposed legislation. I just want to pause there from my prepared remarks to provide a little bit more color on ERTC. I think many of you guys are aware that there is bipartisan legislation out there that would end the ERTC program retro to January 31 of this year. I think it's past the House. It hasn't yet passed the Senate, but that does create a level of uncertainty around ERTC. We continue to sell it in the month of February. We made a decision based on that level of uncertainty to stop recognizing the revenue on ERTC subject to -- or subsequent to January 31 and we've essentially removed it from the forecast in Q4. And so that's part of what you see as it relates to the impact to the quarter and also impacts the guidance the updated guidance that I'm about to give you for the year. Management Solutions is now expected to grow in the range of 3.5% to 4%. We previously had guided to the lower end of the 5% to 6% range. PEO and Insurance is still expected to grow in the range of 7% to 9%, although we now expect that it will be more towards the lower end of that range. Interest on funds held for clients is still expected to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million. Total revenue is now expected to grow in the range of 5% to 6%. Our prior guidance was 6% to 7%. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $40 million to $45 million, and this is raised from the previous guidance of $35 million to $40 million. Our guidance for operating margins and effective tax rate are unchanged, although we still do anticipate being at the high end of the operating margin guidance range, which was 41% to 42%. And adjusted diluted earnings per share is still expected to grow in the range of 10% to 11%. Now let me just provide a little bit of color on the fourth quarter. We are currently anticipating total revenue growth to be approximately 5% in Q4. We expect the ERTC headwind to Management Solutions growth in the fourth quarter to be similar to what it was in the third quarter. And we would also expect the operating margins to be around 40% in the quarter. We are currently in the middle of our annual budget process and working on our expectations for the next fiscal year. We obviously will provide formal guidance like we normally do at the end of the Q4 when we get to that call. However, I will share some preliminary thoughts and I will emphasize the word preliminary around what we're expecting for fiscal '25. On a preliminary basis, we would expect total revenue growth to be consistent with the fourth quarter growth rate. And as a reminder, as I just told you, that would be in the 5% range. And this does include a headwind from ERTC of approximately 2%. I mean, ERTC, for all intents and purposes, is 0 going forward. I know what that headwind is going to be. I know what the dollar amount was this year, and it will be approximately a 2% headwind to revenue growth for FY '25 and that is assumed in the 5% range number that I gave you. And then despite this headwind, we are committed to delivering operating margin expansion in fiscal '25. We are still going through the annual budget process, working through the details. We'll provide more color as we get to the end of the year. Obviously, this is based on our current assumptions, which we are still working through. Those may change, but we'll update you again when we get to the fourth quarter. I will refer you to our investor slides on our website for additional information. And with that, I'll turn it back over to John. John Gibson : Okay. Thank you, Bob. Mike, we'll now open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we do have our first question from Mark Marcon with Baird. Mark Marcon : So ERTC, just one thing just to clarify, Bob. When you talked about that you sold it in February, but because of the legislation you're going to end. It's basically bipartisan and it's basically going to end retroactively in January 1. So you then stopped recognizing the revenue. Did you -- is any ERTC revenue from -- that you sold from January 1 through February actually included in the third quarter number that you just reported? Bob Schrader : Yes. Everything that we sold and filed in the month of January, Mark, is included in the quarter, but nothing beyond January 31. So we continue to sell it in the month of February. I would say the faucet was still running steady in February in ERTC and we made the decision not to recognize revenue around that just because there's so much uncertainty. And obviously, we're telling our clients that because of that level of uncertainty, if that bill does pass, we would not -- we would refund their monies for the service that we sold in the month of February. So we think it's the right decision from an accounting standpoint to stop recognizing revenue on it. And then I would just say, as we move forward in the month of February, that faucet has slowed to a drip on ERTC. Obviously, we're not focused on it and it's there's probably a little bit that came in, in March, but that was probably stuff that we already had kind of in the queue that we were still processing. It's pretty much that program is over. And yes, go ahead. Mark Marcon : I mean, just related to the guide that you were providing, I was -- obviously, for the third quarter within Management Solutions because of the ERTC headwind, things were tougher and it seems like you actually did see some acceleration ex ERTC on total revenue. So I was just wondering like is there any way to quantify the impact in terms of not recognizing that revenue in February just because obviously you were anticipating that coming in. So any thoughts there? Bob Schrader : Yes. I mean, high level, Mark, I mean we provided guidance for the quarter. I think we -- you guys know what the guidance was that we provided for the quarter. The Q3 actually came in maybe about 100 basis points in that range lower than what we had said. And I would say probably 1/3 or a little bit more of that was related to the decision that we took on the ERTC. So you could probably do the math on that and back in to get to a number that's close to the impact in February. Mark Marcon : Okay. Great. And then with regards to the margin expansion, obviously, that's very encouraging, especially when you're not getting that benefit from ERTC. What are the key drivers in terms of that? Is it the AI initiatives? Is it efficiency on the sales side? What's driving the margin expansion? And how do you think -- to what extent do you think you're going to be able to continue that strong progress? John Gibson : Yes, Mark, this is John here. Again, as you know, we pride ourselves in being the best operators in the industry and have a DNA of -- and we know the levers to pull as we see the type of trends that we see. So we've certainly done those, what I would say, typical things, but the deeper question you're asking is the right one. The fact of the matter is over the past 3 years, we've done a lot of investments as we've had the opportunity with the ERTC benefit to make a lot of investments in the business. We really focus that investment around our digitalization and digital adoption capabilities. We've built global capabilities in our operations footprint. And we started to really roll that out and really test and pilot that over the course of this fiscal year. And particularly during selling season, a lot of the enhancements both on the client service and retention side as well as the digital onboarding across each of our platforms, we launched a series of products that demonstrated to us at scale that we can drive stronger operational and sales efficiency in our model. And so we're going to continue to double down on that and continue to look for opportunities that we can drive digital transformation in our back office; drive digital adoption by our prospects and channel partners, clients and employees. And we believe that's going to continue to drive margin expansion. That's what we've seen in these tests and pilots and now we're really starting to push and roll that out at scale. Operator : And we have our next question from Kevin McVeigh with UBS. Kevin McVeigh : On the execution. I guess, Bob, just would be for you the 25% guidance preliminary, pretty helpful. Any sense of what type of macro environment you're factoring into that, I guess, from an employment perspective more broadly? Bob Schrader : Yes, Kevin, I mean, we're still going through and finalizing all of our assumptions. But I would say at this point in time, we would assume a fairly stable, steady macro environment. Obviously, there's an expectation that the Fed is going to start cutting rates later this year. We do have some of that factored in at this point in time. But I would say, overall, the assumption is a fairly steady-state macro environment with some expectation that there'll be rate cuts as we move into the fiscal year. John Gibson : Yes. And Kevin, I would just add on that on the macro side, we are adjusting our view and have adjusted our view even more as we looked at the third quarter based upon some of the hiring dynamics that we're seeing in the client base because there is somewhat of a disconnect when you look at an economy that's growing at 3% to 3.5%, high 2s, even if you go back and what you're seeing from a hiring perspective. And I would say the state of hiring in small businesses continues to be a challenge. I think it's a labor issue. It's not a demand issue. What we continue to see is clients telling us they're having trouble filling open positions, and quite frankly, with qualified candidates. I think one of the things that professionals that are engaged, as you know, we have about 2.2 million of our client worksite employees under management by our HR team, so as we saw some of the trends we saw that were disconnected from our models in a 3% GDP economy, why weren't we seeing the hiring that we would have anticipated happening in the base, we had active structured dialogues with those clients and what we're hearing is that they have open positions. They want to hire. They can't find qualified people. And I think they had been burned through the course of the pandemic in hiring just anyone. And so they're not willing to do that at the current labor rate. So the macro environment that we see, you look at our job index, continued moderation in hiring, continued moderation in wage inflation. We saw that January and February -- I would say this December, January and February, if you look at our releases, continued to show moderation. And actually January and February were the first 2 months in our index, still over 100, still showing growth, but those were the first 2 months that we actually saw growth under pre-pandemic levels. And so stay tuned. Tomorrow we'll release the March one, but what I would tell you is that what we see is a moderating economy. We see a stable economy. We don't see signs of a recession. We don't see all the other -- demand was strong. Our pipeline was strong. The other things that you would typically see that would be more recessionary, we're not seeing mass layoffs. We're not seeing layoffs across. What we're seeing is openings, vacancies, troubled hiring and businesses being cautious in who they're bringing into their workforce. Kevin McVeigh : Lot of sense. And then, John, just to follow up on that point. Is that -- is kind of that tight labor what's driving kind of the reenrollment on the Insurance side of the PEO? Or just anything to call out in terms of what's been driving that? John Gibson : I think on the PEO enrollment, I want to really give credit to the team there. I think, as you recall, a year ago, a little over a year ago, this was a challenging area for us. We were seeing things, participation rates weren't as high. Attachment wasn't as high. We really look at all aspects of both our product, our insurance product offerings, our enrollment processes and how we engage employees around that top to bottom. And we made some changes in both the product offerings we have as well as we approach clients and the employees in our insurance offerings in the PEO. And I think the team has done a good job there. And what we've seen is now we're back to at to slightly above attachment rates and our participation rates are back to our historical norm. So I think that was a little bit more of an execution issue than any macro item. Operator : And we have our next question from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : I wanted to ask on PEO, I know the commentary around sales retention and attach was quite strong and then you moved into the low end. I'm just curious if maybe you can elaborate on that and maybe your initial thinking around PEO momentum going into next year as well because I know that was something that we were tracking. John Gibson : Yes, go ahead. Bob Schrader : So I'll just start with the -- no, no, no. So I'd say the big driver of maybe guiding more towards the lower end of the range, it was with the employment headwinds that John called out in the script, we continue to see moderation in employment, and that really was across the board. For the most part, the PEO has been able to outrun it with strong execution, both in sales retention. We mentioned we continued to see record levels of worksite employee retention. Really strong worksite employee growth in that business and then really getting our medical insurance attachment and volumes back to where we see it. So it's really a little bit of the macro headwind. And the other thing I'll call out on the PEO, I think the print is strong at 8%. But as you guys know, that, that category is PEO and Insurance, and Insurance is typically dilutive to the growth of that overall category. So I would say that the PEO stand-alone growth is north of that number, obviously, that we gave you. So really strong performance in the PEO business. And we're building momentum and we see that carrying into next year. I'm not ready to give splits on next year between Management Solutions and the PEO , but we certainly would expect the PEO and Insurance to grow at a faster overall rate than the total revenue growth that I gave you. Tien- Tsin Huang : Got it. Okay. Very clear. So it's just really the employment side that's out of your control. Perfect. So my quick follow-up, just on the pricing front among the 3 factors, you mentioned pricing last. Any more color on the pricing? Is it more discounting that you're seeing? And I'm curious if that informs your typical price action that you would take in the May or the spring time frame. And if that's baked into your look-ahead or preliminary '25 outlook? John Gibson : That is a broad question. So if I missed something, you come back. But here's what I would say, we're still able to go into the market and command our traditional value-based pricing for the value we provide. I think you can see that in the retention. And what I would tell you is, again, and I'll be so glad when I don't have to use this word again, which I think will probably be 12 months from now, ex ERTC. When I look at our actual revenue per client with ERTC was in a lot of the pricing bundles that we would sell when you're looking at the data is we're actually seeing that the pricing that we're getting across the various product groups being on par of what we have seen historically. I would remind you that over the last 3 years, we have guided and have said what's been at the high end of our traditional range. And I think that our assumption is as we go into the post-pandemic era that we're going to -- like everything else seems to be going back to the mean to slightly higher. So when I look at retention, again, retention back to kind of pre-pandemic levels, but slightly better. I think that's where you'll see pricing, and we still feel good about where we can go in terms of pricing. I think the competitive environment, it's always been a competitive environment. I think there were 2 dynamics going on that were interesting to me when I looked at the data. And again, when I'm looking across -- when I'm looking across our 401(k) business, our PEO business, our HCM mid-market business, our small business HCM business, our SurePayroll business, I just -- when I go across our insurance business, the broad set of businesses and look at the third quarter, which is one of our largest volume quarters, and I see the volume hold up to what I expected. But what was interesting, the average client size was down in almost all of those slightly, which impacts our realized price, right? You just have less employees, you have less checks. And what I sense is, is that they're in the -- if you think of our business, boulders, rocks and pebbles, right? I think boulders have been harder to move. Less decision. You've heard some other competitors that are more targeted in the upper end of the market talk about extended decision time frames, et cetera. So while we got the volume we expected, we got a little more rocks and pebbles than we expected, which drove a little bit of the rate. And then it was a more competitive environment in terms of both clients from a retention perspective and from a purchase perspective, demanding more and I would say being a little more negotiative in their approach, which is kind of what you sense in the economy with high inflation. Operator : And we have our next question from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Bryan Bergin : I wanted to just dig in a bit more on bookings. Can you just talk about how the third quarter bookings came in relative to your expectations? How 4Q is trending so far? And if you can, give us some added color across client size, PEO versus ASO as well. John Gibson : Yes. Bryan, I would just probably reiterate what I've kind of already said. We had solid demand for our solutions really across the board. Volumes were in line with our expectations. What I said before is across each one of those sectors, I would say that the average size of the deal that we landed was smaller than what we anticipated than typical. So -- and I'm talking small, small amounts of differences. But as you all know, in a business of our scale, a small change going from average 1 or 2 employees or 3 or 4 employees or worksite employees per deal, it can have an impact on the revenue you expect. Bryan Bergin : Okay. Understood. And then just on the sales front and sales investment, I guess, can you give us a sense on how sales head count has trended relative to the start of the year? And as you go forward and plan for '25, how are you thinking about adding absolute sales head count versus trying to lean on more tech investments to drive more productivity? John Gibson : Yes. Bryan, I would say this, our sales head count has been at our expectations through the year. When we went into the selling season, we were at head count, that's what we reported. I think to your point, what was interesting in the third quarter, when I look holistically across the business, the amount of business we drove digitally across each of the platforms was impressive. And that's approaching some of our other channels that have historically been Paychex's bedrock of where we've gotten business. And so what we're seeing is and what we're doing with digital, I think, will continue to be something, and we're looking at a lot of different go-to-market strategies that we think will drive more productivity in our sales reps. And I think what we're trying to do right now is make sure we're doing the proper territory management so that we can have even more reps more productive. So I'm not prepared -- we're still working through our final budget planning process. What I can tell you is that we're driving a lot of productivity on a per rep basis. And we're going to make sure that we're covering every nook and cranny of the market. So making sure how many salespeople do we actually need to go after the market opportunity we have in each of the segments? And I think getting more specific about segment sizes and product type is what we're focused on as part of our new go-to-market strategy going into this post-pandemic era. Operator : And we have our next question from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Samad Samana : So maybe, first, we've heard about maybe pricing increases going into effect, let's call it, either towards the end of the year or earlier this year. I was just curious if there is a change in the timing of when you push through price increases for customers this year? And then I have a follow-up question as well. Bob Schrader : Yes, I'll take the first question. Yes. No change to the amount. I mean, I think your timing, it's not always the exact time every year, but it's in that range typically towards the ended the fiscal year. Beginning in the next fiscal year is typically when we have our annual price increases. So really no change to the timing there. Samad Samana : Okay. Great. And then I guess just as you think about segmenting by customer size, I know what you just said about the average deal size, comparing it being smaller, but are you seeing any trends within if you stratified it by your smallest customers versus maybe slightly more like mid-market? And then same question between Management Solutions and PEO, if we're seeing anything that's different by the type of customer that you're seeing in terms of behavior or deal size or deal closing times. John Gibson : No. So I don't really see much change overall. What I would say is, and part of this I'm reading what I hear others have said that play in markets. And when I look at our -- by deal size. So we've got a mid-market team, we've got a PEO team, they're out in the market outside the base. And they're going after deals and they're getting an average deal size and we'll get a mix. We'll get this number of clients over 1,000 employees, as many 500 to 999, you get to drill, right? And on average, you just -- you get a mix and that's the mix that kind of holds in the marketplace kind of historically. What I think you see when I look across it, and Bob can comment as well, is that on the larger side, the larger end, the enterprise end of that market, there was less of those deals that came in, in the PEO, came in, in the ASO and came in, in the traditional HCM and we made up the volume in more slightly average size deals that we get. But then when you add that all together because you have less boulders to the mix, you have a little less, either worksite employees or less checks than you planned on. Does that make sense? Samad Samana : I'm going to break it -- it does. I'm going to squeeze one more in. I know 2 are normally the limit. But just is there -- I know you're not guiding by segment for next year, but is there any reason, Bob, to assume that the trend line that you've guided for, for next quarter for Management Solutions ex ERTC and PEO, like what's implied in the guide that, that wouldn't be the trend line heading into next year? I guess, is there anything that would materially get you off of those trend lines? Bob Schrader : Yes. I mean I wouldn't say significantly, Samad. I don't want to get into providing specifics on the 2 categories yet as we're still going through our annual budget process. But we certainly would expect the PEO and Insurance category growth next year to be similar to what we've seen this year and Management Solutions is where the big headwind is with ERTC. But I would say similar trend lines to where we're exiting the year. Samad Samana : Great. Thank you so much. Have a great day. John Gibson : Samad, I appreciate that you recognizing the three questions. I remind everyone of the effort rule. Although he's gone. Operator : We have our next question from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : This is Caroline on for Jason. So in terms of capital deployment heading into 4Q and also 2025, can you give an update on the relative attractiveness of buybacks versus M&A? And then also, could you give an update on like the general health of your M&A pipeline? John Gibson : Bob, you want start with the M&A? Bob Schrader : Yes. Look, I would say that we continue to be open to acquisitions that meet the strategic objectives that we've laid out and that make financially sense. I would say that I feel like in several areas and industries that we have interest that the multiples that I've seen are getting into line that are more reasonable and trying to be active. And the key thing is just the timing of that, when is the right time of that. So we're certainly open for business, active engaging in both tuck-ins where we can add capability. We're doing a lot of things and looking at what we can do from an AI and digital HR perspective, constantly looking for adjacencies that are driving really the needs of our customers in terms of what they need to succeed and what we've talked about, the access to capital, being able to retain it and hire employees and really getting access to affordable benefits that allow them to attract clients. So all of those things are open. We've got an active engaged team that is talking to a lot of different prospects. But more to come. We certainly have the capital capability and the ability to do acquisitions, and we're prepared to pull the trigger if we can come across something that makes financial sense. John Gibson : And Caroline, I mean the only thing I would add to that, just overall as it relates to capital allocation, really no change in our approach there. We're going to continue to invest in the business. Dividends are -- we're going to continue to grow the dividend, and that will continue to be our primary use of cash. You mentioned share repurchases, really no change in our philosophy there. We do that to offset dilution from executive comp. You saw recently, a month or so ago, we did do a new share reauthorization so we can continue to do that. The old authorization had expired. And then to John's point, we certainly are interested in M&A opportunistically, and we'll continue to use M&A to drive growth in the business. So our strategy and philosophy around capital allocation is very consistent with what you are all used to in the past. Operator : And we have our next question from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : I wanted to go back on just a quick couple macro points that you're making. If I rewind back in December, you talked a little bit about some concerns you had about potential for increases in out-of-business rates, et cetera. I'm just wondering, like how that's evolved and what your current outlook is there? And it seems like you feel better about it, but I just want to make sure I'm interpreting your comments correctly. John Gibson : Yes, Jim, I would say that out-of-business rates are not out of the norm that you would expect given the accelerated new business starts that we saw 2 to 3 years ago. Small business starts are down a little bit from those peaks and highs, but still above pre-pandemic levels. But again, it goes back to what I said before. We're not seeing signs of what would typically be seen in a recessionary period where there was accelerated out of businesses. Right now, what I would say out-of-business is elevated and particularly in the low end. But when you look at that in context of how many new businesses were started over the last 3 years, that's not atypical because within 2 years 50% are gone; within 5 years, 75% of them are gone. So that's -- it's not being driven by, what I would say, economic hardship or broad-based. Businesses that you would not expect to go out of business don't seem to be going out of business, if that makes sense. James Faucette : Yes, it does make sense. I appreciate that. And then we've talked about kind of labor scarcity pretty consistently for the last few years. And I think your incremental comments in terms of the quality of labor and specifically employers being more discerning now, it's interesting. Any specific areas or whether it be industries or geographic regions that that's important too. And I'm asking the question because I'm trying to think about what the path to resolution there is or if this is just something we're perpetually going to be grappling with? John Gibson : Well, look, what we keep trying to focus ourselves on is what more can we do to help our clients retain and attract quality employees. It's in their interest. It's certainly in our interest, given the way we get paid. I think, as you know, we launched 2 years ago the AI-based retention insights product that gives them insights to where they may have retention risk. We've got this -- the partnership with Indeed that's fully integrated, and we're actually elevating their job postings up in the listings for them as part of that partnership. We just did the Visier product, which is on the way to being launched. We'll give them compensation information to be done. We're going to be doing some things in the next fiscal year around creating benefit bundles for our non-insurance HCM clients that allow their employees to feel like being part of that employee relationship gives them access to catastrophic care. We're trying to do a lot of things to solve this problem for our clients. And obviously, there's more we need to do because the simple fact is we have a generational change happening in the labor force. Participation rates remain below pre-pandemic levels and it's going to be very difficult given the rate of retirements that we're seeing in Baby Boomers to really see that change. And what you see in the prime age workers were actually at record highs. The problem is not enough prime age people to fill all the opportunities. And then when you look at the productivity gap that you have generationally -- and that's just in terms of experience, I don't want to disparage any generation in any way. But just the fact you're replacing someone with years of experience with someone that's new or experienced, I really think this is going to be an ongoing public policy issue that's going to have to be addressed. There's a lot of retraining with AI and digital jobs. I think more needs to be done. I mean, we got the R&D tax credit thing that's sitting out there. Not to get on political bandwagon here, but we need to do more to allow businesses to invest in productivity and drive productivity enhancements and that's not going to replace workers. That's going to enable them to get the work done with less workers that are going to exist in the marketplace. So I think this is a systemic problem. I think it's a great opportunity for us because it really goes to the products and services that we offer for a small and medium-sized business owner. So that's kind of my personal view on it, and it continues to show up in the data that we look at. Operator : And we have our next question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: How much did M&A contribute in the quarter? And if you could help us think through whether there's an inorganic contribution when it comes to your preliminary F '25 guidance, what that might be as well? Bob Schrader : Yes. Ramsey, I mean, M&A, we didn't do any new M&A. The only M&A that we've done this year was the small Alterna acquisition that we did at the end of Q1. Obviously, it contributes something. It's a small number, it doesn't even round to 1%. So it's really not a big contributor at all. In the guide, we typically don't -- although we're always active in looking for opportunities, we're not going to put anything into a forecast until the deal is closed. So that does not assume any -- the preliminary guide does not assume any level of M&A next year. Ramsey El-Assal: Got it, got it. One quick follow-up for me. SECURE Act 2.0, what are you seeing there? Does that have the potential to emerge as kind of a tailwind that might help offset some of the year ERTC headwind? Or is it too early to tell? Maybe give us an update on what you're seeing on SECURE Act 2.0? John Gibson : Yes. I think, Ramsey, replacing ERTC is a very difficult thing to do, both in terms of the revenue nature of it and the profitability of it. And I would say that helping -- and basically, we're doing filing, as you know. We were doing tax filings, which is something that's core to our business and there was a lot of hype around ERTC. So there was a lot of education going on by others that was helping that. What I see in secured the SECURE Act is I think it's a great thing. I mean, our retirement business had a solid quarter and it's had solid year-to-date, and that continues to be a strong growth driver. I think you've still got to talk to business owners and educate them on it. It's still a sales process. We've had states that have made it mandatory. Those kind of come and go in the area. The other thing on the SECURE Act 2.0, which we've been pushing on is there is a little bit of a loophole that kind of disadvantages businesses with under 10 employees. I won't get into the nuances of it. And there's pretty bipartisan support in both the House and Senate to try to close that loophole and we keep pushing for that because I do think that would particularly help in our micro segment, really accelerate some adoption there. But right now, that will pull is still there. Operator : And we have our next question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. David Paige : This is David Paige on for Ashish. I just had a question on your AI initiatives. Maybe can you provide some of the customer feedback, what -- I guess, what parts of your tools or your AI models that they're liking and maybe some of the benefits you're seeing internally in terms of greater sales teams, productivity, et cetera? John Gibson : Yes. So David, what I would tell you at this point in time, a lot of our AI initiatives and investments have really been focused internally, both in terms of how we drive efficiency, how we drive better sales productivity, how we do better marketing and targeting, how we do better customer service and identify clients that are risk, how we do better pricing and discounting so that we're not getting too much away, but we're giving enough to get the right type of lifetime value that we want. Really on the client side, the retention insights has been a very popular product with our larger customers in terms of getting insights to what they're doing, and we're just in the stages of really rolling out our Visier product, which will give them basically 750 million data compensation data points that will allow our customers in real time to understand how competitive they are if they're making a job offer what they could potentially do. And that's just in the early stages. What I believe is because of our vast data set, we're going to be able to provide a degree of insights and information when coupled with our HR advisers that I truly think is going to set us apart from any of the smaller regional players or a local CPA because we're just going to be able to give them the vast data set insights that we have. And so as I've mentioned, we just hired a new SVP whose full-time job is to do nothing, but pull all of the capabilities we have across the company and develop a robust strategy of how we can drive the most out of AI to drive more value for our customers and drive more operational efficiency into the company. Operator : And we have our next question from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : I just had a couple of clarifications. The miss on revenue in third quarter versus your guided expectations, it sounded like 1/3 of that was the ERTC decision to stop recognizing the revenues. Then I'm just trying to fill in the gap and the other 2/3 of kind of versus your expectations on the miss, if I heard that correctly. Bob Schrader : That's right, Bryan. So it's roughly -- there's 3 big drivers -- 3 drivers that we've talked about. They're all small, but there's 3 drivers that we've talked about. Certainly, the continued moderation of employment -- we definitely saw lower checks per client, lower change in base relative to what our assumptions were. That started in Q2. We updated our forecast in Q2 for some of the trends that we are seeing. But I would say employment came in a little bit softer than even our revised assumptions in the forecast. And then John mentioned a little bit on the rate. We saw smaller client sizes maybe a little bit higher discounting than what we assumed. I mean, we're still getting really good price realization overall and strong growth in revenue per client. But I would say it was a little bit softer relative to what our forecast assumptions were. And then the bigger piece there was the ERTC that I mentioned. So when you look at those 3 things, they're roughly 1/3 of piece is how I would characterize it. Bryan Keane : No, that's helpful. And then when I jump from the third quarter revenue growth of 4% to the guided 5%, what accounts for the extra -- the strength of 100 basis points when I go into the fourth quarter? Bob Schrader : Yes. So I'd say there's a few things to call out there, Bryan. One, I mentioned the ERTC headwind being similar to Q3. It's a little bit less than it was in Q3, so that has a little bit of an impact. You have less of a headwind from ERTC in Q4. We're still getting a strong client base, price realization, product penetration that carries into Q4. And then I would say on the PEO side, we came out of selling season in a stronger position from a worksite employee standpoint in medical enrollment and so we're going to get the full quarter benefit of that in Q4 relative to where we were in Q3. So we got positive momentum, I would say, heading into Q4 in both businesses. And then we are getting a little bit of a lift in interest on funds in Q4. You've seen a little bit stronger growth there versus Q3. Some of that is the compare we did some repositioning of the portfolio. I think we had some -- or some realized losses that we took in Q4 to better position the portfolio going forward. And so you get a little bit of a tailwind in growth from that as well. And I'd say when you put those together, that's what accounts for a little bit stronger growth in Q4 relative to Q3. Operator : And we have our last question from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Scott Wurtzel : Just one for me. I wanted to go back to the margin side. I mean the outperformance, I think was notable despite the ERTC revenue going away. And I just wanted to clarify. I know you talked about some of the efficiencies off of the investments over the last few years. But were there any specific actions on the expense side that you took during the quarter as the ERTC revenue sort of wound down? Bob Schrader : Yes. I wouldn't say anything specific to call out, Scott. I mean, obviously, we're always trying to look at expenses and making sure that we're not letting new costs into the business and really focusing. We saw the headwind come in. So I wouldn't say there's anything specific to call out other than good expense management. And some of that margin expansion that you saw in the quarter is being driven by interest rates. But even when you exclude that, we saw good margin expansion during the quarter. John Gibson : Yes. I don't want to shortchange the tremendous job that each and every employee does in the company in terms of managing expenses. And we have it built into our DNA when we say, hey, we're seeing signs it's time to go. People know what to do and they do it. Because again, as Bob pointed out, some of that PEO and Insurance revenue is direct revenue pass-through. So when you look at our margins, you think some of that revenue into ERTC. I just want to come in how good a job we've done and I think have done historically as part of our just DNA as being the best operators. And so it's every little bit, every little thing matters. And so there's no one big thing. I would say that the insights that we're gaining and the opportunity for digitalization, the investment we've made in enabling our clients and their employees to engage our systems and the rate in which they're adopting that opportunity is tremendous. And we've invested over the last several years into building out both our AI robotics capabilities and our global footprint. And I think all of those investments we've made over the last 3 years during the pandemic era, when we had ERTC are going to serve us well as we move forward. So I just look at it and say, as we exit this era of the pandemic from a Paychex perspective, I think we're entering the new era of just fundamentally a better positioned company. I think we're a more positioned, trusted adviser to small businesses. We're delivering more value to our customers. They're rewarding that with retention and with better pricing in a market where there's a lot of cheaper alternatives out there. We're more digitally enabled in all aspects of our business than we've ever been. And I think we're more agile and focused and also more profitable, quite honestly. So hats off to the team for all the things we've done to get ourselves in this position that when the tide turned, we had leverage we could pull to make sure that we're delivering for our shareholders. Operator : And that does conclude our Q&A session for today. John Gibson : Okay. Well, listen, everyone, at this point, we'll close the call. If you're interested in a replay of the webcast of the conference call, it will be archived for approximately 90 days. And I want to thank you for your interest in Paychex and hope all of you have a great day. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation.

After the speakers\u2019 opening remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and therefore involve some risks. In addition, the company will periodically refer to non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Please refer to their press release for further information. I would now like to turn the call over to John Gibson, Paychex President and CEO. Please go ahead. John Gibson : Thank you for joining us for our review of the Paychex Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Fiscal Results. Joining me today is Bob Schrader, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending May 31, 2024. You can access our earnings release and investor presentation on our Investors Relations website. Our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I'll start the call today with an update on the business highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Bob will review our financial results for fiscal year 2024 and outlook for fiscal year 2025. We'll then open it up for your questions. As we close out the fiscal year, I am pleased to report that Paychex delivered solid financial results, reflecting our ability to navigate changing market conditions by providing both innovative HR technology and advisory solutions that continue to deliver value for our clients and their employees. And as the best operators in the business, we are continually finding ways to run our business more efficiently. For fiscal 2024, we achieved 5% growth in total revenue and 11% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share. These results are a testament to the hard work and dedication of our more than 16,000 employees and the investments we have made in our technology and advisory solutions. Revenue retention remains near record levels, and HR outsourcing work site employee retention continue to improve and hit new record levels. We believe our sustained high revenue retention demonstrates that our value proposition is resonating in a competitive marketplace. Our client retention for fiscal year 2024 was in-line with last year and pre-pandemic levels without a business losses back to pre-pandemic levels but stable. We continue to see demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions. Our activity and pipelines remain strong and in fact increased year-over-year in the fourth quarter. But close rates were softer than historical norms and our expectations. Sales results in some market segments faced headwinds in the quarter. In SMB, we made some adjustments to our go-to-market strategy and in our digital technology stack in the micro segment, which impacted our lead and sales volumes. We believe these are one-time issues which we have addressed. In the mid-market, we have seen some of the same pressures our competitors have mentioned with delays in decision-making and increased focus on cost. Our HR outsourcing, both ASO and PEO, and our retirement business continue to perform well and we believe the value proposition for those solutions remains strong. The breadth of our solutions, both technology and complete outsourcing advisory solutions, along with the market segments we serve, provides us with the ability to pivot our sales and marketing investments as market conditions change to maximize the opportunity. Small and mid-sized businesses continue to face a challenging operating environment due to complex regulations, a historically tight labor market, and persistent inflationary pressures. Our Small Business Employment Watch has shown stabilization in job growth and continued downward pressure in hourly wages in the recent months. In fact, our May index posted the biggest one-month increase in job growth this year. We also saw improvements in hiring within our client base with both better checks for clients and worksite employee growth in the quarter after a few quarters of declines. As we mentioned last quarter, our data and conversations with clients, reveal they are having a tough time finding qualified candidates. As an innovative leader in our industry, we took this as an opportunity to find a way to help these businesses by launching a new program starting in our PEO called the Employer of Choice Playbook. This program combines our digital HR technology and analytics, with our dedicated HR professionals dedicated HR professionals to work directly with our clients to find, attract, hire, and retain qualified employees. It starts with our digital recruiting and hiring technology which provides both seamless integrations with the top job boards. This solution streamlines and automates the hiring process for the employer and provides a better candidate experience. Our PEO clients are able to attract top talent by offering a Fortune 500 suite of employee wellness benefits as well. To help them retain employees, our HR professionals proactively work with our clients to leverage our HR data analytics and our retention insights to identify at-risk employees, determine the top drivers of turnover, and implement strategies to engage and develop their people. We are excited to offer a comprehensive solution to help our clients solve one of their biggest problems, hiring and retaining talented employees. We are planning more innovations in this area for all our market segments in the coming fiscal year. Our PEO business has continued to gain momentum with excellent performance in fiscal year 2024. We finished the year with strong results in sales, retention, and insurance enrollment. We have continued to see a shift back towards the PEO offering, both inside and outside our client base. This mix shift has a long-term positive impact on lifetime value in our model, particularly as clients attach insurance benefits. Our retirement services business was another strong contributor in the fourth quarter with double-digit revenue growth. As the industry leader in 401(k) plan record-keeping in the US, with approximately $52 billion in assets under management and over 120,000 clients. We are dedicated to helping small and mid-sized business owners, offer an affordable retirement solution for their employees. According to our own data less than half of US Employers currently offer a retirement plan. We are committed to providing affordable solutions to these companies that will help them offer their employees the opportunity for a secure retirement. Legislation like the Secure Act and Secure Act 2.0, the introduction of pooled employer plans and state mandates are helping to address the growing retirement crisis in the US, but there is still more to be done. We are committed to educating business owners and industry professionals on available programs, potential tax benefits, and the cost-effective plans available to them and their employees by Paychex. As you know, AI has been a hot topic in our industry and is something we have focused on for many years. Our AI initiatives and investments have been centered around enhancing our customer service model and identifying clients that are at risk, optimizing our pricing and discounting strategies, and driving higher sales productivity through improved marketing and targeting efforts. Additionally, we are focused on harnessing the power of our vast data to drive more value for our customers and continue to drive greater operational efficiencies across the company. We continue to gain recognition for the strength of our technology. For the fifth consecutive year, Paychex Flex, the company's cloud-based SaaS solution, earned an HR Tech Award for Best Small Business Focused Solution in the Core HR and Workforce category from White House Research and Advisory. For the tenth time, Paychex was named among the best employers in excellence in health and well-being, which affirms our long-standing commitment to our own employees. Paychex was also recently recognized by Forbes as One of the America's best employers for diversity. These recognitions and the many product and service awards that we have received in the last year and over the decades are a testament to the strength of our business model, our culture, and our commitment to invest in our business to deliver long-term value for our customers and our investors. In this post-pandemic era, Paychex is uniquely positioned to help small and mid-sized businesses navigate the challenges they face in a ever-evolving world. And we believe our value proposition to these businesses remains compelling based upon the breadth and quality of the solutions we can provide. We remain committed to our purpose to help businesses succeed, while making a positive impact on our clients, employees, communities, and shareholders. I'll now turn it over to Bob to give us a brief update on our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Bob? Bob Schrader : Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full-year financial results and then I'll review our fiscal 2025 outlook. Total revenue increased 5% to $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, which reflects a lower contribution from our ERTC service, and this impacted revenue growth by approximately 300 basis points in the quarter. Management Solutions revenue increased 3% to $930 million. This was driven primarily by growth in the number of clients served across our HCM solutions and increased product penetration partially offset by lower ERTC revenue. PEO and insurance solutions revenue increased 9% to $327 million. This was primarily driven by higher average worksite employees and an increase in our PEO insurance revenues. Our PEO saw continued momentum in worksite employee growth and medical plan participant volumes during the fourth quarter. Interest on funds held for clients increased 54% to $38 million. This was primarily due to higher average interest rates and invested balances and lower realized losses on investment sales related to some repositioning of the portfolio that happened in the prior year period. During the fourth quarter, we did recognize a one-time charge of $39 million related to cost optimization initiatives. These initiatives include a reduction of our underutilized real estate, a re-prioritization of our technology investments towards AI, and headcount optimization. These measures, along with strong expense management during the year, will allow us to reallocate resources to invest in our strategic priorities, as well as continue to deliver operating margin expansion for fiscal 2025, despite the expiration of the ERTC program. Including these charges, total expenses increased 5% to $813 million. Excluding these charges, total expenses were relatively flat for the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year period. Operating income increased 6% to $482 million with an operating margin of 37.2%. Adjusted operating income, which excludes the one-time costs recognized in the fourth quarter, grew 15% to $521 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 40.2%. This represents 330 basis points of margin expansion over the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.05 per share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15% to $1.12 in the fourth quarter. Now I will quickly summarize our full year results. Total revenue grew 5% to $5.3 billion and reflects a lower contribution from our ERTC service and that impacted growth about 100 basis points on a full year basis. Management solutions revenue increased 4% to $3.9 billion. PEO and Insurance solutions increased 8% to $1.3 billion. Interest on funds held for clients increased 47% to $146 million. Total expenses grew 4% to $3.1 billion, excluding the one-time costs I discussed earlier. Expense growth was approximately 3% for the year. Operating income increased 7% to $2.2 billion. And adjusted operating income increased 9% to $2.2 billion with a margin of 41.9% and that's an expansion of 130 basis points over the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $4.67 per share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $4.72 per share. Our financial position remained strong at the end of the year with cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments of $1.6 billion and total borrowings of approximately $817 million. Our cash flow from operations for the year was $1.9 billion and that's up 11% from the prior year. That was driven primarily by higher net income and fluctuations in working capital. We returned $1.5 billion to shareholders during the year. That included $1.3 billion of dividends and $169 million of share buybacks. And our 12-month rolling return equity remains robust at 47%. I will now turn to our guidance for the fiscal year 2025. This outlook assumes the current macro environment, which has some level of uncertainty. Our current outlook is as follows. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 4% to 5.5%. If you take the midpoint of this range, that is consistent with the preliminary thinking we provided last quarter. And as a reminder, this includes approximately 200 basis points of headwind from the expiration of ERTC. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%. I'll now give you the breakdown of some of the components. Management solutions is expected to grow in the range of 3% to 4%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 7% to 9%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $150 million to $160 million. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $35 million to $40 million. Those last two metrics both are impacted by short-term interest rates. We can talk more in the Q&A, but it is our expectation that the Fed begins to lower short-term interest rates as we get into the back half of the year. Operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 42% to 43%, this is also consistent with our preliminary expectations around margin expansion, and our effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%. Turning to the quarter, we anticipate total revenue growth of approximately 2%. The first quarter growth rate is impacted by two headwinds. The first is the ERTC headwind that you are all familiar with. The second one is one less processing day in the quarter versus the prior year, and it's one of our largest revenue days. Combined, these two items represent a headwind of more than 400 basis points to revenue growth. We would also expect an operating margin in the range of 40% to 41% in the quarter. Of course, all of this is based on our current assumptions which are subject to change, we'll update you again on the first quarter call. I will refer you to our investor slides on our website for additional information. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to John. John Gibson : Thank you, Bob. We will now open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, the floor is open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Bryan Bergin : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thank you. Maybe we'll just kick off with the demand and the go-to-market commentary that you had there, John. Can you just give more color on your comments on the lower close rates and the go-to-market changes you need to make? I'm curious if that was required because of something in your strategy and sales practices or reactions to just how clients are spending it and their changing behaviour. John Gibson : Yeah, Brian, just step back. I'd say, we had solid demand on our solutions for the year. You know, activity was high across the teams. As we talked about, and you can tell from the results, the HR outsourcing and HR advisory areas are really picking up attraction with the market. That's what we're seeing versus the pure-tech. And so we certainly are pivoting heavy into that retirement also is another area where we can see that. So look we see good demand for our products and the services. The changes we are making are really -- we talked about on the last call, we are really relooking at -- as you can imagine, we just went through the last three years of a pandemic year. As the ERTC program ends, we are really refreshing our entire go-to-market talking points, our sales place our marketing position and really focused on the things that we find clients are most concerned about in today's post-pandemic world. And those things are attracting and retaining qualified employees in a very stable market. The second thing is being able to get access to afford benefits with health inflation likely to continue to increase, and they really got to be able to put together a benefits package to be able to [go out] (ph) and compete against larger firms. And then the third thing is access to capital both constrained capital and cost of capital. I think you know we made a little tuck-in acquisition of a company alter that we are very excited about, and we continue to expand our digital access to Fintechs, so that our clients have access to capital during the payroll process as well. So we're really trying to retrain our sales team on those new areas. We also are pivoting some of our resources into those market segments where we think, there is going to be higher growth as we go into fiscal year 2025. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Kevin McVeigh with UBS. Kevin McVeigh : Thanks so much. And always super, super helpful commentary. John, could you maybe talk a little bit about -- because I find your commentary in the press release is super helpful. Just it seems like the environment overall, if we\u2019re hearing you\u2019re right, it's still relatively tight labor as opposed to maybe some increase in capacity. Maybe -- are we right on that and maybe think about the kind of the current environment in terms of clients and where they are kind of retention rates are of their employees. Has there been any change at the margin on that? I just want to start there because it feels like some of the macro data, [employment related] (ph) on a little bit, but definitely -- if I'm understanding right it doesn't seem like you're seeing that yet? Or am I not thinking about that right? John Gibson : Look, I think on the macro area, what we continue to see is growth and moderate growth. We continue to see wage inflation cool. I would tell you, in May in our report, we had the biggest one month increase there. As we said in our comments, we actually saw growth in checks and worksite employee in the fourth quarter, and that was a positive trend. We started engaging because, again when you got the economy growing at the rate it is growing, our models would suggest that you'd see more hiring. So to your point, what's going on here. And what we did is we went out and started looking at our analytics and data and to point retaining clients is a challenge for small business owners. Second, attracting qualified. And so we started engaging them. We did a lot of surveys. And what we found was they have open positions, they are just struggling to find them with qualified individuals. And I think, another thing they learned during the pandemic when everyone was just trying to hire just anybody that hiring just anybody doesn't help your culture or your workforce. And so I think, they are being a little more selective. So we rolled out a series of products we'll have more on the way. We started it in the PEO because that's an area where we have a lot of direct contact with the client and their employees and started doing a lot of comprehensive work both on retention and helping them directly attract using both our technology capabilities, as well as our AI capabilities and then directly building recruit strategies, and we saw success in that program, and we are going to look to continue to move that forward as we go forward. But I'm not -- we're not seeing any side of a recession or hearing from our clients are seeing payoffs or those type of things that we would typically see in a recessionary period. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. James Faucette : Great. Thank you very much. I want to go back a little bit on the changes you were making in the micro segment. And just to be clear, was that something that you felt like you needed to do for your own product? Or are you seeing some market pressures, et cetera, on that segment? And when you say onetime, how quickly should we start to see some of those sales conversions, et cetera come back to more normalized levels? John Gibson : Yes. Look, we'll make this pretty simple. As we got through the selling season, as everyone knows, after our selling season is the time to begin to introduce new technology platforms and other things into our sales and marketing engine as we gear up for the next fiscal year. Look, one of the things we are constantly trying to do is improve the prospect experience digitally from the time of attrition, all the way through to running their first payroll and doing as much of that digitally as possible. One of the things that we've been working on were some ways in which we want to improve that customer experience in ways that we thought we could enhance digital attraction in the micro market. This is -- think of this in the digital micro market. We made some technology platform changes. We introduced some other third-party capabilities there. And to just be bought, we had some integration issues. And any time you have a disruption in that process, the people bug out of the process. And so you just did not have the -- you had to leave the conversion issues. Now we can go back and go after those individuals. But again, it was just not smooth, and we've got that behind us at this point in time. So that was what I would say a very specific market segment and a very specific technology upgrade that we were doing. And I do believe that, that upgrade will end up giving us better conversion rates and better attraction rates as we go into fiscal year 2025. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next one from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Samad Samana : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So maybe first, just on some of the assumptions underpinning the outlook for the year. I guess, first when you think about the cost action that you did in the fourth quarter, Bob was that factored in when you gave the preliminary outlook for 2025? I'm just trying to understand how much the cost action is influencing the EPS growth outlook? And then I have a couple more quick follow-ups. Bob Schrader : Yes. Sure, Samad. Thanks for the question. Yes. I mean it absolutely was factored in. I'd say -- the only thing that surprised us about the end of ERTC was that -- it happened probably a quarter earlier than what we expected. But we've been -- we knew that it was going to come to an end this year. So we've been really focused all year on preparing for that. John has actually been talking to the team about it for two years, telling us that it was going to come to an end. So we've been focused on our cost savings initiatives, really trying to find ways to continue to enhance our digital capabilities, find ways to be more productive, more efficient while making investments in the business to prepare for this, really focused on not letting new costs in the business. And so we've been working on a plan for 12 months. What you saw as it relates to the cost actions that's been underway for some time. Obviously, I wasn't going to communicate it, but I had a high degree of confidence on the execution of those plans which enabled me to provide the preliminary color around margin expansion that I did on the last call. Samad Samana : Great. And then as I just look at the data from this year, it looks like client growth was about 60 basis points if I look at the 745,000 clients versus the 740,000 ending last year, and WSE grow 2.3% versus 2.2% is about 4.5% growth. What are you assuming for, I guess client growth and WSE growth in the fiscal 2025 outlook? . John Gibson : Yes. So a couple of things. We disclosed round numbers there. So the client base growth was closer to 1% when you kind of do have the full numbers and not the round numbers Samad. And I'm not sure on the worksite employee because our worksite employee growth was upper single digits. It was strong both in ASO and PEO and it was close to double digits, I'd say on the PEO, we've had a lot of strength there. So I'd have to look at those numbers again, but the worksite employee growth across both solutions has been extremely strong this year in particular, in that PEO business. Samad Samana : Great. And I know it is breaking the rules, but I'm going to squeeze a third one in because it was kind of how you'd question it. John Gibson : You did this last time, Samad I remember. You're on my [indiscernible] side. [technical difficulty] I'm sorry, was your follow-up question on what the assumption is for next year related to those metrics? Samad Samana : Yes. Yes. What are you embedding in the guidance, right? Just trying to get an idea of how you're thinking about the building blocks between, let's call it seats or units versus price action versus retention changing in any direction? Just trying to try and get a little bit more on how that for the 4% to 5.5% range breaks out and what the factors in -- what underpins that? Bob Schrader : Yes Samad. I would say, it's -- our growth formula, which has proven in the 5% -- or the 4% to 5.5%, you take the midpoint of that, you got to factor in the 200 basis point headwind from ERTC. I would say, very similar. We're always putting together plans. We're trying to find ways to be more productive from a sales standpoint, trying to sell more and lose less and drive client-based growth. I'd say we are not as maybe dependent on that as others because we have lots of different solutions that we can sell. And we want to get client base growth. And then the big part of the formula is really going back into that base. And getting a larger share of wallet over time, we've driven a lot of growth historically and our ability to do that when you look at the kind of the penetration rates in those key solutions. And John really mentioned them, ASO, PEO, retirement. We have a lot of momentum in those businesses, and there is still a lot of runway within the existing client base. Pricing, we've talked a little bit this year about maybe pricing being a little bit of a headwind or a little bit less than our expectations, I will tell you the price realization in our model is still strong. Maybe our expectations. This year, we're a bit high, but pricing in our model is still strong and that would be a contributor to growth next year, maybe not at the same level as the last couple of years. But when you kind of put those things together, that gets you close to that growth rate ex-ERTC that's implied in the guide. Samad Samana : Great. Thanks again for taking my questions. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Caroline Latta : Hi. This is Caroline Latta on for Jason. I just wanted to get a little bit more on pricing. I know you guys just kind of mentioned it, but historically, Paychex would periodically talk about taking like 2% to 4% of price in an average year, but given that there are some signs of softness in SMBs, might the lower end of the range be more likely this year? John Gibson : I would tell you this that our growth formula that we historically have is well intact. I think that -- particularly when you even look -- I look at these numbers ex-ERTC, there are so many headwinds -- things that are difficult to look at over the last three years because you have the PPP, you have ERTC. You had a lot of onetime programs that we were engaging our clients with -- which was critical for their success. And that certainly gave us a lot of opportunities to talk to our clients about the provide. What Bob said is exactly what we would say. We continue to have good value pricing opportunities in our base and we have a demonstrated track record that as we bring clients in, we can move them up the value chain, demonstrate value and get price realization. So I think, the historical pricing capabilities that we have in the market, we continue to see and we continue to believe those are sustainable into the future. Caroline Latta : Okay, that helps a lot. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, thank you for taking my questions. And good morning. I wanted to double back on the PEO worksite employee growth that you cited. I think you said close to double digits. You mentioned both this quarter and in past quarters, some of the things that you've done and some of the things that are going really well. I just -- maybe to ask it more simply, like -- how do you get to that number? What are the number of things that you think are driving? Is it competitive differentiation? Is it the market being more receptive to more HR outsourcing? Is it something that you've done with your insurance plan. Is there any way to kind of break down kind of where all these new wins are coming from? Just a really strong number. So I wanted to get a better sense for what's going on in the market. Bob Schrader : Yes, Andrew, it is a very strong number. And the thing to remember is we did not reach our expectations in terms of work site growth inside the client base. If the economy growing at the rate it's growing, we expected to see a lot more worksite employee hires in the PEO. That's part of the reason why we put this hiring program in place in the PEO because what we heard from our clients there was they were -- they had a lot of openings, but they were struggled to find them. So these numbers are very impressive, and they're volume-driven. I think we do have a very competitive offering. We did a lot of things on our insurance program. We had strong medical attachment exceeding our expectation. And then the enrollment based upon the breadth of the offerings that we're providing to the employees, the participation rates actually increased as well. So really pretty much across the board when I look at it, I think there is increasing demand for HR advisory and HR outsourcing solutions. And again, I remind everybody that's one of the things that I think is going to end up differentiating Paychex, is we can go all the way from a pure-tech play, which maybe there was a little more choppiness it. All the way up to a full outsourcing play. And when you have inflationary and you're trying to do more with less and you're trying to look at cutting costs, the old play of outsourcing moves in there. So now do I need to add another person to my HR department. Do I even need to add an HR person. Or can I outsource that? I think there is growing demand, and I think in an inflationary and where people are being very cost conscious. Outsourcing is one of the key tools. Everyone goes to an [e-CFO] (ph) knows as you go to outsourcing when you want to cut your cost and we've got the offering to do that. And I think we've positioned our value proposition very strongly against the competitive set that we're going up against. Andrew Nicholas : Great. Thank you. That's certainly where a lot of the competitors are moving towards in terms of the spectrum. So I appreciate the color. Bob Schrader : Better late than never. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Ashish Sabadra : Thanks for taking my questions. I just had two quick questions on the first quarter guidance. First one on that if I understood correctly, 2% revenue growth, that's a material slowdown compared to 5% we saw in the fourth quarter. I understand the one less processing day but the ERTC headwinds were in the fourth quarter as well. So just trying to bridge that gap on what's causing that slowdown? And then on the margins, the margins at the midpoint of 41% to 42% would suggest a modest decline in margins in the first quarter, and so just wanted to better understand the puts and takes weighing on margins in the first quarter and then the improvement as we go through the year. Thanks. Bob Schrader : Yes, Ashish, I'm actually surprised it took this long into the Q&A to get the question on Q1. Obviously, the 2% number, I think people would look at that. And you really need -- and have some questions, you need to peel back the onion a little bit and understand it. I'd say that we -- I talked about the ERTC headwind being a 200 basis point headwind on a full year basis. Obviously, that's larger in the first half and in the first quarter, and that subsides as we go through the year. So it's north of 300 basis points. It's a stronger headwind in Q4. And then listen processing days, typically they balance out through the year in a given year. They can have an impact on the quarter. It's not going to have much of an impact on the full year, we're actually losing one of our bigger days of the week in the quarter. So that certainly is a headwind to growth. I think if you take those two headwinds. And again, I'm giving you round numbers here. You're going to -- and you do the math, you're going to get to a growth rate in Q1 that is very similar to the growth rate ex ERTC that we delivered in the back half of the year. It's very similar to that. And obviously, got to exclude interest rates because we are still getting a fairly significant lift in rates in the back half of the year. But if you look at service revenue and you add in those headwinds, you're going to see a growth rate in Q1 that's very similar to what we delivered in the back half of the year. And I'll remind everyone, we've had a significant acceleration in the growth rate of the business in the back half, ex-ERTC relative to the first half. So I know the print number or the number on the face of it looks weak, but when you factor those components, you're still seeing growth that's very similar to what we had in the back half of the year. And then on the margin, there is a lot of that is going to do -- have to do with the ERTC headwind year-over-year. I mean ERTC is was highly profitable. It wasn't 100% margin, but it was pretty close to 100% margin. And that's where you see a little bit of headwind on the margin quarter versus quarter. Ashish Sabadra : That\u2019s very helpful color. Thanks Bob. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Christiansen with Citi. Peter Christiansen : Thank you. Good morning. John, I was just hoping you could go a little bit into your middle market commentary on decision delay that you are seeing there. Is that a function of tech issues? Or is it high switching costs? Just your thoughts on perhaps now switching costs have kind of trended competitive landscape, what have you. Just it would be great to hear you expand on that dynamic just a bit more. Thank you. John Gibson : Yes. Yes. So let me maybe dive get a little deeper into this relative to volumes and what we're seeing. So volumes were up for us relative to proposals, across the major groups. And I'd remind everybody to generate a proposal in our system, and it's an AI-based system, we are actually been -- we've got to have an engaged client because there's information we want. So this is not I drove by a place and think they may be interested in Paychex. This is we counted as in our pipeline, really there's a live proposal that we've got information in the clients engaging us. So as we said, in retirement, we saw volumes up in retirement, actually acceleration in the fourth quarter. ASO and PEO strong and stable, PEO very strong, including mid-market volumes were up both in the quarter and for the full year. And what we saw there in the fourth quarter, in the mid-market was more a delay in decision-making, so longer sales cycle. So we have more active deals in the pipeline today, right, than we did last year at this time going into the fiscal year. They are not closing out and saying no, they're just more there. My sense of it is, there is a lot of shopping going on. Again, let's go back price-sensitive market. People are going out and say, can I get a better deal somewhere else? Maybe they're not as happy with their current provider or what their current provider is heading from a technology road map perspective. And so they're wanting to engage Paychex even more. So the mid-market actually for the year was very solid, very solid from a volumes perspective. What we did see in mid-market to get deals, more of the deals require discounting. So one of the things we look at is how -- what percentage of our deals do we have to give any discount to get? Believe it or not, there's a lot of deals that we don't have to give discounts to get. And then second, what is the percentage of the amount of the discount when we do have to get it. And both of those were up a little bit. The other thing I would say in the mid-market to peel it back even more, is our average deal size was down. And this phenomenon actually occurred also in the PEO, which was another site headwind even given the great results. That was in the higher end of the market, the higher end of the market, even less decision-making and slower decision making. And so again, if you think about your average deal size goes from 75 to 70, that may not seem like much, but you spread that across our volume those three extra or three less worksite employee or checks can add that to be significant. So what we saw in the mid-market was good volume, there is good activity, good proposals, a little slower decision-making. We have a good active pipeline. And I would say there's a segmentation from the upper end of that market to the lower end of the market, more buying in the lower end of the market than the upper end. Does that give you some more color, Peter? Peter Christiansen : Absolutely, it does. That is a fantastic color. But back on the discounts, I guess on an overall level, promotions discounts, all that would you say that -- that's rising? John Gibson : No, it's stable. It's really stable. Peter Christiansen : All right. That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you John. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Given the slower growth in Q1, can you help us think through the Q2 through Q4 cadence in terms of our models for management solutions. And also, if I could just tack on how much M&A contribution are you assuming in the full year guidance? Thank you. Bob Schrader : Yes. Let me start with your second question first and the answer to that is none. I mean, we did do a really small acquisition last year. There may be a few weeks of benefit, but it probably doesn't even round to [0.1] (ph). So there's really no assumption around M&A in the model. Ramsey, I don't necessarily want to get into giving you quarterly guidance here. But what I will say is, obviously, the ERTC headwind ramps down quarter-to-quarter, as we go through the year. And so the revenue growth that we see in the model, both -- total revenue management solutions is going to accelerate during the year quarter-to-quarter based on that ramp down. When I just kind of take a step back and look at maybe first half, back half ex-ERTC. I'd say right now, our thinking is the growth rates are similar from half, back half, maybe a little bit stronger but not materially different in the back half versus the front half. You saw we did that this year. We have plans in place that we're executing on. But really, the difference in the gating is primarily being driven by the ramp down of ERTC quarter-to-quarter as we move through the year. We'll get through Q1. I'm trying to provide you guys some color on Q1. And just given the pluses and minuses over the last few years with ERTC, we're trying to help you get close to where you need to be for the next quarter, but not necessarily get into setting a precedent of giving exactly where we expect to be for each quarter. I'll provide another update when we get to the end of the Q1, and we have that call. Ramsey El-Assal: Fair enough. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Keane : Hi, good morning guys. And Bob just a follow-up on that. On the one less processing day in the quarter, does that just automatically like there is a catch-up in the second quarter, so you'll see the boost that the processing day ends up adding to the second quarter. Is that how it works? John Gibson : Unfortunately no. Sometimes it does, Bryan. Sometimes it balances out in the quarter. Sometimes it balances out in the year. This day, we actually -- this year, just the way the calendar falls, we actually lose the day. But the impact to growth on a full year basis is minimal, but it impacts the quarter. So I wish I could get it back in the next quarter, but I don't, but the full year impact is minimal. Bryan Keane : Okay. And then just on the operating margin component in itself, it starts lower in the first quarter and then it ramps pretty significantly. Is there cost actions that are doing that? Or is that part of the processing, the less processing day that comes back? Or just trying to think about the take up in operating margin? John Gibson : Yes, there's the less processing day. There's the ERTC headwind, right? Again, the headwind gets smaller as you move through the year, that's high margin. So that's going to have an impact And then just in general, when you look at our margins, they're typically stronger in the back half than the first half, and that's because of some of the way we recognize revenue around some of the year-end processing stuff in Q3, which is also very high margin. So historically, if you go back and look at our margins by quarter, you're going to see the Q3 and the back half are typically a little bit higher. So those are the big differences. Bryan Keane : Got it. Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. David Togut : Thank you very much. Could you quantify the 2025 revenue or cost benefits from implementing Gen AI? You called out use of Gen AI in prospecting, and I'm curious, if you could go a little deeper into how you implement that in the business and what the financial benefits are? John Gibson : Yes. I really can't quantify it outside of just looking at how we've historically improved our operating performance without increasing our cost actually -- decreasing our cost is the way I look at it. So whether that's in the sales area, where I look at how it's been used to increase prospecting, how we\u2019ve used it to drive rep productivity. I look at it in the service area in terms of what we are doing from a retention perspective. The biggest probably benefit that we see from it quite frankly, is in this pricing and price realization area, where we can in real time, do a lot of analysis around price realization and price sensitivity at the client level. So that -- as we are both proposing to a prospect, as well as looking at the roll downs of discounts of prospects they become clients and now they're discount is rolling down. How much of that can we get back. We've gotten very sophisticated in understanding what their service experience has been, what the utilization of our product and technology has been, and we know those are predictable factors in understanding the value they're seeing us providing. And where we're having the most value being delivered to a client, as you can imagine, we can realize more price appreciation, as we benefit them over the lifetime of the client. So nothing specific that I could really pull out but I can certainly tell you that across the board, if I went and told my team, I was going to turn off AI and that kind of things, they would not be happy about keeping their commitments. Bob Schrader : Yes, I'd say another example and it kind of takes long to a question that was asked earlier about the PEO performance. Another example where we leverage these technologies is in the PEO business. I mean, we talked to you guys about this in the beginning of the year that was one of our strategies to reaccelerate growth in the business. We had a really strong year last year with ASO and we knew that we were going to be able to leverage our data in AI models to really go back into that customer base, identify those prospects that were good clients for the PEO model and really go back in and upgrade them to PEO and be able to do that in a productive and efficient way with low customer acquisition costs. And that is one of many things that we did to really improve the PEO performance this year. But I think that is a great example on the real benefit, it\u2019s having in our business model. John Gibson : Now I go back again, I guess, we pull ERTC without the models that we have from an AI perspective, ERTC would have been a very difficult and manual calculation that we would have had to have done relative to the parameters. And all of that was really done through a data and AI model that was generating reports and basically the client was giving us a couple of the missing data points that we needed to be able to complete the application and complete the processing. So if we were to -- and I think some providers actually moved away from wanting to even offer ERTC because they looked at it as a very complicated, very labor-intensive type of effort. We know a lot of our CPA partners did not want to touch it at all. And really, as Bob said, it's highly profitable because that was really built off of an AI and data model that we built and automated that entire process. David Togut : Just following up on your points around service, are you able to use Gen AI a lot to create more automated chat and reduce the labor intensity of servicing the client? John Gibson : Yes. And I would say, even more to come as we have now began to digitize our entire from prospect to servicing all of our interactions with our clients. In 2023, we captured 158 years of call interactions. Now that means, we took the calls, they were recorded. They were transcribed. They are now sitting in a data model where we can use that to do. And then another 250 years of calls in electronic communications between chat and e-mails that we have between the clients and all of that data is being used to analyze what are our clients asking us, why are they asking us and how do we avoid the meeting to ask us, those questions to start with. So you do that math there, that's the scale of the data set that we generated in one year by digitizing and leveraging data and AI in our service area. That service alone, by the way, that doesn\u2019t include the millions of SMB companies that we engage in our prospecting and sales process through the years. David Togut : Understood. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Yes, good morning John and Bob. If we took a step back at FY '25 and looked at the growth model for the company, I always used to think about net client growth, pace for control, price and the ancillary sales. And on those factors, would you say price is more historical, are we still at a point where you're getting a little bit better price? And then on the [semi or control] (ph), since they\u2019ve been so strong or likely flat. So if you kind of look at that growth model, how would you say things have -- are different than historical? John Gibson : I would say, there are similar to historical, Kartik. I mean, if you were to kind of break down the components of it and look at the guide ex ERTC. We've talked about pricing has been a little bit higher in the last couple of years. I'd say that's getting back in our expectation is that gets back more towards normal levels. The checks per client, and that's been an up and down thing over the last couple of years. And right now in the plan, we're not really assuming a lot of growth. We really have that flattish. And then when you look at maybe some of the larger client size, where we refer to kind of change in base in our HR outsourcing models, we typically see growth there. We had a couple of challenging quarters this year. John mentioned it. We actually saw that turnaround a little bit in Q4. Hopefully, that continues. We have a little bit of growth assumed there. I'd say it's probably -- we're a little cautious there given the macro uncertainty and maybe have dialed that back a little bit relative to where it is been historically. But right now, we are not expecting a big impact positive or negative, what's assumed in the plan, as it relates to macro and employment in those type of things. So I think our growth formula is strong and what's assumed in the plan next year is in-line with where it's been historically? Bob Schrader : Yes, Kartik, I think we talk a lot about what you realize from client base growth. What do you realize from price? Remember, we got a pretty broad growth formula. And when you look at product penetration, that's been an area that's been historically very strong. And I would say that accelerated during the pandemic. So if I look pre-pandemic to post-pandemic and say what changed. We're exiting the pandemic and entering the post-pandemic era in a stronger position as a company. And we are more profitable, I think we are more agile. We have a stronger value proposition and set of solutions. I think we've established ourselves as a trusted adviser with our clients. I mean we got over -- we had over $90 billion of money in our clients' hands from ERTC and PPP. And so that built up a lot of goodwill. So when I look at what we can do from an insurance penetration of what we're seeing in the PEO. Remember, we sell the PEO both inside the base and outside the base, and we are seeing both of those accelerate. We are seeing our HR outsourcing inside the base. We are seeing 401(k) inside the base accelerating. So that product penetration is something -- sometimes gets left out, and that's also a key part of our growth formula as a company and has been for, as you know, for 50 years. Kartik Mehta : And John, just a last question, just on acquisitions. You mentioned earlier in the call, the ability to provide clients with access to capital. I'm wondering, as you look at maybe acquisitions, is the thought that you'd want to continue building on that? Or would the strategy be to acquire other types of companies? John Gibson : Well, let me talk about M&A in general. I\u2019d say, another part of our growth formula has been historically M&A as well, and that would be one that we continually looked at. I would tell you that I do find the market getting back to more rational valuation, both directly in our space and then that the adjacencies that we have been looking at historically where I think there was a lot of inflation as I see this go back. We're going to continue to be very active in that market. Specifically, in the area you're asking the question, we are more interested in expanding our partnerships with Fintechs and other companies digitally, so that as the client comes into run their pay. Remember for most small business owners, the biggest check they're going to write every month is their payroll. And so that's a source that if we can provide them alternatives to float some of that or get a loan if they need to repair a truck or something like that in their business. So what we are trying to do is build more partnerships there so that we can actually give them access to capital at the point of funding their payroll. Kartik Mehta : Okay, thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our last question from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Scott Wurtzel : Hi, good morning guys. And thanks for squeezing me in. Just wanted to go back quickly to the cost optimization charges. I'm wondering if you can maybe provide a split out between the real estate optimization, the shifting of technology investments and the headcount actions would be appreciated. And then also are you expecting any incremental charges related to these in fiscal '25 as well? John Gibson : Yes. So to answer to the second question is no Scott, I think we have all that behind us. It is $30 million, I'd say roughly 20% of that is probably head count related, and then the balance from there is probably split roughly half between the real estate assets and the technology assets. There'll be some more disclosures when you see our 10-K in a couple of weeks around that. But that's the rough breakdown of those costs. Scott Wurtzel : Great. Thanks guys. John Gibson : Okay, Madison, let\u2019s wraps it up. Operator : Yes. That concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to John Gibson for closing remarks. John Gibson : Okay. Thank you, Madison. At this point, as we close the call, if you're interested in a replay of the webcast, it will be archived for approximately 90 days. Again, I want to continue to thank each and every one of you for your interest in Paychex. And I hope everybody has a great day and a great fourth of July. Take care. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's fourth quarter 2024 Paychex's Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

After the speakers\u2019 opening remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob Schrader, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Bob Schrader : Thank you for joining us for our review of Paychex first quarter 2025 financial results. Joining me today is our CEO, John Gibson. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2024. You can access our earnings release and investor presentation on the SEC's website, as well as on our investor relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC in the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90-days. Today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ from our current expectations. During our call, we will also reference some non-GAAP financial measures. A description of these items along with our reconciliation of the non-GAPP measures can be found in our earnings release. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Gibson. John Gibson : Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start today's call with an update on business highlights for the first quarter and then turn it back over to Bob for our financial update and then of course we will open it up for your questions. As we enter the post-pandemic era of Paychex, we are off to a good start in fiscal year 2025 with total revenue growth exceeding expectations during the first quarter. Excluding the impact of the non-recurring benefits from the ERTC program and having one less processing day in the quarter, revenue growth was 7%. As the best operators in the business, we also delivered earnings per share growth despite these headwinds through strong expense discipline. Small and mid-sized businesses remain resilient as the U.S. labor market gradually returns to its pre-pandemic level. While growth and hiring has moderated, hiring within our client base during the first quarter was positive and better-than-expected across our HCM and HR outsourcing businesses. We continue to make investments and transition our go-to-market capabilities and product suite to meet the post-pandemic market and drive continuous innovation in our technology and advisory solutions. We are excited to launch several new products that are specifically designed to address a constant challenge for small and mid-sized businesses, and that simply is finding and retaining qualified employees. Our Paychex Flex Engage offering, combined with Paychex Flex Perks, which was named a top HR product of the year by HR Resource Executives Magazine, and the recently announced Paychex recruiting co-pilot, are digitally and AI-driven solutions designed to help our clients succeed and win the war for talent in a very challenging labor market. These are examples how we are constantly looking for ways to bring enterprise solutions to the SMB market to really level the playing field. Flex Engage is a comprehensive digital solution with generative AI capabilities to help businesses manage their workflows, promote communication within the organization, and increase collaboration between employees, many of whom are remote. Since its launch, we have seen interest from businesses across the spectrum of industries and size groups. Our award-winning Paychex Perks offering is a digital marketplace that provides employees access to affordable benefits and discounted products and services. Paychex Perks is attractive to employers as it is available at no cost to the employer and the payments are processed automatically through payroll deductions by the employees. This allows us to establish a long-term customer relationship with our clients' employees. Our initial and launch includes 17 unique products ranging from voluntary lifestyle benefits to early wage access. We will continue to be opportunistic when considering adding other products and services to our marketplace. This new capability, which we have been investing in for years, allows us to engage our clients\u2019 employees with AI-driven offerings that meet their specific needs in our Flex HCM app. It also opens up an exciting new market for us, and is another example of how we are helping small and mid-sized businesses compete for talent against larger companies. Recruiting as we all know is a costly and time-consuming process. According to a recent Paychex customer study, 80% of respondents reported that finding qualified candidates is challenging. Last year we launched a new program in our PO called the Employer of Choice Playbook, which was designed to help our customers find qualified candidates. We are excited to add a new solution to the playbook not only for the PO, but also all Paychex customers and non-Paychex customers with a recent announcement of an AI-assisted recruiting tool for small and mid-sized business owners and HR professionals called the Paychex Recruiting Copilot. We believe this new solution will revolutionize the recruiting and hiring process by enabling Paychex customers to quickly find top talent instead of relying solely on traditional recruiting methods. Paychex recruiting co-pilot analyzes millions of potential employees through a natural language search engine to quickly produce an active list of qualified individuals for open positions based upon numerous requirements and other attributes. This puts advanced technology that is often only available to enterprise level organizations or large professional recruiting firms into the hands of small and mid-sized companies, so they can more effectively compete for talent. As you know, Paychex has a long history and experience with AI, and we believe generative AI offers an entirely new set of opportunities. We have a large and growing data set which we believe provides us with a significant competitive advantage in the years ahead. We have tens of millions of interactions with our clients and their employees every month. We have predictive and AI models deployed across the company with a focus on sales and service and the ability to deliver actionable insights based upon our vast data set to help our customers succeed. Paychex is uniquely positioned to be a leader in bringing the power of AI to small and mid-sized businesses. The breadth and quality of our solutions allows us to solve problems for business owners by leveraging our best-in-class data set and HR advisory capabilities to help them win in today's economy. We continue to gain recognition for the strength of our HCM technology innovations as well. In addition to winning a top HR product of the year for Paychex Perks, which I would remind everyone is the fourth time a Paychex solution has been named for the top HR product of the year list four of the past five years. Four of the past five years. We also earned an HR Tech Award for best small business focused solution in the core HR workforce category for the fifth consecutive year from White House Research and Advisory. This is an area I continue to believe we are not getting our due recognition. Paychex was also recently included in TIME's inaugural list of America's best midsize companies based on the strength of the company's culture, business results, and corporate responsibility efforts. Paychex is uniquely well positioned to solve the problems for small and midsize businesses based upon our comprehensive suite of HCM solutions, our advisory expertise, and the insights gained from our large data set and constant interactions with small and mid-sized businesses. We remain firmly committed to our purpose of helping businesses succeed, while also making a positive impact on our clients, employees, communities, and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Bob to give us a brief update on our financial results for the first quarter. Bob? Bob Schrader : Yes, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our fiscal quarter financial results and then provide an update on our fiscal \u201825 outlook. Total revenue increased 3% to $1.3 billion in the first quarter, which reflects headwinds from the expiration of the ERTC program and having one less processing day, as compared to the prior year period. These two items impacted growth by approximately 400 basis points, which is consistent with the expectation we shared with you last quarter. As John mentioned, excluding these headwinds, total revenue in the quarter grew 7%. Management Solutions revenue increased 1% to $962 million. This was primarily driven by growth in the number of clients served across our suite of HCM solutions and higher client worksite employees in our HR solutions, as well as higher product penetration. Those items were partially offset by the ERTC headwind that we previously discussed. PEO and insurance solutions revenue increased 7% to $319 million, primarily driven by higher average worksite employees and higher PEO insurance revenues. Interest on funds held for clients increased 15% to $38 million, this was primarily due to higher average interest rates and higher invested balances. Total expenses for the quarter increased 3% to $772 million, and this is primarily due to higher PEO direct insurance costs related to growth in our average work site employees within the PEO, as well as higher PEO insurance revenues. We've also had continued investments in product innovation, AI, and our go-to-market strategies. Operating income grew 2% to $547 million with an operating margin of 41.5%. I'd like to remind everyone operating income was also impacted by the expiration of the ERTC program as well as the one last processing day during the quarter. Diluted earnings per share increased 2% to $1.18 per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 2% to $1.16 per share in the first quarter and those items were also impacted by the headwinds that we previously discussed. Now turning to our financial position. Our financial position remains strong. We ended the quarter with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $1.6 billion and borrowings of approximately $818 million. Cash flow from operations was $546 million in the first quarter, driven by net income and changes in working capital, influenced by timing. We returned a total of $457 million to shareholders during the quarter, this included $353 million of dividends and $104 million of share repurchases. And our 12-month rolling return on equity remains robust at 46%. I'll now turn to our guidance for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025. We have maintained our guidance pretty much in all of the categories with the exception of updates to our interest rate assumptions for the remainder of the fiscal year. Our outlook now assumes a total of 125 basis points of cuts to the short-term rate on a full-year basis, which directly impacts our interest on funds held for clients\u2019 revenue and other income. Our outlook also assumes a continuation of the current macro environment. Our current outlook is as follows : total revenue is still expected to grow in the range of 4% to 5.5% and I'd like to remind everyone this does include approximately 200 basis points of headwind from the expiration of the ERTC program. Management solutions is still expected to grow in the range of 3% to 4% for the year. No changes to our PEO and insurance guidance that is still expected to grow in the range of 7% to 9%. The two changes that we have in guidance, as I mentioned, are related to interest rates. The first being interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $145 million to $155 million, that's down from our previous guidance of $150 million to $160 million. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $30 million to $35 million, and that's down from our previous guidance of $35 million to $40 million. No change to our operating income margin guidance. It's still expected to be in the range of 42% to 43%. Our effective income tax range is still expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%. And despite the changes to the interest rates that I discussed are adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance is still expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7% for the year. Now turning to the second quarter, provide a little bit of color. We would anticipate total revenue growth in the second quarter to be between 4% to 5%. And this too includes approximately 200 basis points of headwind from the expiration of the ERTC program. Then we would also expect operating margin in the quarter to be -- in the second quarter to be approximately 40%. Of course, all of this is based on our current assumptions, which are subject to change, and we'll update you again when we get to the second quarter call. I will refer you to our investor slides on our website for additional information. And with that, I'll turn the call back to John. John Gibson : Thank you, Bob, And we will now open the call up to your questions. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, at this time the floor is open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Mark Marcon with Baird. Mark Marcon : Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Two questions, first, with regards to the environment that you're currently seeing. How would you differentiate the true small business market relative to the upper end of your target range, companies with 50 to say 1,000 employees? John Gibson : Yes, Mark, this is John. How are you? Mark Marcon : Great. John Gibson : So I would say this is what we're seeing pretty consistently across the board is we continue to see moderate growth both in the small and the mid-market. I would say from a demand perspective, certainly what we're seeing across the board is a lot more demand for driving efficiency or HR outsourcing. I think the pure tech play particularly up in the mid-market to enterprise, I see a little bit slower decision making going on there, but we're not seeing that in the upper end of our HR outsourcing market. So I think right now what I see across the board are businesses are trying to drive efficiency and are looking for opportunities to reduce costs in their business. Mark Marcon : Great. And then the second question is, I had the pleasure of reviewing all of your new solutions at HR Tech and the team there just did a tremendous job in terms of giving a really professional presentation. The solutions were very impressive. I was really struck by the recruiting co-pilot. The one thing that struck me also was that it seems like a lot of the tools, like for example, the flex benefits, I think would benefit every company. Some of the other tools seem to be more geared towards companies that were a little bit larger. And so what I was wondering is to what extent do you think you could become an even bigger player in the upper end of your market? Or how would you characterize where the tools are best employed? John Gibson : Yes, Mark, I think first of all, I would start with, you know, we have a very large upper mid-market business and have for decades. I think I said, I don't think we get the recognition or people recognize the strength that we have there both in terms of a capability from a technology perspective and an advisory solution perspective. I think when you step back and looked at the products and services that we're focused on delivering, we believe those things really apply across the spectrum of the markets that we serve. Finding qualified people is a problem that every small business is having, every mid-size business is having. And I think what we've had a reputation of doing, whether you look at it, what we did to bring 401(k) down to the small market, you know, over 20 some years ago. When you look at what we've done to bring an efficient, you know, PNC, workers comp programs to the small market, to do that efficiently, that's always kind of been in our DNA, so I think what we're trying to do is take what are typically tools and capabilities that are reserved for large enterprises and figure out how to economically bring those down to small business owners so they can succeed. So recruiting is a big issue. We are real excited about the copilot product. The other thing I would tell you about the copilot product is that is not just for Paychex clients. You can go on paychex.com today on our website. You can buy that digitally. You can try it for a one time or you can sign up for a subscription service. So regardless of who your HCM provider may be, we want to help small businesses grow. And so that's pretty important. The second thing that I think you would say is getting access to affordable benefits or providing affordable benefits both to attract and retain qualified employees is a problem that's always faced small and medium-sized businesses. So that's where you get into our Paychex Perks product. We already have a full suite of insurance products, as you know, both in terms of through our agency as well as in our PEO. But the Perk product, I really like it because it gives those employers who maybe can't afford to offer benefits a means to afford it. So basically the way that works is we've curated digitally a set of benefits for their employees that when their employees get onboarded into our Flex app, they're going through an open enrollment and all of these benefits cost the employer nothing. So the employer can tell a new employee, if you join me you're going to get all these benefits. And then the employee signs up for these benefits, we do the payroll deduct. Another neat thing that we build into this is the capability that if that employee leads that employer, they can continue their relationship with Paychex and will continue to collect via a credit card for those services. So again, it opens up a new market for us. So look, what we see across the board is the problems of finding and attracting quality employees, getting access to affordable benefits to be able to retain and attract those employees. And then the third thing is really around the funding area and getting access to growth capital is continuing to be a big problem not only in the small micro market, but also in the mid-market, and we're trying to address those problems. Mark Marcon : That sounds really compelling. Are you going to advertise a little bit more? Because those are compelling solutions. John Gibson : Stay tuned, Mark, but I think, as you know, we're just beginning to get into our selling season and certainly it's not a coincidence that we launched all of these products. I would say we've been working on this for what we knew during the pandemic that we were going to have to, I mean the pandemic in the -- that we were going have to come out with a different value proposition. Because what one business in the last three years isn't going to win in the next three. And it's not going to be a pure tech play, it's not going to be on bells and whistles, it's really going to be about solving problems in our estimation. And so we've been working on this for some time. You look at the Perks product, we had to really re-engineer and redesign our core product, so that we could actually create the employee to be able to be a customer of ours. Never been able to do that before. These are all investments we've been making as interest rates were going up, as we were getting the benefits of the ERTC programs, kind of, behind the scenes, we've been making these investments. And so it's not a coincidence that now that we are in the post-pandemic era, we are launching these products that I would expect as we go into selling season, you are going to hear us talk a lot about it. Mark Marcon : Thanks and congratulations on the awards. Well deserved. John Gibson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Peter Christiansen with Citigroup. Peter Christiansen : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Good morning, John and Bob. Just curious if there's any sense of how seasonal hiring is shaping up? I know it was a bit of an issue in the December quarter -- sorry the November last quarter year, any sense of how that's trending? Appreciate it. Thank you. Bob Schrader : Yes, so far Pete, I think we made reference to this in the script in the press release. Hiring within our base, both within the HCM base and then in our HR outsourcing solutions was positive in the quarter. And for the second quarter in a row, has been slightly above our expectations. We had a couple of quarters last year where things were a little bit below where we expected them to be. We tweaked that in our forecast. Again, we didn't build our plan this year, assuming a lot of growth in those areas, but for the second quarter in a row, hiring had been positive within our base and certainly running ahead of our expectations in our plan. John Gibson : Pete, I would add to that. We're working on this problem very aggressively. And what we're trying to figure out is, how do we help make sure that our clients don't have vacancies? All these things you see us doing from recruiting, we've talked about what we did in the PO. Last year you mentioned where you had some seasonal softness. We actually created a program there to go out and do that. And then with this new copilot product. So we've been aggressively trying to figure out ways that we can fill every vacancy that our clients have. As you can imagine, having 740,000 clients, all of them have two or three vacancies. That adds up to a lot of checks. And so you look at our HR consulting business, our HR consultants increase their year-over-year interactions on both hiring and retaining by 273%. So we're packaging information, we're using analytics to identify clients that we know are having turnover problems and then we're proactively reaching out to try to help them develop individualized strategies to fill those jobs. And so very pleased in this environment to continue to see that the checks and worksite employees exceeded our expectations. And we're going to continue to work on that problem. Peter Christiansen : The recruiting tool certainly sounds exciting here. Just curious if this deepens your relationship with staffing agencies. I know that's a reasonable portion of your base. Just curious if this tool has potential to broaden that exposure. Thank you. John Gibson : Yes, I don't think we designed this tool specifically for the staffing. Certainly, as you know, we do some funding in the staffing business. We have staffing companies that are on our HCM platform as a matter of fact. And we also have some staffing companies that leverage our PO as well. So this is for not only all of our clients, but this is for all small businesses. Again, I'll go out, this is a unique thing for Paychex. Not only is this going to allow us to have for the product penetration inside our base, but this is actually a way for us to begin to have a relationship with a non-Paychex payroll customer. So anyone can go on paychex.com today and sign up and search for a job today. We really want to encourage and help small businesses attract and retain employees. Peter Christiansen : That's great. Thank you. Nice execution. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Kevin McVeigh with UBS. Kevin McVeigh : Great, thanks so much and congrats on the quarter. Hey, if I think about the pacing of the Q1 to Q2 revenue, is that primarily less headwinds from ERTC, John? Or is it maybe a little bit better-than-expected client interaction or just any thoughts around that? Bob Schrader : Yes, Kevin, this is Bob. So when you look at the, I think the, you know, I've answered a lot of questions and talked to a lot of you over the last quarter about kind of the gating of the plan. And I think it was a little bit misunderstood. Probably some of that's on us as it relates to the ERTC. But when you look at the gating of the plan this year, it is fairly evenly gated throughout the entire year. So if we go back to last year, we saw momentum in the second-half of last year. We saw an acceleration of growth in the back half versus the first-half, and that really continued in Q1, extra headwinds, we mentioned revenue growth of 7%. And when you look at the gating, you know, by quarter, it's pretty much the same. You know, I know the guide implies a ramp in performance as we move through the year, but that's really, doesn't have to do with this year, it has to do with the compare of last year getting easier. So the ERTC headwind, with 200 bases on a full-year standpoint, it was pretty large in Q1. As we move into Q2, it becomes less. I mentioned that in the prepared remarks, there's about 200 basis points in Q2. It'll become less in Q3, and then it's basically zero in Q4. So I have two more quarters of having to talk about an ERTC headwind and then it's behind us. But really there's not an assumed ramp in performance in our business. We got good momentum that started in the second-half of last year, it's continued into Q1 and we expect that to continue through the balance of the year. Kevin McVeigh : That's super helpful. And then just the adjustments on the float, where was the offset? Because obviously, nice job being able to reaffirm that the margin targets, was there any offset on that or is it just where you think you're going to fall in the range? Bob Schrader : No, listen, I mean Q1 was slightly better than what we expected, so I think that gives us confidence in maintaining the ranges and we've been able to, you know, we rolled through the -- I mentioned 125 basis points of cuts. Our plan only had 25 basis points of cuts. We've now pretty much aligned with where the Fed, you know, would expect the short-term rate to be at the end of this calendar year, which is another 50 basis points worth of cuts. And then we also have another 25 basis points of cuts assumed in our back half, which is the first-half of the calendar year. But just given the momentum in the business, retention was good, losses were down year-over-year. John mentioned the demand environment being strong. We continue to see strong demand and performance in our HR outsourcing solutions and in our retirement business. We actually had three businesses during the quarter that were double-digit growers, the PEO, retirement, and then our funding business organically was a double-digit grower. So just based on the momentum in the business, the Q1 performance, we've been able to kind of cover the changes to the short-term rates and really maintain guidance. I wouldn't expect guidance to be any different part within the ranges than where we were in the beginning of the year. John Gibson : I think remember, it\u2019s -- we've got a lot of things in front of us, elections, a lot of global items, I think that we have to continue to monitor. And we're just really getting into our selling season as everyone knows. So we're off to a good start, a solid start as Bob says. We like the setup with our products. All the stuff we've been doing, set ourselves up for the close pandemic era, are in place. We've got a lot of changes we've made to our go-to-market approach and strategies, and those investments are showing good signs early in the fiscal year. And so like I said, there's still headwinds out there that we're trying to manage around as well. Kevin McVeigh : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Bryan Bergin : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to dig in a little bit on the modestly better 1Q revenue growth. You noted client hiring was better-than-expected. Can you comment on how bookings and retention, just how did those perform versus your plan? John Gibson : Yes, you know, Brian, I would tell you retention was positive. Continues to be at near record levels, and particularly in our HR outsourcing business, our client retention actually was better year-over-year as well, both controllable and uncontrollable. The latter being a good sign relative to, you know, non-recessionary types of activities, the fact that we actually have less kind of out of business and financial distress losses. So retention was solid in the quarter. Bryan Bergin : Okay, and then on PEO growth, can you remind us what makes the PEO accelerate from here as you go through the year and maybe just comment on how, from a PEO health enrollment standpoint, how the October 1 enrollment period is going versus expectation? John Gibson : Yes, Yes, so Brian, I mean, the fact of the matter is, PEO acceleration is going to happen by continuing to see worksite employee acceleration, which we continue to see. And we have solid bookings in the first quarter. Now, as you know, PEO starts off, the first quarter is important, because as you pointed out, that's a time that we roll out our new benefits plans and obviously those plans are resonating both with our clients and with the marketplace and we're through the first part of our enrollment and that enrollment is meeting and slightly exceeding our expectations both in terms of client retention, as well as participant penetration as well. So please know where we are there. We still have, as you know, more to go as we finish out January. But I would say that where we are at this point right now is where we were last year at this point. I feel really good about the setup for the PEO. Bryan Bergin : Okay, very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Tien- Tsin Huang : Thanks. Hi, Bob. Hi, John. I just want to ask on the, well definitely some good product velocity echo a lot of comments that I'm going to call, just going into the selling season, would you expect some of the new products you're showcasing to impact unit growth more or was it more about upselling and higher revenue per, just wanted to understand that? John Gibson : Yes, I think Tien-Tsin what we're trying to focus on and I'll keep going back to this. There's three core problems that we're focused on putting our energy that we think have been consistent problems before the pandemic, during the pandemic, and accelerated in post-pandemic. That is recruiting and retaining quality employees. And we believe that the solutions that we're applying in that area not only help us drive more unit growth, but we also believe that it improves our retention. That if we're helping our clients solve that problem, then that's going to help them see the value of Paychex. And if we can provide a value proposition that says, I can help you find people you have not been able to find, we think that's going to attract new clients as well. So we think it's retentive. We think it gives us an additional upsell opportunity with existing clients to add that module on. We also think it's a way to attract new clients as well. I'll remind you on the copilot, you don't have to be an existing Paychex client to buy it today. And what we certainly hope is that when you come and start using our small business recruiting tool to find individuals that you're going to get a call from one of our HR advisors and talk to you about what else we could be doing to help you engage your employees and keep them as well. So we also think that's a good thing. And then you look at the second problem that we're trying to do, which is affordable benefits. I mean, I think we still have not heard the sonic boom of the pandemic in healthcare costs. And I think a lot of the contract negotiations with hospitals and carriers, all that's coming through. And what we see from a health inflation perspective is that people are looking for someone who has the scale and the capability and the relationships to be able to help them manage costs. Now, look, we're not going to provide cheap insurers, but at least we think we can certainly help people manage over the long-term. The cost and we've demonstrated that in our PEO and our agency can do that as well. And then the third thing that we're still working on and more to come on this is trying to help our clients gain access to growth funding, one of things I would tell you that's been a headwind for us, it was a headwind this quarter, it's been a headwind for some time, is typically within our client base, our clients are adding new locations. And so that's why we get a natural growth, we call it client referrals, but it's really not client referrals. It's a client, you know, again, we deal with a lot of entrepreneurs. They open a lot of businesses. The fact that they're not adding additional size has actually kind of hurt our unit growth a little bit for several years. And I think with the Fed rate going down, that's going to help. But we've also been working with FinTechs and others, and what we want to do is create an ecosystem where we can help support our clients gain access to affordable funding to be able to grow their business. Because if they're growing their business, that's going to help Paychex. Tien- Tsin Huang : On that ladder, that's a great point because I've been attending a lot of FinTech conferences. So this concept, you mentioned earlier with [Indiscernible], the concept of maybe doing more of that directly versus with partners. Has your view changed on that? John Gibson : No, I think that what we're trying to do is create a -- think about it this way. Like in our app today, if you're an employee and you're going to onboard an employee, we want to create an onboarding experience like you would with a large company like Paychex. You're going to come in, you're going to give us your information, you're going to fill out your tax information for us so we can load you up, and then we're going to offer you an open enrollment experience to look at benefits that you can buy on your own, you don't need your employer chipping in. The same thing we're trying to do for the employer when they're going to run their payroll, because for most small businesses, their payroll is their largest expense. So what we're trying to do is set up an ecosystem that when it comes time to fund your payroll, we want to bring a set of partners right there in the app with your ability to say, look, you're pre-qualified for a $10,000 loan or you could potentially get access to funds if you needed to float your payroll for a period of time. So we're trying to create that ecosystem, nothing yet, but that's the vision we have in talking to our small business owners about how we can help them. We have a program called Paychex Promise, which for a lot of our longstanding clients that have demonstrated that they're good risks that will actually work with them a little bit on a payroll to payroll basis on what we can do. So again, it's just one of those things that we believe that we do that. It's going to attract more customers. It's going to retain more customers. And it's really addressing a critical need that the small business owners have. Tien- Tsin Huang : Makes great sense. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Unidentified Analyst : Hi everyone, it's Michael [Indiscernible] for James. Thanks for taking our question. I just wanted to go back to some commentary that you provided last quarter just in terms of, you know, some of the challenges that you maybe saw just in terms of your capacity to sort of get deals across the finish line? And how pricing and discounting is playing into that? Was that sort of one-time in nature? Did you see any of that in the quarter and how should we expect that to play out over the near to medium term? Thanks. John Gibson : Yes, I would say that the competitive environment is stable in terms of that. Certainly, it's a highly competitive environment, but I'm not saying anything relative to anything dramatically different in terms of the pricing environment. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That's helpful. Maybe just to piggyback on Bryan\u2019s earlier question, just in terms of bookings composition, if you sort of had to stratify it between two buckets, payroll and HCM versus insurance and retirement. I think insurance and retirement were sort of some of the key drivers last quarter, but sort of what's driving the relative strength now? Is it fairly broad-based and how do you think that you know, strength is going to persist over the near-term? Thanks. John Gibson : Yes, I think, what I would say, I think if demand is out there across the suite, actually when I look at proposals, our proposals in almost all segments are up year-over-year. I think there are a lot of people out there kind of shopping and working. Again, as we know, we're just entering the selling season for most of our market segments. This is when people really are making their decisions. But I do think there's a lot of people that are out there shopping and looking and comparing providers. I've seen that, I see that in the numbers that we see. And now it's just a matter of giving them the compelling value proposition to close as we get into the selling season. So I see a very stable demand environment and feel good about how we're positioned going into the selling season. But we have a lot of work to do and that's really what we're going to see over the second and third quarter. Unidentified Analyst : Appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Samad Samana : Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Maybe first just on the new kind of benefits or financial wellness solutions, could you just remind us how the monetization works there? And what type of contribution you've embedded into the fiscal \u201825 outlook? And just remind us what segment it goes into as well, and then I'll have one follow-up. John Gibson : Well, I'll describe, you know, this is something we're just beginning to launch. We've been working on it. We're only eight weeks into it. I'm pleased with the initial results. We've been testing this for a while, but it basically works like this. You're an employee of our client. You get onboarded, you're a new employee coming on. You go through the onboarding process where you're loading your address, your information, your tax information. We then put you into a traditional open enrollment screen where you then have a menu of choices both in terms of benefits, as well as our earned wage access. You sign up for those and then we deduct that from your wages each payroll. And I would say this\u2026 Samad Samana : Great, I guess. John Gibson : Go ahead. Samad Samana : Sorry, go ahead. No, no, please, go ahead. Bob Schrader : Well, just on your second part of your question, it's early innings, we do have some dollars assumed in the plan, but I would say at this point in time it's not material and a lot of that is insurance related and would hit the PEO and insurance category. But it's small dollars assumed in the plan. As John said, we're just kicking this off in its early innings, but we think it has a lot of potential. John Gibson : Yes, [Jim] (ph), I would continue to look at these types of things of being items that we look for that are not only going to increase revenue and profit, but also are going to improve our ability to attract by differentiating ourselves for new clients and creating a retentive factor with existing clients, because we're providing something that's not being offered in the market. Samad Samana : Got it. And then maybe just a follow-up, I know the last couple of quarters you guys have talked about the discounting environment and the pricing environment. So I'm curious just what you saw in this most recent quarter from a discounting perspective and the need, the frequency and magnitude that you're having to discount and just maybe what trends you've observed and if there's been any change from what you've observed over the prior couple of quarters? John Gibson : No, I would say that what we're seeing is a little more stability to what we've seen over the last, you know, probably a couple quarters. It's still a competitive environment, but what I would say it's a little more stable in terms of what we've seen. Now, I always say that we've already entered the selling season, and we'll see what things come up with. Look I do think an interesting phenomenon is running itself across our industry. It's a thing that's called profitability and so that tends to drive rationality as well. Samad Samana : I understand. Thank you again for taking. My pleasure. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Andrew Nicholas : Hi, good morning. Wanted to first follow-up on that last question, just specific to the PEO business. I want to make sure that you could speak to, like, competitive dynamics in the pricing there. It seems like some of your peers, both public and private, are talking about increased aggressiveness on the pricing front. You've had very good growth in that business now for several quarters in a row? So just curious if your comment about it being a little bit more stable also applies to that part of your business? John Gibson : Yes, like I said, I would say across each one of our business segments, I would say that, that's true, and particularly the CEO. Andrew Nicholas : Okay, understood. And then for a follow-up, just curious on the agency business or the insurance solutions business specifically, I know you've had some growth headwinds on the rate side over the past couple years, just curious if there's any signs of stabilization there or that bottoming and what that could potentially mean for growth in the back half of this year or out into future years if there's a trough in that part of the business? Thank you. Bob Schrader : Yes, I mean that's unfortunately, Andrew, that headwind continued in the Q1 on the workers' comp race side, I think if you picked up on the comment that I made earlier as it relates to the strength of the PEO business, I mean, overall the category grew at 7%, but PEO is a double-digit grower with strong sales performance retention in just overall really good strength in that PEO business. Insurance continues to be a drag on that category. So we have factored that into the plan. So I don't see a lot of risk as we move forward to what we're calling out here from a guide standpoint. But the print numbers here that don't really do the justice for the PEO business, you know, because it's combined with insurance, because it just continues to be a strong performer for us again this quarter. John Gibson : And as we mentioned, we're going to continue to innovate around the insurance business. The Perks launch is one example, extending that market now to include they need to have a relationship with our clients and employees directly. And we're going to continue to look for ways that we can expand the market opportunity for the insurance business, because certainly to the true point Bob made, the workers' comp market has been challenging for several years. We keep thinking it's going to turn around and the macros just -- are not happening. So we've got to take control of our own destiny and we're going to continue to work on that business and come up with new ways to add revenue there. Andrew Nicholas : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC. David Paige : Hi, this is David Paige on for Ashish. Thanks for taking our question. Just a quick follow-up on what was discussed a little earlier, the 5.5% year-over-year growth and cost of service revenues. What was the -- can you provide more color on what was driving that growth year-over-year? And then I guess how should we think about that line item for the rest of the year? Thank you. Bob Schrader : I mean, we don't specifically break that out and provide guidance on expenses. I would tell you, you know, between the different lines, David, you know, I think, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, expenses were up 3% in the quarter. A lot of that was driven by the performance in the PEO business, in the higher insurance revenue that we've seen. I think ex those higher costs, our expenses were essentially flat in the quarter. As John mentioned earlier, we spent a lot of time last year on our cost structure, getting our costs in line, knowing that we had a fairly big headwind this year from an earnings standpoint and margin standpoint with ERTC. So we spent a lot of time last year and obviously we announced our cost optimization project at the end of last year to really get costs in line, so we can continue to invest in the business. And I think you're seeing the fruits of those investments with a lot of the new solutions that John highlighted and that we were able to showcase last week at HR Tech and really still being able to deliver some margin expansion, you know, the midpoint of the guide assumes about 50 basis points of margin expansion, you know, enabling us to invest and deliver margin expansion in the face of that ERTC headwind, which has a fairly significant earnings headwind as well. David Paige : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Nate Svensson : Hi guys, this is Nate Svensson on for Brian. I just kind of wanted to follow-up on the margin comments there. So, you're expecting 2Q margins of 40%, maybe a little bit lower than we had expected and you still maintain the full-year guide, calling for 42% to 43%. So I know there's seasonality in the business, and the back half tend to be stronger for you guys in terms of margin, but maybe you can talk about your confidence in realizing, I guess, some pretty material margin -- sequential margin experience in the back-half, particularly as it looks like there's still going to be some ERTC headwinds in the third quarter? Bob Schrader : Yes. I mean it's really the same story as the revenue, I mean, it's really the compare margins ex-ERTC margin expansion in Q1 was about 200 basis points of margin expansion in Q1 ex-ERTC. I gave you the 40% for Q2 color, which implies a slight contraction in margin versus last year. But again, if you exclude ERTC, it's between 150 to 200 basis points of margin expansion in Q2 as well. And then obviously, the headwinds subside in the back half of the year, and that's where you get the margin expansion on a full-year basis. So similar to the revenue acceleration that appears to be in the plan. It's the same story with margin expansion. It really relates to the prior year compare. Nate Svensson : Got it. That's helpful. And then for the follow-up, you mentioned updates on the go-to-market strategy a couple of times in the prepared remarks. And I know last quarter, we talked about some -- maybe some rollout issues with the digital channel, but I assume those are behind us now. Maybe beyond that, are you starting to see some traction on the changes you made with your go-to-market approach? Are there any lessons you've learned, maybe positive proof points on the things that you've changed and some early progress that you're seeing there? John Gibson : Yes, good question. We learn something new every day on this front, which is one of the things that we're very pleased about. So I would say when I looked at the quarter, we started in the PEO a year ago, beginning some of these go-to-market, which has included a totally revised marketing and sales technology stack implementation. So think about the margin story Bob just told. We've been delivering these margins, while investing significantly and preparing for the post-pandemic world. So while interest rates were going up and we were having the benefit of the ERTC, we have been putting money into the business to prepare for what we knew was coming. And so I'm most pleased in the quarter with the results that we're seeing from these numerous investments that we proved in the PEO that we've now extended across all of our market segments. But we've changed our marketing approach. We've changed our sales technology stack. We're exceeding our expectations in these new go-to-market teams that we've put together. We've refined our segmentation. And we're going to continue to refine that. So one of the things that we're doing digitally is collecting all of our interactions, and we're looking on a daily basis about what's resonating with our clients and how our sales teams are executing. So I've been very pleased with the execution of our go-to-market transformation teams have been working on. And when you think about that, it's really about retooling and retraining over 3,000 sellers in the marketplace. And we've actually increased our segmentation. So I think a question was asked earlier about a little bit more in the mid and the upper market. We have a lot of confidence we can do that. We've actually added 100s in that particular segment. And given the results that we've seen in the first quarter and its go-to-market pilots that we've done across the various other segments, we are actually accelerating sales hiring. So we're going into the selling season, not only fully staffed, but given the results we've had, we're going to be accelerating hiring into this new go-to-market strategy. Nate Svensson : Great color. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [Owen] (ph) on for Ramsey. I appreciate you taking our question this morning. You just touched on kind of your sales team and wanted to get an update on sort of the growth drivers within Management Solutions. Just wondering if the focus has shifted a bit from new client wins to further penetration in your existing client base with the additional HCM services? Any of your expectations going forward with -- given all the new product rollouts, which you expect to lean into more one versus the other? Any insight there would be helpful. Thanks. John Gibson : No, I would say, look, our growth formula hasn't changed. It's grow clients, drive total penetration of new products, continue to innovate. So we have more products to drive into the client base, and continue to provide value to our clients, so that we have pricing capacity, the ability to pass price on. And I would say that that's been Paychex's 52-year history, and that's what we're going to continue to work against. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And just on cost of service revenues. You touched on that a bit early in the call. Just also interested on the benefit side, if any increase in cost is associated with kind of the utilization in kind of claims cost? Any color there and kind of expectations going forward would be helpful as well. Thanks. Bob Schrader : Yes. I'd just add to my comment. Overall, I think what you're seeing there is cost being driven by not so much higher claim, but really worksite employer and higher insurance attachment that we've seen over the last year. So we're exiting employee growth in the PEO was strong. That's what we're focused on is driving worksite player growth. And I think when you do that, coupled with the insurance attachment, you get some wage inflation and medical inflation, then you're able to put together a PEO business that's growing in the double-digit range like ours did this quarter and has for the past couple of quarters, and that's what's really driving the higher cost is just the performance of the business, not so much unfavorable claims history or anything like that. Unidentified Analyst : Understood. I appreciate the clarity there. Thanks. Bob Schrader : Yes. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Kartik Mehta : Hey, good morning John and Bob. Hey, John. Hey, just getting your thoughts on acquisitions versus buyback or you may be talked a lot about some of the new products you have, maybe a change of what businesses want and need. And so I'm wondering as you look forward, just your thoughts on maybe what you're trying to prioritize and how you might allocate capital? John Gibson : Yes. I'd say, Kartik, thanks for your question. Hope you are doing well. I would say that we are constantly and have always been booking. We talked about the growth formula, grow our clients, increase our product penetration, provide value, so that we can get a proper price for what we deliver for our clients and then tuck-in inorganic growth on top of that. That's always been kind of what we've looked at. I think we saw several time. The market, I would say, over the last 12-months has changed a little more rational of what we're seeing. I would tell you that our pipeline is robust at this point in time. And I think there's more rationality coming in to the industry at this point in time in terms of a willingness to look at potential combinations. I just -- I can just see it in our pipeline and the right deals are coming together. But what we're looking at hasn't really changed. We're looking at opportunities at scale in our existing markets, where we can drive our advisory and really the full breadth of our services. Remember, we're just not a tech company. We have a ton of other products and services that we can bring to those markets. We're looking for opportunities to expand our product suite to ways in which we can continue to add products and services that we can sell to all of our clients. We're continually looking at digital capabilities where we could add that into our business and then looking for adjacent growth platforms. So all of those right there, what I told you, I would have said three years ago, we had a lot of interest and prices were unreasonably high for the value, and we're very, as you know, very conservative in looking at deals that we're going to do. What I've seen over the last two years is more rationality, in the last 12 months, even more rationality. And now I think more and more individuals are going at serious conversations. And so again, we're out there, we're looking, but we're going to make sure it's a smart deal and one that is going to be accretive for our shareholders long-term. Kartik Mehta : And just one follow-up. Maybe Bob, I think when you initially gave guidance, you anticipated kind of flat pace per control it seems like things are going a little bit better than you expected. Any thoughts in terms of kind of as you look out, if those expectations need to be changed or maybe feel better about the guidance for per control? Bob Schrader : Yes. I would say it's more of the latter Kartik, we feel better. Again, we -- it wasn't assumed in the plan to be a big contributor to growth. We had it -- I would say, in the checks per client part of the business on the HCM side, we had assumed it was going to be flattish on a full-year basis and it trended a little bit more positive there. So I think that gives us confidence in the guide again. We're maintaining the guide in the face of some interest rate headwinds on the top line as well. And then when we look at our bigger client sizes, particularly our HR outsourcing models, we did assume a little bit of growth there in the plan. Again, not a huge contributor to growth, but certainly expected it to be positive, and it was slightly better than where we expected to be in Q1. And I think that gives us confidence in kind of maintaining the guide and where we're at. But again, neither one of them were big contributors to revenue growth on a full-year basis. Kartik Mehta : Thanks, Bob, John. I appreciate it. Bob Schrader : Yes. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our next question from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Jason Kupferberg : Thanks, guys. Good morning. I wanted to start on the Management Solution. You give us a sense of what you'd expect for second quarter growth there. I know you will still have the ERTC headwind, but you won't have the processing day headwind? And then just any comments on visibility on the second-half acceleration implying the guide? It doesn't sound like you're coming in improvement in underlying performance, but just any other color on that aspect, too? Thanks. Bob Schrader : Yes, Jason, I mean, I think you might have asked me a similar question last quarter, I could be wrong. But I don't want to get into giving quarterly guidance, particularly on the split. We're trying to maintain our approach, which is to provide annual guidance and provide updates quarterly. I try to give you guys a little bit of color on the next quarter to help you out with your model, but I don't want to get into the specifics. As I mentioned, we'd expect the Q2 to be 4% to 5%. The headwind is in Management Solutions. It's ERTC, it\u2019s 200 basis points on total revenue. So I'd like to kind of stick to that. And again, I'll just reiterate my prior comments as it relates to the acceleration in the back half. When you look at the gating by quarter, and you exclude the ERTC headwind, the gating by quarter from a growth standpoint is very consistent quarter-to-quarter and is in line with kind of where we were exiting last year, which again was an acceleration versus where we were in the first-half of the business. So again, we feel like we got a lot of positive momentum in the business. Lots of great things to talk about, certainly from new product and solution introductions that have rolled out here in the last month or so, and we expect that momentum to continue through the balance of the year. But there really is not an acceleration assumed, it's really the compare last year that makes it look like the growth accelerates in the back half. Jason Kupferberg : Okay, understood. Just on operating margins, I think you came in above the guide for the first quarter. Were there any expense timing dynamics there or other factors? I mean, I know you're in the full-year outlook. Bob Schrader : Yes. I mean I'd say a couple of things. I mean revenue was a little bit favorable to our expectations. So that certainly helps. And hey, we put together a plan, and when we look at expenses, we have investments that we want to make, headcount that we're adding, and maybe that takes us a little bit longer than what we assumed in the plan, like we thought we were going to get it in the first month, and it takes a little bit longer. So I'd say we had a little bit of expense favorability, a little bit of revenue favorability. And those two things combined, provide a little bit better margin than what we had guided to. Jason Kupferberg : Okay. Thank you, Bob. Bob Schrader : Yes. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our final question from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Scott Wurtzel : Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just wanted to touch on the two key margins guidance a little bit more. I know we touched on sort of the cadence for the full-year. But just kind of looking, obviously, guidance implies a similar year-over-year change, I guess, relative to what you reported in the first quarter, but we have a little bit of improving or better ERTC headwinds? Just wondering if there's any kind of items we should think about with respect to the 2Q margin? I understand we're going to get to the selling season, if there's any items around that or others that we should be contemplating? Bob Schrader : Yes. I think if you look at the gating of the margin throughout the year, it's not exactly the same quarter-by-quarter. I think someone had referenced it's higher in the back half. It's typically higher in Q3, because of some of the year-end processing that is high margin that occurs in that quarter. But I would say nothing specific to call out, Scott, other than the guide implies a slight contraction versus prior year. But again, that's really coming from the headwind from ERTC. When you exclude that, you're seeing good margin. And we'd expect to see good margin expansion in Q2 between 150 basis points to 200 basis points. I think if you did the math, that's what you would get to if you exclude the ERTC headwind. But nothing specific to call out. Yes, we're going into selling season. I want to make sure we're gearing up, and we feel like we're in a good position, fully staffed and making the investments, so we're going to have a successful -- so we can have a successful selling season. Scott Wurtzel : Got it. And then just a follow-up. I mean, I'm just looking at the presentation, you called out high-single-digit growth in HR outsourcing WSEs, which seems pretty impressive. And I just want to maybe understand the drivers there a little bit better? And if you can talk about maybe some of the that you saw in the ASO business during the quarter would be very helpful. John Gibson : Yes, I would say that what's driving that is the power of the value proposition. Like I said, I don't think at one, the last two years in our industry is going to be what is going to end in the next two years. And I think it's not about the bells and whistles. And I think when you look at our comprehensive HR Outsourcing offering and the assistance that we provide that's beyond just the tech play, that proves to be resonating. And I do think the outsourcing message of PEOs once again, we're building back. If you remember what is a page where ASO was a little more tilted than PEO. We now see that pull back to the PEO value proposition and the team has done a great job of putting together a powerful a set of, I think, benefit offerings and execution in the PEO market. So that's been what's driving this exciting PEO growth. Scott Wurtzel : Got it. Thanks, guys. John Gibson : Scott, thanks. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. John Gibson : Okay. Well, listen, thanks, everyone. At this point, we're going to close the call. If you're interested in a replay of the webcast, it will be archived for approximately 90-days. Again, I want to thank you for your interest in Paychex, and hope everyone has a great day. Operator : That concludes today's first quarter 2025 Paychex Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
