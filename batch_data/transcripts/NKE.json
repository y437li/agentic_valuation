For those who need to reference today's press release you\u2019ll find it at http ://investors.nikeinc.com. Leading today's call is Kelley Hall, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations. Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, discounts and returns, which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE Inc's continuing operations including equipment; Nike Golf, Converse and Hurley are not included in these future numbers. Finally participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures including references to wholesale equivalent sales. References to total wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the current brands owned by NIKE Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results. Participants may also make reference to other non-public financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures. Discussion of non-public financial and statistical information and presentations of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations can be found at NIKE's website http ://investors.nikeinc.com Now, I would like to turn the call over to Kelley Hall, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations. Kelley K. Hall: Thank you, operator. Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today, as we discuss NIKE\u2019s fiscal 2014 first quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today\u2019s call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago and at our website investors.nikeinc.com. Before we begin our prepared remarks, I would like to take a few minutes to highlight changes to our segment reporting structure for FY 2014. Starting with Q1, we\u2019ve changed our reporting structure for Other Businesses. First, Hurley and NIKE Golf are now included in our NIKE Brand geography results. This reflects changes we\u2019ve made to integrate Hurley into our Action Sports category and optimize our golf business across our NIKE Brand geographies as part of our Category Offense strategies. Second, we will be separately presenting the financial results of Converse. Converse is a key part of our continued growth strategy and this change will provide additional visibility to its financial performance and contribution to NIKE, Inc. For your benefit, we\u2019ve posted a new schedule on our website at investors.nikeinc.com that provides comparable FY 2012 and FY 2013 quarterly revenues and EBIT reflecting the reporting changes we\u2019ve made in FY 2014. With that, let me now introduce the participants of today\u2019s call. Joining us will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker, followed by Trevor Edwards, the new President of the NIKE Brand; and finally you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event, you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we would do our best to get back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I will now turn the call over to NIKE Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker. Mark Parker : Thanks Kelley and hello everyone. 25 years ago NIKE launched its first \u201cJust Do It\u201d ad. Those are three simple words that remain a rallying cry for people striving to reach their full potential. It's a source of inspiration for me, this company and for consumers all over the world. It\u2019s that no excuses voice of the athletes that's really driven the success of this company from the very beginning. And it's what motivates us to achieve even more as we move forward. Last quarter, I told you what to expect from NIKE in fiscal 2014. I said we were set to grow, that we would push ourselves and our partners to better serve the athlete and consumers, because that's how we will reach our full potential and deliver more value to shareholders. Looking at Q1 results, I would say we're off to a great start. NIKE, Inc. first quarter revenues were up 8%, gross margins grew 120 basis points better than projected and diluted earnings per share increased 37% to $0.86. These are outstanding results and they demonstrate our ability to grow and more specifically that NIKE is able to generate profitable sustainable growth. So how are we able to succeed in a challenging global economy? By focusing on the fundamentals, the competitive advantages that help us win and expand our leadership position. And today I want to highlight three, our ability to innovate, the power of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio and our ability to continue to make meaningful connections with consumers. So let\u2019s take a look at the first one, our ability to innovate. It\u2019s what fuels our growth and it always starts with the athlete. How can we make the athletes faster, stronger, better and help them push themselves to new levels of performance. In Q1, we launched a whole array of products that deliver on that promise, including, the Nike Free Flyknit, the next-generation of Flyknit products in our Running category. This shoe demonstrates how we take Flyknit and combining it with other footwear platforms, like Free in this case to continue to innovate and serve the athletes. As you\u2019ve heard me say before, Flyknit is high-performance visually iconic and manufactured in ways that reduce labor and waste. We\u2019ve seen a strong response from runners to the Free Flyknit and we look to continue to drive innovation using this revolutionary upper technology both in the Running category and beyond. The potential for Flyknit is tremendous and it\u2019s safe to say, it\u2019s going to be a big year for Flyknit. We launched the Hypervenom football boot, which features revolutionary design changes to improve the fit, touch and traction of the boot. This allows the player to have better ball control and improved agility on the pitch and as Trevor will detail, the Hypervenom has resonated with consumers making it the most successful boot launch in NIKE history. We also extended our offering of Dri-FIT Knit incorporating different knit patterns to improve breathability while maintaining a seamless construction and comfortable fit. This product is one of many that have helped accelerate our premium apparel growth. And we brought a new level of sophistication and performance to Fleece with the NIKE Tech Pack, a new line of premium apparel that deliveries better fit, breathability and comfort by leveraging construction method to originally develop for technical performance product. The Tech Pack is quickly becoming the go-to product for consumers, and will be a big driver of growth for our sportswear category going forward. This is only a small sample of our new products, we're accelerating our innovation agenda and it\u2019s paying off, and there is a lot more to come, including some real breakthroughs and game changers over the balance of this year and into the future. The second competitive advantage I want to highlight is the power of our NIKE, Inc. portfolio. We\u2019ve built the company with the focused group of high energy consumer relevant brands that create opportunity in the world of sport and youth culture. We\u2019ve leveraged these brands across geographies and categories, further dimensionalizing the business. And we create innovative products to serve the consumer in their chosen sports all over the world. The breadth and depth of the NIKE, Inc portfolio is unmatched in our industry and that means we\u2019re able to manage risk and deliver growth even when there is variability in the results of any of the individual components. We\u2019re able to leverage the strength in some areas of the business while investing in others, all with a focus on delivering sustainable, profitable growth at the NIKE, Inc. level. And our Q1 results reflect just that, we delivered a great quarter which Trevor and Don will discuss in more detail. However I would like to highlight two specific areas of our portfolio and that's Converse and China. Let me start with Converse, Converse delivered tremendous growth in the quarter with revenue up 18% and EBIT up 36% contributing incremental growth to NIKE, Inc., on top of the strong performance of the NIKE Brand. Converse is a brand that has been bringing energy and style to consumers for many years and the opportunities ahead are even greater. We continue to diversify the Converse portfolio, expand the brands reach with new market conversions, grow the DTC business and unlock growth in apparel. I see tremendous long-term growth potential for the Converse brand.  : I\u2019m seeing a whole new level of engagement with our wholesale partners, as we work together to increase store productivity by creating a [pull] [ph] market fueled by amazing products and elevated retail presentation. We\u2019re increasing the power of our Category Offense by focusing our assortment with a greater level of precision on the sports and the products that mean the most for the Chinese consumer. And in those stores that have been retrofitted to the new product assortment, we\u2019re seeing performance that significantly outpaces the rest of the fleet. The knowledge we\u2019ve have gained from these early results can be leveraged and scaled to drive significant improvements across the entire market. And together with our partners, we have a shared vision. We both know the companies that will win in China are those that build their brands, capabilities, and connections with consumers. And that brings me to the third competitive advantage I\u2019d like to talk about, and that's our ability to make meaningful connections with consumers. And that really is key, as those connections ensure we continue to be the brand of choice for consumers. We connect with consumers in a number of ways through digital, which allows us to listen to the athlete and build communities and services that help expand the experience of sport, through key events, which brings consumers together to experience their favorite sport with other as passionate as they are. And through our retail stores, where we can interact directly with our consumers as they decide, which products are best for them. A great example of these consumer connections is taking place in a market I recently visited and that\u2019s Russia. I feel great about the work our team is doing there. The energy for the NIKE Brand is incredible and that stems from the meaningful connections we\u2019re making with consumers and we\u2019re helping to increase activity levels and bring greater access to sport. Let me share a few examples from Running, a category where we\u2019re bringing tremendous energy and seeing participation levels rapidly increase in Russia. We had Run Moscow and other NIKE We Run events, which bring out thousands of runners and the summer of running digital campaign created connections that lasts long after the last runner crosses the finish line. These are just a few examples that show how NIKE is making meaningful connections with those consumers and it is really no coincidence that we see our revenues in futures growing at double-digit pace in Russia, quickly gaining share and growing the market. These are the kind of connections that excite us, our consumers and ultimately serve as building blocks to grow our business. And that brings me to the final point I want to make today, and that\u2019s how we use these three competitive advantages, our ability to innovate, the power of our portfolio and our ability to connect with consumer to build our business. We do that by focusing on the greatest opportunities for growth. Looking ahead, there are both risks and opportunities for NIKE. However, we\u2019re confident we have the strength across our brands, businesses and balance sheet, as well as a deep experience team to manage the risks and seize the opportunities. So thanks everybody and now I\u2019m happy to welcome Trevor Edwards, our new NIKE Brand President. As you know, Trevor is new to this call, but he is certainly not new to NIKE. Trevor brings two decades of NIKE experience to the role, as well as a relentless focus on the consumer and a deep knowledge of the Category Offense. And with that, I'll turn it over to Trevor to take you through the results of the NIKE Brand. Thank you.  : I\u2019m seeing a whole new level of engagement with our wholesale partners, as we work together to increase store productivity by creating a [pull] [ph] market fueled by amazing products and elevated retail presentation.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Trevor to take you through the results of the NIKE Brand. Thank you. Trevor Edwards : Thank you, Mark. As I start my new role and after more than 20 years with NIKE, it\u2019s exciting to see so much opportunity in front of us, and we are focused on realizing that opportunity. At NIKE, we always start with the consumer and as we\u2019ve shared before our Category Offense brings us closer to the consumers, it focuses our teams, and underscores our competitive advantages. Our pipeline of innovative products to make athletes better, our ability to create deep and meaningful connections with consumer and our capability to elevate and transform the marketplace creating more space and more opportunity for our brand to grow. This is the complete offense we often talk about, it is the foundation of our growth strategy and allows us to continue to drive growth in both developed and developing markets. It\u2019s a strategy that only NIKE can execute at such a global scale and it's the basis for the strong financial performance we share today. So on a constant dollar basis, NIKE brand revenue was up 7% for the quarter with growth across most of our key categories and geographies except Greater China. NIKE Brand DTC revenue increased 18% for the quarter with comp growth up 9% and online sales up 12%. And in addition our global futures grew 10%. Our strategies are working and our portfolio of businesses delivered during the quarter across product types, geographies and categories. Now let's focus on three of our key geographies. Our business in North America continues to be a tremendous source of growth for the NIKE Brand. North America provides a great benchmark what is possible around the world, we continue to deliver innovative products, we deepen our consumer connections, we elevate our distribution strategies in the market and in our largest and most penetrated market, we continue to see further opportunities to growth. For the quarter, revenues grew 9% to $3 billion and we grew in all key categories except Golf. Our two biggest categories Basketball and Running led the growth continuing their double-digit rate and it was very profitable. We continue to grow in North America, because of our focus on leveraging and integrated, yet differentiated marketplace as we consistently work to provide unique consumer experiences across wholesale, DTC and online. We are able to expand both the market and our share, this integrated approach ensures we continue to maintain a strong pool market and drive profitability. Let me illustrate with one key example, our Women's business in North America. We\u2019ve been building deep and meaningful relationships with women through our digital app called the NIKE Training Club. To date, we have 10 million downloads and 600,000 workouts every week. This virtual club creates a community of women who work out with us every single day. This past quarter, we extended the idea of the training club to launch a new retail concept for our women's business to create new marketplace capacity. This catalyzing concept started with our own DTC doors and online and will eventually rollout to our retail partners. The concept is simple and powerful one stop shopping for our running, training and sportswear needs. It's where personal training meets personal shopping and styling. It starts with great premium product from footwear to apparel, performance to sportswear with style led presentations and limited edition offerings. Next come Pinnacle Services, certified retail staff, personal stylist, and fitting room services. Finally we create community in-store studios events and our running and training clubs. This is one example of how we're continuing to capture growth opportunities in North America. Let me turn your attention now to China. As Mark mentioned, we continue to make progress against our strategic reset. However, the results in China will not always be linear. For Q1 revenue declined by 3% and our wholesale comp performance slowed this quarter. However, the subset of our apartment doors that have been retrofitted with more focused assortments are performing well and in our own NIKE DTC doors, comp growth was up over 20%. The knowledge we've gained from these early successes can and will be leveraged across the entire markets. We are fully confident and committed to the strategies that we've laid out and more than ever believe in the long-term enormous opportunity in China. I opened today talking about the consumer is at the centre of everything we do. This couldn't be more true than in China, we are the sport brand of choice and we continue to drive energy into the marketplace. Over this summer, we brought an All Star lineup of NBA athletes to China. LeBron, Kobe, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and Russell Westbrook connecting them with hundreds of thousands of Chinese consumers. Now, at the heart of our reset in China is the goal of creating more productive and profitable retail for our retail partners and NIKE. There are three core elements to these plans. First, we segment and differentiate our points of distribution to create more targeted consumer experiences and to increase marketplace capacity. Second, we are sharpening our merchandising strategies assorting at the door level focusing on the products and categories that the Chinese consumer wants most and third we are working to create more seamless operating platform ensuring we get the right product to the right door at the right time. We continue to be aggressive and take decisive action to reset this market, but we\u2019ll do it the right way, creating a foundation for long-term sustainable and profitable growth.  Finally, let me touch on Western Europe. About 18 months ago, we made a decision to reorganize our business in Western Europe, to drive a more centralized and consistent consumer experience across the geography and elevate the distribution strategies, with North America serving as the blueprint, we invested in a market reset to create a platform to capture the next wave of growth in this geography. I just got back from visiting the teams and seen the market. Great progress has been made and the teams are energized and passionate about the opportunities ahead. In the Northern territories, we are seeing tremendous results led by double-digit growth in two of our largest territories, the U.K., and along with AGS, which is made up of Austria, Germany and Switzerland. The strength of the northern territories help balance the results in the southern territories which face macroeconomic challenges. Our results in Western Europe, demonstrate that our strategies are working, there is still a lot of work to be done and opportunity to be captured, but the early returns are very positive. We see Western Europe as a strong driver for growth for the NIKE Brand for the long-term. Now let\u2019s move to the category side and start where this company started over 40 years ago with Running. Q1 marks the 15th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Running, the success was broad based in footwear and apparel with men\u2019s and women\u2019s in North America and Internationally and our future orders are up double-digits as well. We lead in Running with the launch of innovative products, Nike Free Flyknit, LunarGlide 5, Pegasus 30 and our premium apparel Dri-FIT Knit all designed to help athletes perform better and there is a lot more on stage and ready to go to deliver for the balance of the year. We continue to deepen our connection with runners at retail online and at events, our Nike Running Clubs continued to gaining popularity at the same time we are adding 100,000 new runners per week to Nike+. We also continue to elevate distribution. In our own DTC doors, we have seen strong performance in Running and the success of the Running category door like Flatiron in New York City and also Covent Garden in London. These stores validate our strategies and that wholesale were seeing results n the Running concepts like the Track Club with Finish Line that significantly outpaced the balance of their fleet of their fleet in North America. But we still have room for further penetration in North America and we are just getting started across our other geographies. The last category I would touch on is global football or soccer to many of you. Even on the back of the prior year numbers, which include the European Championship, football grew double-digits in the quarter one, with futures order book also up double-digits. With the energy around the World Cup next year in Brazil, we intend to build on our position as the leading football brand in the world. And as we\u2019ve said many times, we gain our insights from the best athletes on the planet, which allows us to deliver unparalleled innovation to our consumers globally from Rio to Paris to Tokyo.  A great example is the new Hypervenom boot, rooted in insights from the best players in the world like the Brazilian and FC Barcelona star, Neymar. We work with him and other football players to create this new boot, and as Mark mentioned, it has become the most successful boot launch for NIKE Football ever. I was in Brazil in May working with the team as part of the launch, the result was a phenomenal global marketplace execution, creating energy and excitements in all geographies. The Hypervenom is already our number two selling boot behind our iconic Mercurial boot.  You can expect to see us bring more amazing innovations, connect more powerfully with our consumers and drive more energy into the market, as we head into the World Cup in Brazil and well beyond. We\u2019re off to a great start on the fiscal year and our results show that NIKE is more than a brand, it's a portfolio of growth opportunities and we are set to capture those opportunities, because of the focus and investments we make for NIKE's long-term potential. Thanks. Now, here is Don. Don Blair : Thanks, Trevor. Earlier on this call, Mark and Trevor described how our Q1 results demonstrate key NIKE assets and capabilities that enable us to drive growth and competitive advantage. I\u2019m going to build on that by illustrating how we use those competitive advantages to create value for our shareholders. Let me start with the NIKE portfolio. As Mark indicated, our global portfolio of businesses gives us the ability to deploy our innovation, marketing and operational capabilities across the broadest range of opportunities in the industry. It also provides us with the diversification to deliver consistent growth and manage risk. Our Q1 results certainly reflect the strength of our portfolio. Revenue was higher for every geography except China as our European geographies led the way with accelerated growth in revenues and futures. Converse also posted high-teens revenue growth. On a category basis, strength in Running, Basketball and global football set the pace. And on the product side, premium performance apparel outgrew moderately priced sportswear driving higher average prices and gross margin. The second competitive edge is our ability to connect with consumers to our brands, our products and our retail presentation all through a category lens. As Trevor said, those connections have never been deeper or stronger allowing us to expand the market and gain share. They also enable us to move the consumer to more premium products and price points increasing productivity and profitability for NIKE and our retailers. You\u2019ve seen this reflected in our Q1 results as our gross margins expanded 120 basis points due in part to higher net average prices and a shift in mix to higher margin products. The third competitive edge is innovation. As Mark and Trevor both noted, innovative products such as Flyknit and Hypervenom footwear and Tech Pack sportswear apparel were examples of our innovation leadership in Q1. As we continue to invest in innovation, we expect to deliver even greater impact on revenue, gross margin and overall profitability. Underlying those competitive edges is the financial and operational discipline to allocate resources to the highest potential opportunities and maximize ROI. We demonstrated that in Q1 as we delivered record revenues in EPS, raised our overall working capital productivity and increased our ROIC to a record a 25.4%, 410 basis points higher than last year. With that introduction let me walk you through our first quarter results. First quarter revenue for NIKE Inc. increased 8% on both reported and currency neutral basis as revenue for the NIKE Brand including NIKE Golf and Hurley increased 7% and Converse increased 16%. NIKE Brand futures orders accelerated to 10% growth on a currency neutral basis reflecting a 7% increase in units and a 3% increase in average selling price. The increase was led by double-digit growth in North America and both European geographies. Weaker foreign currencies reduced reported futures growth to 8%. First quarter diluted EPS increased 37% to $0.86 driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and leverage of SG&A expenses which were flat for the quarter. On our last call, we said we expected FY 2014 growth to be significantly front loaded in Q1 due largely to the comparison to last year's heavy demand creation investment and that's indeed been the case. Gross margin for the quarter increased to 120 basis points, driven by lower raw material costs, a mix shift to higher margin products, higher average prices and lower discounts, as well as growth in our DTC business and Converse. These upsides were partially offset by higher labor costs and FX headwinds, due largely to weaker emerging market currencies. Q1 demand creation decreased 16% versus heavy investments in the prior year to support the European Championships, Olympics and product launches. Operating overhead grew 12% for the quarter, due to continued investments to support growth initiatives particularly digital and our DTC business. Other expense, net was $28 million for the quarter, driven primarily by FX conversion losses due to weaker emerging market currencies. The net year-over-year impact of these conversion gains and losses combined with the translation of our foreign earnings resulted in a $38 million downside to EBIT for the quarter. As I\u2019ll discuss in a moment, we expect FX headwinds to put pressure on the balance of year revenue and earnings. The Q1 effective tax rate was 25%, 190 basis point improvement due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on operations outside the United States. Working capital productivity continued to improve in Q1 as accounts receivable fell 3%, while inventory grew only 6% below the rate of revenue and futures growth. Closed out inventory levels are healthy, reflecting tighter management of inventory supply as well as the expansion and increased productivity of our factory stores. We will continue to monitor both the inventory on our books and at retail as we work with our retailers to maintain a healthy marketplace. Now let's take a look at our performance by segment. In North America Q1 revenue increased 9% on both reported and constant currency basis, driven by growth across all key categories except Golf including double-digit growth in Basketball, Running and Men's Training. For the quarter, footwear revenue increased 9% while apparel and equipment grew 9% and 13% respectively. DTC revenues grew 12% in the quarter driven by 5% comp store sales growth. Q1 EBIT for North America grew 26% due to strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. In Western Europe, Q1 revenue growth accelerated to 8% on a currency neutral basis. As Trevor noted, the growth was broad based and particularly impressive given the strong results last year driven by the London Olympics and the European Championships as well as the ongoing macroeconomic weakness, in the region. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue for Western Europe increased 11% and EBIT increased 25% driven by revenue growth and lower demand creation spending, partially offset by gross margin compression driven primarily by FX. Central and Eastern Europe also delivered strong results in Q1 with currency neutral revenue growth of 10% led by double-digit growth in Russia, Turkey and Poland. On a category basis revenue for Football, Running and Basketball also grew at a double-digit rate. On a reported basis, Q1 revenues for Central and Eastern Europe grew 12% and EBIT increased 50% driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and lower demand creation spending. In Greater China, currency neutral revenue declined 3% in Q1 as growth in sportswear and basketball was offset by declines in other categories. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue in Greater China decreased 1%, but EBIT increased 3% due to gross margin expansion and lower demand creation spending largely offset by investments in our DTC business. You\u2019ve heard from both Mark and Trevor about the progress we\u2019re making in resetting the market place in China. This work will take commitment and patience and we\u2019re confident the steps we\u2019re taking now will set the foundation for a continued market leadership and profitable growth well into the future. As we\u2019ve noted on previous calls, our reported futures and revenue growth for China won't always follow a smooth trajectory as we reset the market. At this point, we\u2019re expecting revenue growth in Q2 with overall FY 2014 revenues roughly inline with the prior year. In Japan, Q1 revenue increased 1% on a currency neutral basis, driven by double-digit revenue growth in football and basketball offset by declines in running NIKE sportswear in men's and women's training. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue for Japan decreased 20% reflecting the impact of the weaker Yen, while EBIT increased 4% as the drop in revenue was more than offset by lower SG&A spending and gross margin expansion. Q1 revenue for our emerging markets geography was up 5% on a currency neutral basis, driven by strong growth in Brazil and Argentina. This performance was partially offset by weaker results in Korea and more prominently in Mexico where shipping delays caused by a distribution center transition reduced our revenue. Excluding the impact of the shipping disruption in Mexico emerging markets revenue would have increased at a double-digit rate. Weaker currencies were also a significant financial drag in the emerging markets geography, reducing Q1 reported revenue growth to 1% and compressing gross margin. EBIT decreased 5% due largely to these FX headwinds and higher operating overhead, partially offset by lower demand creation spending. For Converse, first quarter revenue increased 16% on a currency neutral basis driven by strong result in the U.S. and U.K., two of our largest owned markets. On a reported basis, revenue and EBIT increased 18% and 36% respectively. The growth in EBIT was driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion due to a shift in mix to higher margin territories and products. For the fiscal year, our expectations for the underlying performance of our business are essentially inline with the guidance we gave last quarter. However, as I mentioned earlier, we expect increased currency headwinds to put pressure on our reported revenue and earnings for the balance of the fiscal year. We expect revenue for the second quarter and full fiscal year to grow at a high single-digit rate reflecting FX headwinds. On a reported basis, this would be slightly below our earlier expectations. On the other hand, we are encouraged by our gross margin performance, which exceeded our expectations in Q1. We continue to increase average selling prices by strengthening the premium segments of our business and by taking selective price increases around the world, and we are expanding our high margin DTC business. For the second quarter, we expect to see gross margin expansion of about 50 basis points driven by continued benefits from higher average prices, easing raw material costs and growth in DTC, partially offset by higher discounts to clear inventories in Mexico, start-up cost for our expanded U.S. distribution center and stiffening FX headwinds. For the fiscal year, we also expect gross margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points, a modest increase from our prior guidance as the ongoing impact of the upside that drove our Q1 results are expected to more than offset FX headwinds and labor cost inflation. For Q2, we expect SG&A to grow at a mid-teens rate reflecting shifts in demand creation facing and ongoing investments in strategic initiatives. As we indicated last quarter, there will be more volatility in the year-over-year comparisons of SG&A due to the timing of key sporting events this year and last. For the full year, we continue to expect SG&A to grow at a low double-digit rate, as we invest in our brands, DTC and Innovation. For FY 2014, we continue to expect the effective tax rate will be about 25%. Q1 was a great start for fiscal 2014 delivering strong growth in revenue and profitability. Over the balance of the year, we expect to continue to drive revenue growth and gross margin expansion, while making the investments in demand creation and innovation that will deliver sustainable profitable growth and consistent value to our shareholders in the future. We\u2019re now ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Bob Drbul with Barclays. Your line is now open. Robert Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital : Good evening. Kelley K. Hall:  Hey Bob. Trevor Edwards :  Hi, Bob. Robert Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital : Trevor welcome. Trevor Edwards : Thank you very much. Robert Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital : Good luck. The question that I have on the European business and the business in China can you talk about the macro impacting you, I mean the numbers have been very impressive and especially both Western Europe and Central Europe especially in the futures side. So is the macro a big factor there and how sustainable do you think these impressive results can be? Mark Parker : Well Bob, first of all I just want to reiterate one of the things that we\u2019ve seen over the course of years with our businesses is the strength of our business is much more a function of whether we've got the product right, the brand is strong and our distribution is really compelling than the macro. So I think we certainly have seen in Southern Europe some impact from macros, but I think our overall results in Western Europe and China is really driven by what we\u2019re putting out there in the marketplace. Trevor Edwards : Yes Bob this is Trevor obviously. And probably what I would add is that, in both of those marketplaces that we\u2019re talking about what we've certainly seen is our ability to stay connected with our consumer and build the brand has been sort of like paramount in driving the growth that we've been seeing. Certainly the thing that we're working on and did in both markets was to reset them to ensure that we continue to maintain a really strong pull in the marketplace. And we\u2019re working through that in China, but obviously we\u2019re seeing some really good results come through in Western Europe. Robert Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay and then the other question was just on the Women's business in U.S., the training business, and I think some of the legend product. Can you just talk about -- if you feel like you\u2019re getting traction there and a lot of the initiatives if you could elaborate a little bit more just in that specific product? Trevor Edwards : Yes I\u2019m actually super excited about the work that we\u2019ve been doing in the women's business. We are actually seeing some really good positive momentum as we talk about putting those new concepts into the marketplace. The things that we focused on really was first and foremost get the product right and so as you commented on the Legend Pant, we\u2019re seeing some great success with all the parts we are putting through. We\u2019re really focused at the premium end and that\u2019s been doing really well for us. We continue to connect with our consumers, obviously the Training Club is a great example of how we do that. And so the third area that we\u2019re focused on right now is really the distribution. And really making sure that now we can get \u2013 give the consumer access to that product. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve created these concepts. As these concepts get better, we\u2019ll roll them out into more of our retail stores. We\u2019re super excited about what we\u2019re seeing and the results that we\u2019re getting. Robert Drbul \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay. Thank you very much. Good luck. Mark Parker : Thank you. Kelley K. Hall: Thank you, Bob. Operator : And your next question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group. Your line is now open. Omar Saad \u2013 ISI Group : Thanks. Good afternoon. One of the themes like kind of heard throughout the call and seems to have been present the last several quarters is your own retail business really performing extremely well, not that your wholesale business is struggling, but this relative out performance really sticks out even in places like China, but also in the U.S. can you talk about this shift? How much of it is strategic that you\u2019re directing or is that where your consumer is taking you, what does this mean for some of your wholesale partners? Kind of looking at this bigger picture here, any insight you could provide, because it\u2019s pretty interesting what\u2019s going on? Trevor Edwards : Sorry Omar, great question there. I think part of it is our strategy around our DTC, we clearly use DTC as an opportunity for us to really improve our assortments to make sure that we have the best lines. And so what we\u2019re able to do is really use it as a spearhead and so what you\u2019re seeing in our DTC doors is really great performance, because we have the right assortments coming through those doors. The more we learn, the more we then take those to our retail partners. And so what we\u2019ve been seeing is our ability to drive a really integrated marketplace is really helping to drive these kinds of results. But obviously, we use our DTC as a lab, as it were and also is a way to ensure that we can get our premium products to the marketplace. Mark Parker : Yes, I\u2019ll jump into the \u2013 I have always said that focus on our DTC business, this effort to become a better retailer will make us a better wholesale partner, which is what Trevor just talked about, and I think that's really paying off. We\u2019ve learned so much as we\u2019ve committed to being a great retailer that we\u2019re applying to becoming a really good wholesale partner that\u2019s most obvious in the North America, in the U.S. market, where we are more advanced in the market segmentation that we\u2019re doing with some of our top accounts and that\u2019s the model that we\u2019re working diligently on in Europe, Western Europe, especially and then certainly in China. We are in different stages of that development. But very confident that that model will actually translate well around the world. Omar Saad \u2013 ISI Group : Thanks. And then really quick on China, as you kind of go through the reset there, how do you think about maybe reducing or resetting all those lower volume concession shops and maybe doing more of these kind of high volume, whether it\u2019s DTC or with partners? Is that the kind of shift that\u2019s necessary on the ground at retail there? Trevor Edwards : Yes. I would say that our true intent in China is to make sure that we drive a more productive and profitable retail. And we believe that you do that by segmenting the market and creating greater differentiation, I mean in the marketplace. That gives the consumer more targeted experiences. At the same time, we\u2019re working really on driving our merchandising strategies, working at the door level. So that we can ensure that the consumers are getting exactly what they need. And then at the same point, we\u2019re also looking at driving a better operating platform that allows us to get the right product to that consumer at the right time. And so that obviously doing that will create more shifts, so that we have the opportunity to go for the next wave of growth that we see in China, because we truly see tremendous potential. Omar Saad \u2013 ISI Group : Thanks, great quarter guys. Kelley K. Hall: Thank you, Omar. Mark Parker : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Robert Ohmes \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, great quarter guys. Mark Parker : Thank you. Kelley K. Hall: Hi, Robby. Robert Ohmes \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, I just had two quick questions, one just a follow-up on North America. Some of the retailers have been talking about how great their business is with you. We\u2019ve heard it start to come more from places like Kohl's and Macy's and even some of the shoes that have been highlighted, have been things like the Roshe, which is a lower price point so the ASPs still are positive and look strong in your futures. But could you maybe help us understand or is your channel distribution shifting a little bit in terms of what\u2019s leading the growth either with the family channel, or again Macy's et cetera and how that might play into the ASP outlook as we look over the next year? Thanks. Mark Parker : Well, let me just jump in and say there is no shift in our channel strategy. What you I think are seeing is a result of our focus in we often like to say our complete offense. So you see shoes like the Roshe, which has been widely successful, more accessible price point in some ways. And that\u2019s actually taking place in many, many different channels. But really it\u2019s bringing that kind of innovation to more accessible price point in general. But our fixation, our obsession on bringing performance not only to the very top of the line, but throughout the line is continuing. And I think you\u2019ll see some shifts here and there, but overall you\u2019re going to see us over the course of this coming year drive some incredible innovation that\u2019s going to keep the focus on premium and our unique position is then to draft off of that and create this complete offense down through the price points as well. Robert Ohmes \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then just quick follow-up question, small business for you, but Golf, could you sort of walk us through what's made that business weaker and when you see it turning more positive? Trevor Edwards : Yes, the issue with Golf is really \u2013 it\u2019s really much more of an operational issue that actually drove the weakness in this particular quarter. We had some supply chain challenge in Canada and that's really the impact that drove that. But other than that, the business continues and fundamentally being at really good place. So that was really just a result of just a small thing. Robert Ohmes \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks very much guys. Operator : And your next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi. Your line is now open. Kate McShane \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon. Kelley K. Hall: Hi, Kate. Mark Parker : Good afternoon. Kate McShane \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: I think you had mentioned in your comments that you saw some gross margin expansion in China and I wonder what that implies for where you are with working through your inventory in the region? Don Blair :  Well, I would go back to some of the language we used, which is there\u2019s going to be a lot of volatility in China, and I would say overall, we are continuing to make progress in managing inventory. I don't think I would read the gross margin results as any sort of milestone along the road. We are making progress. We do feel that we are getting that market set in right place. I think it's really more the broad global drivers that helped our margins everywhere. Things like easing raw materials cost, shifts and mix, those are the things that I think were the more powerful drivers of what was going on in China. Kate McShane \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.: Okay. Great and my second question is, as you reset China, is there any change in mix of product in apparel versus footwear with the changes that you\u2019re making or is the mix of products generally staying the same? Trevor Edwards :  I would say that the broader mix will probably stay the same how the mix actually affected at a store level will be different because we really are working on just making sure that we have the right assortments in each of the doors, but I think overall the mix will generally be the same. Mark Parker : Let me add that the category focus in China is going to be more intense, we\u2019re actually trying to zero-in on the shorter listed categories that have the greatest potential for growth. So we\u2019ll have the more targeted mix of products, but the ratio of footwear and apparel we\u2019re not seeing a dramatic shift in that ratio. That said see tremendous upside in the apparel business in China for NIKE to move forward and frankly around the world. That\u2019s one of the \u2013 what I would call underpenetrated segments of our business today. But no specific targeted change in the overall mix in China except for maybe more of a focus in terms of the category breadth. Kate McShane \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.:  Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Lindsay Drucker Mann \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Kate Mcshane :  Hi Lindsay. Mark Parker :  Hi Lindsay. Lindsay Drucker Mann \u2013 Goldman Sachs : On the gross margin front, can you talk about the key differences versus your original guidance that led to the upside to be versus your expectation and then as you think about the next quarter where you expect those tailwinds to moderate so that you see a little bit more modest improvement? Don Blair :  Well it\u2019s one of the things that were little better than what we expected. We did have an even more favorable product mix than we expected that was one of the pluses, we also had our investments in our North America distribution center come in a little bit later than what we had originally expected. We have had tremendous growth in North America and we\u2019ve been doing some work in our Memphis hub putting some new capacity in down there and we expected a lot of those cost to hit in the first quarter and they came in the second. So those are two other things that really shifted versus our guidance. I think if you look at the year-on-year drivers as I said, it was easing raw material costs, shifts to premium price increases. We had some great results out of Converse and DTC has been quite strong. We think those really will carry through a lot of the balance of the year plus or minus. But couple of things that are changing. We are seeing the FX headwinds get a little stiffer and we also expect that we\u2019re going to have those supply chain investments particularly in North America start to flow in a little bit later in the year. So those are really what I would call out of the major shifts from the first quarter into the balance of the year. Lindsay Drucker Mann \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay, thanks. And on the North American Direct-to-Consumer piece, can you maybe I missed it, but what was your e-commence growth in the region in the period, and can you talk about some of the initiatives you have in place to drive growth in that platform? Don Blair : Yes usually we don't give that level of granularity by geography. Overall we were up. I believe it was 12% online. And one of the things to bear in mind is we had an extremely strong year last year. So we\u2019re about 50% two year growth on the online business and we are continuing to be extremely enthusiastic about the potential for that piece of our business. Trevor Edwards : Yes, I mean I would say as Mark pointed out that's one of the most critical growth drivers for us in the future. So we expect to see continued momentum and growth in that part of the business. Lindsay Drucker Mann \u2013 Goldman Sachs :  Is there anything in terms of functionality or marketing or otherwise we can look forward to specifically in the U.S., balance of the year or in the next couple of years? Trevor Edwards : Yes, we continue to make sure that we improved the site and all the experiences. But you will kind of see those as they rolled out in the months coming up. Lindsay Drucker Mann \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay, thanks. Operator : You are next question comes from Matthew Ross with JPMorgan. Your line is now opened. Matthew Ross \u2013 JPMorgan: Yes, congrats on a good print. I wanted real quick, share repurchase was almost doubled last two quarters and you took on $1 billion of debt also in the quarter. Can you speak to the mindset around capital allocation and how should we think of this as part of the earnings algorithm going forward? Don Blair : Well, the debt issuance does not signify any change in our approach to capital allocation. As we\u2019ve been pretty consistent over the last few years that we believe we\u2019re going to be throwing off quite a bit of cash flow. We expect to be continuously raising our return of cash to the shareholders, at the same time that we will be investing in the business. And that pattern of consistent increases in cash return to shareholders as well as consistent increase investment in our business is what we\u2019ve actually demonstrated over the last decade, so no change there. The offering of debt at the time we did it, I think gives us tremendous flexibility in our capital structure and frankly those interest rates were outstanding. Matthew Ross \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay. And then more of a clarification, on your full year guidance is EPS still expected to grow at a double-digit rate for the year? Don Blair : We don\u2019t give that level of EPS guidance. We try to give people parameters to help them understand what\u2019s ahead. But at this point, I\u2019d rather stay with the guidance that\u2019s in the prepared remarks. Matthew Ross \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay. Was there any change from last quarter? Don Blair : I think the conversation was about line-item guidance and I think that's where I\u2019d like to stay on the guidance. Kelley K. Hall:  Matthew feel free to follow-up with the IR team. We'll walk you through it. Matthew Ross \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay, great. Kelley K. Hall: Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : And your last question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is now open. Jim Duffy \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus :  Thanks, hello everyone. Kelley K. Hall: Hi, Jim Mark Parker : Hi, Jim Jim Duffy \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : I\u2019m interested in some more commentary on the strategy to continue to take prices higher, have you seen any evidence of resistance to price, and has the reception to price been consistent across regions? Trevor Edwards :  I think we\u2019re looking at in sort of a really two ways right, one is sort of making sure that we have great price value in the marketplace. So we always want to make sure that each season we go in and we\u2019re evaluating the pricing that we\u2019re currently setting to make sure that we actually are taking the opportunities when that there to go back to the right price, at the same time what we\u2019re also doing is driving the change in the mix of our business. So you will see us really drive a lot of premium concepts certainly we\u2019ve seen that across the board, and we\u2019re certainly seeing really not a lot of resistance to that at all. In fact we\u2019re seeing tremendous growth around our premium businesses. So as Mark talked about process really the complete offense, making sure that we are competitive on the one side, but also taking price when the opportunity prevails itself. Jim Duffy \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : Great, thanks. And then Don so some of the increased FX headwinds seem to be from emerging market currencies does that make it more costly or difficult to hedge against the exposure? Don Blair : Well, you are exactly right. And in fact for many of those currencies it's really not very economical to hedge them, but over the last few years we've taken a number of steps to reduce our overall exposure, we have built an internal trading company we have really done some adjustments to how we source. And so we think we\u2019ve done some things that have reduced the exposure. But the currencies like the Reais, the Argentine Peso, the Russian Ruble, it's not great tools out there to economically hedge them. So to some degree, we are exposed at some level for those currencies. And what we do is we really manage our overall P&L equation across the whole portfolio. So as we talked about these adjustments are there, but we're not so exposed to anyone currency and we've got lots of levers to pool across the portfolio to continue to deliver consistent growth. Jim Duffy \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : That's helpful. Thanks, see you in a couple of weeks. Mark Parker : Thank you. Kelley K. Hall: Thanks everyone for joining us. And we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed within the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to the mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, discounts and returns which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of Nike, Inc.'s continuing operation including equipment; Nike Golf, Converse and Hurley are not included in these future numbers. Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales. References to total wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the current brands owned by Nike, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results. Participants may also make reference to other non-public, financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measure. Discussion of non-public financial and statistical information and presentations of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations can be found at Nike's website, http://investors.nikeinc.com. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Kelley Hall, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations. Kelley Hall : Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nike's fiscal 2014 second quarter results. As the operator indicated, participates on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago and at our website, investors.nikeinc.com. Joining us on today's call will be Nike, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker, followed by Trevor Edwards, President of the Nike Brand. Finally, you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I will now turn the call over to Nike, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker. Mark Parker : Thank you, Kelley, and hello everyone, and happy holidays. It's always good to finish strong, and as we reach to close of the second quarter, that's exactly what we have done. Looking at our results, you clearly see that the Nike, Inc. portfolio is a powerful engine for growth. Here are the highlights. Nike, Inc. revenues increased 8% to $6.4 billion. Gross margins came in better than anticipated, up 140 basis points. SG&A increased 14%, in line with expectations and reflecting strategic investments in our brands and operations and diluted EPS rose 4% to $0.59. As we discussed at our recent investor meeting, at no time in our history have the growth opportunities been greater for Nike. Our ability to surgically focus our resources and align our efforts across multiple areas of our business allows us to successfully invest in our biggest opportunities for profitable sustainable growth. This approach ensures we are in a strong position to manage the macroeconomic challenges when they arise and seize new opportunities when conditions improve, like now, as we see initial signs of stabilization in select national economies. Regardless of the macroeconomic conditions, we know we have to earn our leadership position with consumers every single day, and our management team has the experience to focus Nike's resources on what matters most to our consumers. With this focus we continue to increase our potential and ultimately reward our shareholders with long term, sustainable and profitable growth. As I\u2019ve said before, innovation is at the heart of everything we do. I continue to see expanding opportunities for Nike to reach new heights of product and performance innovation. We are a successful innovator because of our unique partnerships and first and foremost, with the world's greatest athletes whose insights inform our amazing products and services, but also with other partners who help us advance in areas like digital and manufacturing. Our innovation pipeline has never been deeper or stronger than it is today. Let me highlight three areas of innovation from the quarter. First, the next steps we are taking with our digital initiatives; second, our new advances in apparel; and third, our continuing efforts to revolutionize manufacturing. At Nike, digital is a powerful innovation engine. As we have discussed, our digital ecosystem has three components; consumer connections, ecommerce, and digital products and services. Together these components form our integrated digital strategy, and I continue to be incredibly bullish on digital's potential to drive both innovation and strong growth for years to come. Looking at our ecommerce business, we delivered another strong quarter with 33% revenue growth, and at less than 15% of our DTC revenues today, our ecommerce business clearly has opportunity to grow. We also expanded our nike.com footprint in the quarter, launching sites in Japan, the world's third largest e-commerce market, and in Brazil further extending our commercial reach for consumers in this key growth market. In digital products and services, we launched the next generation of the Nike+ FuelBand, the FuelBand SE. With enhanced features and services for our consumer, it reinforces NikeFuel as the global currency of movement. Given digital's tremendous potential, we will continue to invest in innovation and infrastructure to accelerate our digital strategy and capture significant growth for Nike. Turning to apparel. We delivered some major apparel innovations in the last six months. Most notably with Tech Fleece, Aeroloft and Dri-FIT Knit. And having just come back from Brazil, where World Cup fever, by the way, is already running quite high, I will touch on our World Cup related advance in apparel, and that's our new Brazilian and French football kits. Working closely with the athletes and the national federations, we designed these kits to reflect each country\u2019s rich football heritage. Insights from our athletes are reflected in the sharp attention to detail and beautiful craftsmanship. Each kit integrates technical performance innovation with team specific design elements. The kits feature Dri-FIT Knit technology, engineered mesh, and laser cut ventilation for better cooling and our lightest Nike Pro base layer ever. In fact, the uniforms are actually 16% lighter than our 2012 Euro Champ uniforms, and they are made of recycled polyester using the equivalent of 18 recycled water bottles in every kit. In the weeks ahead, we will launch eight more national team kits as all ten Nike teams, by the way, a Nike record, get ready for the World Cup. These new kits are just one example of the unprecedented level of product innovation we have planned for the World Cup. It's an exciting time as we look forward to being a part of the biggest sports event in the world. Nike's commitment to innovation extends beyond the products we design to how they are manufactured. As we shared at our Investor Meeting, our manufacturing revolution initiatives continue to challenge traditional manufacturing assumptions, so we can maximize our potential to serve athletes and further extend our competitive position. Take two examples; ColorDry and Flyknit. ColorDry is a revolutionary new fabric dying process that replaces water with recyclable carbon dioxide. Beyond the breakthrough and sustainability, this impressive technology delivers superior results with brighter and more consistent colors in the fabric. With Flyknit, we have continued to leverage its game changing potential. We have extended Flyknit across all of our running footwear platforms at Zoom, Lunar, Free, and the Air Max, and now with the Kobe 9 masterpiece, basketball is part of Flyknit's new frontier. Kobe's new shoe includes the best of Nike's technologies, not only Flyknit, but also Flywire and Lunarlon . The technologies behind these visually striking shoes provide support and mobility at the same time, and we are not done with Flyknit, not even close, we will continue to expand Flyknit across categories pushing past the boundaries of what people think is possible to deliver incredible products for our consumers. By the way, we just learned of Kobe's injury, and we want to wish him a full and fast recovery. We are also able to deliver strong results by remaining focused on the consumer and delivering innovative products into a differentiated marketplace. The strength of our portfolio allows us to leverage a focused group of high-energy brands across a globally diverse set of markets and broad range of categories. Trevor and Don will provide more specifics, but I want to highlight a few examples that reinforce the competitive advantages of our portfolio. First is Converse. With Q2 revenue growth of 14%, Converse continues to deliver great results. Converse is a global brand with a rich history, and we continue to leverage this legacy to drive growth by making Converse relevant to each new generation of consumers around the world. Next is Western Europe, where revenues grew 18% in the quarter. In early 2012, we decided to reset our strategy in Western Europe. As our second quarter results demonstrate, with the right strategy and the right execution, we can deliver tremendous results, and our futures orders of 26% demonstrate the clear momentum we have in the market, reflecting strong growth across multiple categories. As we did in Western Europe, we are also executing a reset strategy in China to reposition this critical market for sustainable, profitable growth. It's still early, but we are very encouraged by what we are seeing with China delivering 8% revenue growth and continued improvement in our key performance metrics. We have applied the insights gain from executing the category offense in North America, first to Western Europe and now in China. This demonstrates our ability to translate key strategies into locally relevant executions to unlock Nike's growth potential. In 2014, we look forward to some of the most compelling moments in sports. The Super Bowl, the Winter Olympics in Sochi, and of course the World Cup just to name a few. At Nike, events like these are inspiration points for us. These are the moments when we share the stage with the world's greatest athletes and showcase our most innovative products, the products that will go on to transcend these individual events and catalyze new momentum in the marketplace around the world. With that, here is Trevor to discuss the Nike brand. Trevor Edwards : Thank you, Mark, and happy holidays everyone. At Nike, we are crossing this quarter's finish line exactly where we always aim to be, out in front. We feel great about where we are halfway through the fiscal year, and at our Investor Meeting, I spoke about the vast opportunity ahead for the Nike brand and our focused strategy to realize that opportunity, and our Q2 results reflect those efforts. The Nike brand delivered strong results even as we continue to make strategic investments for the future. So, on a constant dollar basis, the Nike brand was up 9% for the quarter with growth across all key categories, product types, and geographies. The Nike brand DTC revenue increased 19% driven by 10% comp store growth, new stores, and the strong increase in online sales. And importantly, global features are up a robust 13%. Our strategies are working and our investments are paying off. And the reason behind this success is clear, a razor sharp focus on the consumer through the category offense. When you combine our full pipeline of innovative products, our strong connection with consumers and our ability to create compelling retail presentations that elevate the marketplace, it's a winning formula for growth. Now let's look at how that growth formula is playing out for the Nike brand starting with two of our key categories, basketball and football. Let me start with basketball. This quarter is basketball's largest revenue quarter in our long history with the game. For years, we have built deep and meaningful relationships with consumers through two of the most powerful brands in the world, Nike and the Jordan brand. Today, with basketball truly a global sport, these relationships now span the entire world. This fueled double-digit growth for the category with combined Nike and Jordan Q2 revenues growing in every single geography. We succeed in basketball for a simple reason. Our relationship with the world's best players gives us unrivalled insight that leads to amazing product innovations which fuel our ability to inspire consumers all over the globe. It\u2019s that constant innovation that strengthens Nike's position as the world's leader in basketball. With that strong sale of KD 6, the LeBron 11 and the CP 3.7, Chris Paul's signature shoe and anticipation is approaching a fever pitch for the Kobe 9 masterpiece, the first basketball shoe to use the Flyknit technology as Mark discussed. It becomes available in February. You can also see that passion coming to life in the marketplace. Retail destinations, like our own DTC stores or our House Of Hoops with Foot Locker continue to be the go-to places for consumers who live and breathe basketball, in the U.S. and increasingly in Europe. These category focus shopping experiences are a great example of our growth strategy. A focus on the consumer and elevation of the marketplace and the delivery of a superior brand experience. Now let's talk about the world's largest game, global football. Our business in this category continues to accelerate and with the World Cup just six months away, we will strengthen our position as the world's leading football brand. I feel very confident about our position heading into the World Cup. With 10 teams and the best lineup of products that I have ever seen, I can tell you, it will be an incredible time for football and for Nike. Above all else, the World Cup let's Nike showcase our game changing product innovations on the global stage. We have already launched an incredible number of products over the last six months alone, starting with the Hypervenom, our most successful boot launch ever. We followed that up with the Hi-Vis 4 Silo, which has a beautiful aesthetic [ph] that enhances the player's ability to see teammates quickly and make critical plays when seconds count. We also launched the new national team kit for France and the five star champion Brazil and there is still so much more to come. This unmatched pace of innovation and brand energy will continue to drive our growth in this category in the years ahead. Last month, I was in Rio when we launched the new Brazilian team kit and I can tell you the excitement was amazing. The full day of celebration was a tangible expression of Brazil's love affair with the sport. It was a true privilege to witness this shared moment of national pride as we unveiled the team kit. The electric atmosphere also included the Run Rio 10K and a concert on the beach with tens of thousands of people all there. It was an unbelievable experience that only Nike could deliver. After all, Nike is in the business of making big moments bigger. These are the meaningful experiences that makes the connection of the Nike brand personal for consumers and expand our business potential in key growth markets around the world. Now, let's focus on our key geographies, starting with the emerging markets. Our Q2 revenue in the emerging markets increased by 3%, well below what we would have expected for this key growth geography, while we had strong growth in nearly every territory, these results are largely offset by a specific significant logistical challenge in Mexico. In June, we transitioned to a third-party logistics provider in Mexico. The transition did not go as smoothly as planned. As a result, shipments from our distribution center to our wholesale partners were delayed leading to a buildup of inventory in the distribution center and a shortage of Nike product in the market. We are working with our third-party logistics provider to resolve the issue and expect to be shipping to demand by the end of Q3. As we continue to manage through this logistical issue, we are actively engaging our wholesale partners to ensure the appropriate flow of goods into the marketplace. However, we believe, it will take a few quarters for us to fully regain our business at retail and address residual inventory issues. Despite these short-term challenges, the Nike brand continues to lead in Mexico and the emerging markets overall. Future orders are strong and we remain confident in the long-term potential of this key growth geography. Now, let's turn to North America, which continues to be a great example of what the Nike brand offense can accomplish worldwide. In Q2, revenues grew 9% and reported EBIT grew a double-digit for the sixth quarter in a row. The category offense remains a powerful strategy for driving growth and profitability in North America. By offering an unparalleled consumer experience across wholesale, retail and online, we expand both, the market and our share. This approach drives consistent expansion in our largest categories like running and basketball and allows us to aggressively attack our biggest growth opportunities like our young athletes and our women's businesses. Let me take a second to discuss the last two. In our young athletes business, we are seeing tremendous momentum with double-digit growth in Q2, which we expect to accelerate through new retail concepts with our wholesale partners like the Nike Fly Zone at Kids Foot Locker, and in women's business, as we discussed at our recent Investor Meeting that Nike training club has helped us build meaningful relationships with women. We have used this knowledge to create a unique consumer experience in our own retail location and I am pleased to report that our result continues to be very strong. Our women's business in the Nike training club outpaces our other retail doors strong double digits, and because of this response, we are expanding beyond the 20 doors we launched in August and plan to have over 40 Nike NTC doors by the end of this fiscal year. Overall, we continue to see clear opportunity for growth in North America, as we focus on the needs of our consumers and deliver innovative product in compelling retail experiences. Now, let's look to China. For Q2, revenues increased 5%, driven by strong growth in basketball and running. We are confident of our strategy will set the foundation for sustainable, profitable growth in China over the long-term and we are making good progress. First, we are segmenting and differentiating our points of distribution to create more focused consumer experiences and to increase the market capacity. Our leadership position with the consumer lets us offer innovative, performance-led through more compelling retail experiences. Second, we are sharpening our merchandising strategies. We have recently tested four new concepts in our DTC stores and with our wholesale partners, including new fixtures and a more refined merchandising. Third, we continue to work with our wholesale partners to create a more seamless operating platform, ensuring we get the right product to the right door, at the right time. While we are still relatively early in the reset process, the results are very encouraging. Comp store sales in our DTC stores were up over 20% in Q2, and our wholesale partners are seeing improvement in those stores that have been re-profiled. In these stores, revenue and sell-through rates are above fleet averages and inventory levels are improving throughout the marketplace. By focusing on increasing retail productivity, we will continue to grow the profit pool and put ourselves in a position for renewed, sustainable growth in China. Finally in Western Europe, we delivered a great quarter with 15% revenue growth. About two years ago, we made the decision to put a new, more centralized organizational structure in place to better manage key partner relationships and accelerate the implementation of the category offense in Western Europe. That decision is delivering tremendous results. Key territories such as the UK, Northern Europe and AGS, which comprises Austria, Germany and Switzerland, are showing incredible growth in both revenues and futures. And as is the case elsewhere for the Nike brand, we are leading with performance, showing real strength in Running, Basketball, Football and Women's Training. And we have seen double-digit DTC growth and strong growth with our wholesale partners, driven by new category experiences that bring the power of the Nike brand to life in the marketplace. Examples include the House of Hoops with Foot Locker in the UK or shop-in-shop executions with Karstadt in Germany or Futbolmania in Spain. As our results demonstrate, the category offense is having a significant impact on our business in Western Europe, and there are still considerable opportunities ahead. Our results this quarter prove that by focusing on the consumer, we will continue to build our business throughout the many growth opportunities worldwide. The strategies and investments we create that are critical for the strong foundation and we will make the most of those opportunities, now, and in the years to come. Thanks, and here's Don. Don Blair : Thanks, Trevor and Happy Holidays, everyone. I would like to begin by highlighting three competitive strengths that underpin our Q2 results and give us confidence in our ability to deliver profitable growth and consistent returns to shareholders. Let's start with our focus on the consumer. As Trevor discussed, in Q2, the Nike brand delivered growth across each of our geographies, product types and global categories. The key driver of that success is our category offense. We first saw the power of the category offense in North America, which delivered mid-teens revenue and EBIT growth over the last three fiscal years. More recently, the work we have done to implement the strategy globally is accelerating growth in other markets, most recently in Western Europe. These results underscore our confidence that the category offense will drive profitable growth in other key markets such as China and Brazil. By focusing more sharply on the consumer, we have improved our ability to deliver relevant product innovations, deeper brand connections and compelling retail experiences. The result is incredible topline momentum as well as the product and brand separation that enables premium prices and gross margin expansion. The second strength is the Nike Inc. portfolio. For a global business spanning 190 countries, there will always be unforeseen macroeconomic and operational factors that affect our business. The breadth of our portfolio, the capabilities of our operating platform and the strength of our balance sheet, give us the tools to manage the impact of these factors on our consolidated results and the depth of our management team gives us the ability to use those tools to deliver sustainable growth in profits and cash flows. That brings me to the third strength, which is our ongoing commitment to investing for the future and delivering near term profitability. So far this year, we have delivered strong EPS growth and return on invested capital reached a new high increasing nearly six points to over 26%, and in the first six months of the year, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders, through share repurchases and dividends. We were able to deliver these returns because we have invested in growth strategies such as product innovation, digital infrastructure and marketplace development both wholesale and DTC and we will continue to invest in those strategies, allocating resources to the highest potential opportunities to maximize returns. With that introduction, let's recap our Q2 results. Second quarter reported Revenues for Nike, Inc. increased 8%. On a currency-neutral basis, both Nike, Inc. and Nike Brand revenues increased 9%, while Converse increased 11%. Also on a currency-neutral basis, Nike brand futures orders increased 13%, driven by a 10% increase in units and a 3% increase in average selling price. Futures for most of our geographies increased at a double-digit pace, driven by strong demand across multiple categories, including global football, sportswear, running, basketball and women's training. On a reported basis, futures grew 12%, reflecting weaker international currencies. Second quarter diluted EPS increased 4% to $0.59, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate, partially offset by higher year-over-year SG&A investments and stiffer FX headwinds. We have discussed the phasing of SG&A spending on previous calls. As a result of the timing of investments in FY'13 and FY'14, we expected FY'14 EPS growth to be significantly front-loaded in Q1, with lower growth over the balance of the year. We have also discussed the significant impact of weaker international currencies, which reduce our gross margin and erode the U.S. dollar value of local currency profits. We estimate changes in currency exchange rates reduced our EPS growth by about 10 percentage points for both, the second quarter and year-to-date. As we have noted on previous calls, we expect FX headwinds to continue to pressure balance of year earnings growth. Gross Margin for the second quarter increased 140 basis points. The favorability was driven by a mix shift to higher margin products and businesses, higher average prices and lower raw material costs as well as the continued strength of our DTC business. These positive factors were partially offset by higher labor costs and continued FX headwinds, due largely to weaker developing market currencies. As expected, Q2 SG&A spending rose at a mid-teens rate, with demand creation increasing 13% and operating overhead up 14%. Second quarter demand creation spending was higher to support new product launches, including the World Cup kits and FuelBand SE that Mark mentioned, as well as global running events and the ramp up to the Winter Olympics. The increase in operating overhead reflects targeted investments in long-term infrastructure and capabilities, growth in our higher gross margin higher cost DTC business, as well as continued investments in digital. Other expense net was $13 million for the quarter, driven primarily by a charge related to an adverse legal judgment in Western Europe. The Q2 Effective Tax Rate was 25.1%, a 170-basis point improvement versus the prior year, due primarily to an increase in earnings from our operations outside of the U.S., which are generally subject to a lower tax rates. Q2 inventories grew 11%, below the rate of futures growth. Inventories are generally in good shape, though we are continuing to work through pockets of excess inventory created by distribution center issues in Mexico and some slow moving footwear styles in North America, most notably a line of retro training footwear. With our well-developed liquidation channels, we are confident we have the appropriate plans in place to address these situations. Now, let's take a look at some performance highlights by segment. In North America, Q2 revenue increased 9% on both, the reported and constant currency basis, driven by growth across all key categories, including double-digit growth in basketball and women's training. For the quarter, footwear revenue increased 10%, while apparel rose 9%. DTC revenues grew 12% in the quarter, driven by 7% comp store sales growth. On a reported basis, Q2 EBIT for North America grew 15%, due to strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion. In Western Europe, Q2 revenues increased 15% on a currency-neutral basis. As Trevor discussed, we continue to be very pleased with the growth of our business in Western Europe, following our strategic reset in 2012. Growth continues to accelerate at an impressive rate, led by double-digit growth in Sportswear, Running, Basketball and Women's Training, as well as in our Young Athlete's business. Territory performance was led by the UK and AGS, with revenues increasing over 20% in each territory. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue for Western Europe increased 18% and EBIT increased 12%, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by the legal charge I mentioned earlier. In Greater China, currency-neutral revenue grew 5%, led by growth in Basketball, Running, Sportswear and Global Football. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue in Greater China increased 8% and EBIT increased 5% as revenue growth was partially offset by investments in our DTC business. As both Mark and Trevor indicated in their earlier remarks, we have seen encouraging results in partner stores we have reset with more focused assortments, and Nike DTC stores continue to perform well, with comp store growth over 20% for the third consecutive quarter. These results are an indication that our strategies are the right ones and we are now working with our retail partners to refine and scale them. As we have said previously, our futures and revenue growth for China won't necessarily show sequential improvement every quarter as we move through this transition. While we work with our retailers to manage the marketplace with greater discipline, year-on-year changes in cancellations, returns and discounts will create volatility in revenue growth and disparities between futures growth and revenue growth. At this point, we continue to expect overall FY14 revenue to be roughly in line with the prior year with single digit revenue growth in Q3 and flat to down revenue in Q4. Revenue in the emerging markets geography grew 3% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by higher revenues in nearly every territory and double-digit growth in the largest territory, Brazil. Although revenues for the geography were above the prior year, the rate of growth was significantly below the rate we would expect, driven primarily by the impact of ongoing supply chain challenges in Mexico. On a reported basis, revenue in the emerging markets declined 4% and EBIT decreased 18% due to the adverse impact of FX headwinds on gross margin and translation. The decline in EBIT also reflected increased demand creation investments in advance of the World Cup and higher operating overhead for new retail stores and the launch of nike.com in Brazil. Converse revenue grew 11% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by continued strength in our largest owned markets, North America, the UK and China. On a reported basis, revenue increased 14% while EBIT grew 10%, as revenue growth was partially offset by investments in demand creation, infrastructure and DTC. We are pleased by the underlying strength of our business and expect that momentum to continue over the balance of the fiscal year. That said, FX headwinds have had a significant impact on our EPS growth for the first half and we expect to face ongoing pressure from weaker developing market currencies over the balance of the fiscal year. Our updated full year guidance reflects both the year-to-date and forecasted balance of year impact of this FX pressure. Specifically, we expect revenue for Q3 to grow at a high-single digit to low-double digit rate and Q4 to grow at a low double-digit rate, reflecting the weighting of futures orders to the back half of the futures window. For the full year, we expect revenue to grow at a high-single to low-double digit rate. Gross margin for the first half of the fiscal year exceeded our expectations as we saw a mix shift to higher margin products, higher average selling prices and continued strength in our DTC business. While we expect these factors will continue to drive margin expansion in the second half of the fiscal year, we will be facing new pressures as raw material costs shift from tailwinds to headwinds and we increase discounts to clear pockets of excess inventory. We also expect to face continued pressure from labor costs and foreign exchange. As a result, we expect gross margin to expand by about 25 basis points in each of Q3 and Q4. For full year FY'14, we now expect gross margin expansion of approximately 75 basis points. For Q3, we expect total SG&A to grow at a high-teen's rate, driven by demand creation growth of over 20%, reflecting phasing of spending in support of key sporting events, as well as comparisons to a relatively lower level of spending in the third quarter of FY'13. We expect operating overhead to grow at a high-teen's rate in Q3, reflecting ongoing investments in strategic initiatives. For the full year, we now expect SG&A will grow at a low-teen's rate. For FY'14, we continue to expect the effective tax rate will be about 25%. As Mark said at the top of the call, we feel great about the strong results we delivered in the first half of the year. As we look ahead to the second half of FY'14, we will continue to make strategic investments to drive long-term growth, even as we capitalize on those investments we have already made to deliver appropriate returns for our shareholders in the near-term. We are now ready to take your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question come from Omar Saad with ISI Group. Your line is now open. Omar Saad - ISI Group : Thanks, guys. I appreciate all the information, very helpful. I was wondering if you could elaborate, you talked a lot about the gross margin dynamic, I was wondering if you could elaborate on the - it sounds like there's a mix shift to more premium products higher price points, and how do you think about the gross margin dynamics long-term, especially as you layer in some of these manufacturing revolution initiatives. Thanks. Mark Parker : Well, first I would start with the quarter. As I indicated in the prepared remarks, we did see a lot of things go right in Q2. We are continuing to see higher average selling prices and that's driven by both, price increases we have taken as well as very strong growth in the premium end of both the footwear and the apparel product lines; and the revenue mix, as I said, has definitely shifted to higher margin pieces of business. For example, the growth in Western Europe as well as growth in performance basketball and DTC are all positive mix shifts for us. We also had some lower discounts in Q2, as we were clearing a lot of inventory in China in this quarter last year, so all very positive things and we also had a bit of a tailwind from raw material costs, so all of those were upsides in the quarter and that offset some of the FX headwinds and the higher labor costs. As we talked about on the prepared remarks, I do think that most of those pluses are going to be positive factors over the balance of the year and certainly the strategies around looking at our pricing each season and making sure that we are taking the benefits from the differentiation of our products and the improved retail presentation that's clearly part of the strategy and certainly long-term. We are very focused on the premium aspects of our brand and our product lines, and as we bring new innovations to the market, we are definitely trying to use those to help move margins higher. So, as we think about a lot of the long-term things that we do control, we are really focused on long-term expansion in gross margin. Obviously, there's a lot of factors out there that we don't control and so on the long-term we obviously aim to offset things like currencies and increase labor costs, and we are confident that the strength of our brand and our products lets us do that over the long-term. Don Blair : Let's take a quarter-to-quarter look obviously at pricing opportunities that will continue to be an important lever here. We are looking at, as you asked about the manufacturing innovations, very committed to that. We are actually accelerating our innovation agenda there and confident that we can take some bigger steps, particularly as we scale some of these innovations to help offset some of those input cost headwinds, so it's a balancing act as always. Frankly, I think we are in a great position, innovation pipeline is incredibly strong, new products coming in at some premium price points that I think are incredibly compelling, so all that bodes well, I think, to help us on that margin line. Omar Saad - ISI Group : Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Don Blair : Thanks, Omar. Operator : Your next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Robby Ohmes - Bank of America : Thanks, guys. A great quarter. Just two questions. Just first to follow-up on -- a little bit of follow-up on Omar's question. Your futures orders, I think you said 10% unit growth to get to the 13%. Can you tell us what that would look like, the split for North America, ASP versus unit growth? Then maybe with the unit growth so high, I don't think the industry is growing that high globally in units, and can you talk about and I don't think I am seeing same-store sales growth like that for some of your largest customers, can you maybe help us understand where this new distribution is coming from the fastest? Then the second question was just on China. I am hearing a 20% comp in your own DTC and some of the comments on the partner stores that you have done some work on, and then the total revenues, you are being cautious on, maybe just a little more help in understanding when you could return to a more stable, secular, double-digit growth in China? Thanks. Don Blair : Okay. So let's just start with the first question about futures. You are correct that that 13% futures growth is 10% on units and 3% on average selling price. We are seeing that trend pretty consistently around the world where we have got expansion in average selling price, which as we said earlier and Mark reiterated was driven by pricing opportunities as well as shifting of mix to premium products, so we are seeing that pattern around the world. I would rather not get into trying to reconcile individual geography numbers at this point, but it is a pretty consistent pattern. As far as the relative growth rates, I mean, in our futures numbers are, first of all, embedded the DTC demand as well. So that DTC growth that we are seeing, both online as well as comp store numbers is driving some of that growth. Then similarly, if you look at our wholesale customers, a lot of them have online businesses as well which are driving accelerated growth, so we feel really good about the momentum we have got in the marketplace. We are certainly outpacing the growth of our key accounts because we are taking share in those accounts. So as we look at the growth trends, we feel really good about how the category offense is driving that sustainable growth around the world. So with respect to China, let me hand it off to Trevor. Trevor Edwards : Yes, on China, as we said in the prepared remarks, we feel really like we are making great progress around our reset strategy. We are obviously very encouraged by the results of our Q2, and we are seeing continued improvement in our key performance metrics. We kind of pointed out a couple of things. Obviously we talked about DTC -- the comp store is actually 20%, and we are seeing revenue and sell-through in our re-profiled doors outpacing the fleet averages. Then also, we are seeing an improvement in the inventory level that are in the marketplace. So all those things are really pointing in the right direction. However, one thing that we have said, I think pretty consistently, is that we won't expect it to be a linear path to growth, so when we talk about futures being 1%, we feel good about that because, again, we are continuing to get all the elements of the business back together. Now in terms of a specific time, we can't really say a specific time. What we can say is that we feel great about the long-term potential of the marketplace. We feel that we have a really strong brand, and we are continuing to position the brand in the right way and we are segmenting the market in the right way and the merchandising strategies we are doing are all working, so it's more a matter of time but I can't put out an exact moment and say its then but, again, we feel very confident about the future. Robby Ohmes - Bank of America : So it's fair to say that it's still a situation that I think you commented on the past that your partners, are maybe ordering more from you than you are currently willing to ship to them in China? Trevor Edwards : I am not sure I want to address relative conversations we might have with our consumers, Robby, but I think the key aspect of what we are doing in China here is we are really focused on sustainable productive retail spaces and nothing succeeds like success. When these new concepts and these new merchandising assortments are selling the way they are then our partners are very, very eager to get on that path. Mark Parker : We are taking a very disciplined approach here and maintaining that as we scale. Robby Ohmes - Bank of America : Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi. Your line is now open. Kate McShane - Citi: Thanks. Good afternoon. My first question is around the higher ASPs, and specifically in apparel, can you talk a little bit about if you are raising prices on existing apparel platforms or is it more on the new technology you spoke about earlier in the call today? Mark Parker : Yes. It's actually a combination of both. What we are continuing to do in our apparel business, and certainly we have done it recently with the new Tech Pack launch that we did for sportswear. It is a great example of bringing innovation to what can some likely seem as a dormant category, so we were able to bring great innovation there. Obviously, as we talk about here getting paid for that work is a really important piece, so we are actually driving, obviously higher prices as well as making sure that it's delivering. The Aeroloft is another example as well as Dri-Fit Knit, so you are seeing across the board we are bringing innovation into the marketplace and using that as an opportunity to make sure that consumer is getting the right value, because we bring great innovation into it and our focus certainly has been around our sportswear business making sure that we have the premium segment which we call the Red Label, which is actually growing at a really rapid rate right now, really around the world, we are seeing that consistently. All those things are pointing to our ability to take premium price based on the strength of our brand as well as the strength of the technology that we put in place, and clearly the consumer is seeing great value from that. Kate McShane - Citi: Okay. Great. Thank you. My second question with regards to Flyknit and the supply chain, I know it's a multiyear strategy to build this out, but can you walk us through how you are progressing with your investment in getting the Flyknit supply chain more robust and what is still needs to be done? Mark Parker : Yes. Actually, we have been very aggressive in our investment in scaling Flyknit production capacity, namely, with the couple of major partners here. I actually feels quite good about the pace that we are moving. We are actually moving it to more technical executions of Flyknit 2, which take actually more time from a production and a design engineering standpoint, very aggressive in terms of how we are innovating using this technology, so that creates more challenges, if you will, all the way through the manufacturing process, but really feel good about where we are. As I said earlier, we have it scaled across many of the running, actually all of the running platforms. We have it in sportswear, in training, just introduced in basketball and I think you will see Flyknit continue to be a really important technology force as we scale and leverage across even more categories going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Svezia with Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open. Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial : Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my call. Firstly, I just want to touch on Western Europe. You have shown very nice improvement there and I guess more specifically on the footwear side than on apparel, so I was just curious maybe just talk about your progress in Europe on the apparel segment of the business. How we should think about that? Also, unless I might have missed it, I don't know if you mentioned global running. If it was up, by how much? Then the last question I just had for, Don, for you. Just maybe if you could rank between when you think about gross margin in the second half of the year, 25 basis points in the back half, maybe rank between FX, some of the inventory you need to cleanup, input costs, in terms of where the bigger heavyweights or where the biggest deltas are occurring? Thanks. Don Blair : Okay. On Western Europe, again, we saw great results for Western Europe as we talked about, 15% revenue growth. We are actually seeing that both, across footwear and apparel, so both of those are actually growing with strong double-digits. The futures growth, it was also 23%, which has shown continued momentum across multiple categories. One of the keys around Europe and it really goes back to what Mark spoke about earlier, which is we went in and did a strategic reset in Europe, where we really focused on key accounts as well as centralizing our approach to those key accounts, as well as accelerating the category offense. So what we are seeing is, we are seeing really great growth around performance. We are seeing growth in both footwear and apparel. We are seeing growth in our sportswear and our performance businesses, with actually performance leading the way. So we are seeing great growth in Running, Basketball, Football, and Women's Training. We have talked before about the success we have been having actually in Football. So across the board, we would say that we are gaining strength in the marketplace and delivering even greater separation in our footwear position in Europe. We truly believe it's part of the total offense that we have got in place in Western Europe. So we are very confident about where we are there and we would say the category offense is actually paying great dividends. Now around Running we are actually seeing, again, we didn't talk about Running this time and we see again, we feel great about the results where we are seeing a continued strong growth in both revenues and futures and it's really a case of the total offense that they are playing in which is both footwear and apparel across multiple geographies. Obviously it's been a key driver for North America for the period but we are actually seeing growth really across all the geographies going forward and we feel very confident about the innovation pipeline that we have coming in Running. So all those things said, again, we continue to feel really good about our position in Running and we see further opportunity to continue to grow in the marketplace, as we work specifically with our customers on giving new expressions to the Running business. Mark Parker : And quickly, your question on gross margin. The largest swing between where we were in the second quarter and what we are now seeing for the third and the fourth quarters is that move from tailwind to headwind on materials and that is something that obviously relates to the spike we saw several years back in materials, which has been ebbed. We have now gotten back essentially to stabilization and we see that the second half of the year as that's starting to move into a headwind situation. Next would be the swing in discounts from favorable year-on-year to a little bit higher as we clear some pockets of inventory and then FX would be the third. Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial : Okay. All right. Thank you very much and all the best on the Holidays. Kelley Hall : Thank you. Mark Parker : Thank you. Kelley Hall : Next question, operator. Operator : Your next question comes from Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley : Hi, good afternoon. Kelley Hall : Hi, Jay. Mark Parker : Hi, Jay. Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley : Trevor, you said Nike is in the business of making big moments bigger. That's a fascinating statement. Can you talk about that statement as it relates to the Winter Olympics? What sports and athletes, products and marketing strategies will help make that big moment even bigger? Trevor Edwards : Obviously, thanks for that question and I personally like the words about we make big moments even bigger. What we mean by that is it is our job as a brand and we have always seen at this way to continue to bring excitement to the marketplace to give consumers new opportunity to connect with our brand to bring innovative products into the marketplace and also to elevate how they connect at retail. So, we are very excited about the Winter Olympics as we are preparing for the games. We are still the sports brand of choice in Russia and in Eastern Europe and it's a great opportunity for us to continue to bring inspiration and innovation to the athletes as well as to broader consumers. So at this moment a lot of our focus is on just making sure we have the right products in the pipeline and we are pretty much lined up for that and we feel really good about lineup for Sochi. Interestingly as we mentioned too, we also have the World Cup coming up, which is a very big opportunity for us to bring even more greater innovation into the marketplace. Don Blair : So just to hit a couple of high points here. We do sponsor the Ice Hockey Federations, and so you will see certainly Nike on the ice. We have certainly got some connections into the Action Sports piece. And as Trevor said, we have got some great connection points with our business in Russia, which has been a fantastic success story for us this year. Our business there is really growing very rapidly and the Olympics are a great ignition point for that marketplace. Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley : Right, and thanks. Don, if I ask you one more question. Just on the guidance, you were very clear that FX, input cost, labor cost or headwinds, but it looks like the full-year guidance is up a little bit from where we were last quarter. Can you talk about how much the guidance has just flowed through from what we saw this quarter and how much is based on an outlook that maybe a little bit higher for the second half of the year than you had before? Don Blair : The guidance that we gave is actually line-by-line, you have to look at all the lines. Revenue, we have seen fantastic momentum and so there is maybe a touch more optimism on the revenue line for the full year. We have also seen more optimism on the spending or on the gross margin side. Spending has re-phased over the course of the year, so when you look at the year holistically, we have got a lot of puts and takes on the lines but the underlying change really is that currency headwind. The impact in the first half was about 10 points of EPS growth. You didn't see all of that because of the way our SG&A phasing played out, but that is definitely what's really driving changes in the full year outlook is really the carryover of that from the first half. Kelley Hall : Operator, we will take one more question. Operator : Your final question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is now open. Jim Duffy - Stifel: Thanks. Happy holidays, everyone. Don, I am looking for if you will a little more clarification on the change in the SG&A guidance. Given that currency is a bigger headwind on the top line, one would think there would be give back there at the SG&A line. Am I thinking about that incorrectly? Don Blair : It all depends on where it is around the world, so the major changes in currency are developing market currencies, which would be markets like Russia, Brazil, Mexico, some of the businesses where we have fairly businesses and those currencies have been hit pretty hard. That's not where a lot of our investment dollars go. Quite a bit of the investments we are making around DTC are in developed markets and a lot of investments that we make in innovation are actually right here in the U.S. Jim Duffy - Stifel: Got you. Okay. Then growth in the Converse brand continues to impress. Can you speak to some of the efforts to diversify the business and the contribution to growth from franchises other than Chuck Taylor's? Mark Parker : Actually, I will jump in. This is Mark. We have introduced this last quarter and it is just beginning of a huge commitment to diversify the footwear business beyond the Chuck Taylor All Star and that's the cons footwear part of the line, feel good about the initial start there. That will ramp up as a bigger priority and a bigger scale play over the next fiscal year or two. Apparel, we are just in the infancy stages there, really focused on the specific segments of the market, specifically tees and fleece to start and feel really good about where we are in the upside opportunity there as well. Then we see some investments in DTC, e-commerce also yielding some growth for us as well. Jim Duffy - Stifel: Great. Thank you very much. Mark Parker : Thank you. Kelley Hall : Great. Thank you, everyone. Appreciate you joining the call and have happy holidays. We will talk to you next year. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Nike, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker. Mark Parker - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Kelley and hello everybody. Q3 was a strong quarter for Nike. Even in the face of challenging macroeconomic conditions, we delivered robust growth and we did so in a well-balanced way across our entire portfolio. By the numbers here are the highlights. Nike, Inc. revenues grew 13% to $7 billion. Gross margins increased 30 basis points to 44.5%. SG&A rose 16% reflecting strategic investments in our brands and our operations. And despite currency pressure, diluted EPS rose 4% to $0.76. We delivered these results because of the breadth and depth of the Nike, Inc. portfolio. For a company that does business in more than 190 countries, volatility is a fact of life. Although Nike, Inc.\u2019s global reach increases the complexity of our business, it also presents us with the opportunities to leverage strength in certain areas while we continue to invest in others. Because our portfolio includes a diverse set of categories, geographies, products, brands and distribution channels, we are best positioned to manage through an ever-changing macro environment. Our deep connection with the consumers ensures we focused our innovation on products and services that consumers expect and also on those that they never thought possible and our commitment to operational excellence and our supply chain and our financial management and then our resource allocation ensures we remain laser-focused on driving profitable sustainable growth. While we are not immune to the macroeconomic environment, we certainly have a management team that knows the terrain and can effectively drive growth in various conditions. And that is why I am so confident in Nike\u2019s ability to create shareholder value. While the Nike portfolio is diverse, there is a common theme. It\u2019s powered by innovation. We don\u2019t innovate just for the sake of change. We do it with a clear purpose and that\u2019s to help athletes reach their full potential. The breakthrough performance products we develop with insights from the world\u2019s best athletes become the must-have performance in sportswear products for consumers. And global sports\u2019 moments continue to present the perfect opportunity for us to showcase our innovation. When the world\u2019s greatest athletes compete on a global stage, we are inspired to create some of our most exciting and game changing products and we can connect our brands to consumers when the world is watching. I want to highlight three examples from Q3. First, for the Super Bowl New York, we launched an array of innovative footwear and apparel for the NFL\u2019s biggest moment. In footwear, we debut the Vapor Carbon Elite Cleat designed for speed and quick cuts. As part of our long-term commitment to take advantage of the most advanced manufacturing processes, we have leveraged Nike\u2019s state-of-the-art 3D printing capabilities to inspire this revolutionary new cleat, which we put on the field in record time for football\u2019s ultimate game. As we do with all of our innovations, we plan to expand the transformative benefits of 3D printing across multiple areas of our business. In apparel, we launched the Silver Speed collection of on-field, sideline, training and sportswear products, including the Aeroloft Summit Jacket, which is constructed to be lightweight and breathable. Warned by players on the sidelines, the Jacket made a great statement of brand innovation in a game that was seen by over 110 million viewers. And for the fans, we updated the Nike NFL Limited jersey combining on-field innovation with premium style to give consumers an authentic way to express their love of the game. Next, the Winter Olympics, which featured incredible displays of athleticism and accomplishment. Nike was on the ice as both Canadian men\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey teams took gold wearing our lightweight game jersey. The jersey leveraged innovations from across our categories, including Nike Flywire, a technology originally developed for basketball footwear. The Olympic hockey jersey provides another example of how we take innovations develop for one category and show them not only across categories, but also across product types. The U.S. team medal stand apparel featured our Aeroloft 800 Summit Jacket. So, it was a privilege to be there when U.S. athletes like snowboarder, Sage Kotsenburg who won gold in slopestyle, celebrated their greatest achievements in front of a global audience. In the Olympic village and at the many sport venues, the Nike athletes also wore our Tech Fleece with its technical performance elements to provide lightweight warmth. Both Tech Fleece and the Aeroloft Summit Jacket have quickly become go-to-apparel items for consumers. And then of course in the run up to World Cup, you have seen us launch an impressive collection of cutting-edge football products, the Hypervenom boot with the NIKESKIN mesh upper that provides an amazing level of ball feel. The Hi-Vis boot designed to help footballers see teammates quickly and make critical plays. 10 new national team kids featuring Nike Dri-FIT technology for better cooling and our lightest Nike Pro base layer ever. And the Tiempo Legend V with Nike Hypershield technology to give this leather boot incredible all -weather performance. And just two weeks ago, Trevor and I were in Barcelona to introduce the new standard in performance football boots, the Magista. With the radical new silhouette, the boot is designed to enhance player fit, touch, and traction for a game that has become faster and more intense. The Magista was a result of four years of work in our sports research lab incorporating insights from the world\u2019s best football athletes, including Barcelona\u2019s Andres Iniesta and Paris\u2019 Saint-Germain\u2019s Thiago Silva. This is the first football boot to utilize Nike Flyknit technology, something many thought impossible. We didn\u2019t set out to invent a Flyknit football boots, but we listen to our athletes and harnessed Flyknit\u2019s power to re-imagine what a football boots could be. We have used Flyknit to revolutionize running and basketball and now we\u2019ve done the same with football which is exactly what you\u2019d expect from Nike. When it comes to innovation we pride ourselves on being the pacesetter, we get out in front and we stay on the offense. The World Cup is now just a few months away and you can expect even more excitement leading up to the opening match in Sao Paulo. Products we\u2019ve launched so far take the game of football to a new level and before the first whistle in Brazil we will have more amazing products to come. Football is the biggest sport in the world and Nike is the leader in innovation for athletes. That\u2019s a combination that drives us to deliver bolder innovation for the World Cup than we\u2019ve ever done before, so stay-tuned. So these are just a few of the innovations that represent who we are as a company. And they demonstrate our commitment to athletes and how we drive growth across our portfolio of businesses. And because we are Nike we just don\u2019t innovate for the present, we innovate for the future. The steps we\u2019re taking with digital, Flyknit and 3D printing technologies and with new materials and methods of manufacturing are driving us to improve performance and achieve new levels of sustainability. When I consider these steps it\u2019s clear to me that Nike has more capacity to innovate in more dramatic ways than ever before. The opportunities are truly unlimited but our resources are not. As a result we\u2019re relentless editors because innovation isn\u2019t about just doing more, it\u2019s about doing things better, it\u2019s about staying sharply focused on the opportunities that have the highest potential for growth and that\u2019s how we unlock our true potential. There is never an off-season for Nike. We will continue to leverage the power of our portfolio and the power of innovation to connect with our consumers and create long-term shareholder value. So thanks everyone. And now here is Trevor to discuss the Nike Brand. Trevor Edwards - President, Nike Brands : Thank you, Mark. The Nike Brand delivered another strong quarter as our innovative products compelling consumer connections and effective marketplace management continue to drive growth. On a constant currency basis Nike Brand global revenue increased 14% with growth across all geographies and key categories including double-digit growth in our largest categories of sportswear, running and basketball. Nike Brand DTC grew 23% driven by 10% comp store growth and an impressive 57% growth in online sales as our digital investments and sharper merchandising increased traffic, conversion and average order on Nike.com. And finally global futures grew a robust 14%. These strong results are driven as always by our relentless focus on the consumer. Consumers worldwide expect and demand cutting-edge products, engaging consumer experiences and powerful retail presentations. Nike\u2019s ability to deliver on all three strengthens our position as the brand of choice with consumers and builds our business around the world. To see these dynamics in action let\u2019s first take a look at running. Running is our heritage and our largest performance category. But as we like to say at Nike there is no finish line and that is certainly true of the running business which continue to deliver strong results with revenue growing at a double-digit rate in Q3. That growth is fueled by our steadfast focused on bringing innovation to the market. In running footwear we expanded our breakthrough Flyknit platform. The new Flyknit Air Max combines Flyknit with an improved Max Air to create lightweight well conditioned, a well cushioned running shoe. Also resonating with consumers it\u2019s the resilient ultra-light Flyknit Lunar2 with its supportive Lunarlon cushioning. And in running apparel which is fueling growth in the category, we continue to gain share with our new Dri-FIT Knit products. The running shirts with their softer, high stretch knit are best sellers in the market. We also drive growth by targeting our resources against the biggest opportunities. A great example of this is women\u2019s running, an important pillar of our women\u2019s amplified strategy. That strategy is working and our women\u2019s business grew faster than our men\u2019s business again in quarter three. A key element of this strategy is the Nike Training Club. This concept within Nike stores offers cross merchandise collections from women\u2019s running, training and sportswear, and a high level of service dedicated to helping our consumer achieve our goals. We continue to see strong consumer response to this retail concept and expect to have nearly 50 locations globally by the end of fiscal year \u201814. These retail successes combined with strong wholesale partnerships like the Nike Track Club at Finish Line are growing the running market not just our share. The other performance category I would like to discuss is basketball. Both the Nike and Jordan\u2019s brands continue to deliver the very best in basketball with innovative products and groundbreaking experiences. Q3 was the tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for our basketball category. And as the game becomes increasingly global, this growth story is just getting started. Our continued success in basketball is the result of creating the game\u2019s most cutting-edge products. Our lightweight and breathable Hyper Elite uniforms provide Nike college teams a new level of performance just in time for March Madness. In footwear, the power of our innovation engine is on full display with the LeBron 11, the KD 6 and the Kobe 9 Elite, which since its launch has sold out at nearly every location as soon as it arrives. And our new Hyper Elite Fanatical sock have become a popular performance item, which speaks to the opportunity Nike has in expanding the market by creating new segments. These products come to life in retail experiences that expresses deep love of the game serving those who share that passion. All over the globe, Nike is driving and growing the basketball market from our own DTC stores to Foot Lockers\u2019 House of Hoops. Likewise, the Jordan brand leads by combining innovation with unique sense of style that speaks to the legacy of Michael Jordan. Quarter three included important Jordan milestones, the largest one day product launch in the brand\u2019s history with the release of the latest Air Jordan 11 and the debut of the exciting new retail concept in partnership with Footaction, we opened the first ever Jordan-only store in New York City called Flight 23. Jordan athletes, Earl Thomas and Carmelo Anthony visited the store at the opening and gave it rave reviews. Consumers agree with the initial results exceeding expectations. The final category I want to touch on is sportswear. We often talk about our three-pronged Amplify strategy of compete, train and express. Sportswear represents the expressed portion of that equation. It is a key element of the product assortment for our performance categories and offers consumers\u2019 premium, sports-inspired products to express their love of the game. With new silhouettes, fabrics and styling, we have elevated the quality and technical innovation in traditional sportswear styles resulted in the category delivering double-digit growth in Q3. Let me now turn to a few of our geographies. First, the emerging markets, this diverse portfolio offers significant growth opportunity today and well into the future. For the quarter, revenue was up 19% and futures were up 24%. So let\u2019s start with a quick update on Mexico. We continue to work with our third-party logistic provider to resolve the distribution challenges I discussed last quarter. While we still have work to do, we shipped demand in Q3. Over the next couple quarters, we will continue to refine our processes and work to clear any excess inventory. Meanwhile, consumer demand for our product in Mexico remains strong and we are working closely with our wholesale partners to properly manage the flow of product into the marketplace. Now, across the rest of the emerging markets, we saw 7 of our 9 territories reporting double-digit revenue growth. As Mark described, this summer the entire world will see the full power of the brand with game-changing products, compelling retail presentations and inspiring campaigns as we lead up to the World Cup in Brazil. By amplifying the power of sports, we grow our business in the emerging markets and all around the world. In North America, our category offense continues to drive growth across every category with Q3 revenues up 12%. The Nike Brand continues to be incredibly strong in North America as demonstrated by our 9% futures growth. And last month the Super Bowl provided an incredible energy point for the brand. As Mark mentioned we drove excitement in the marketplace with innovative products and elevated retail experiences, which included both DTC locations and our wholesale partners such as Field House at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and also the Yardline at Champs. As I\u2019ve said before Nike is in the business of making big moments bigger which is exactly what we did and we couldn\u2019t be happier with the results. In Greater China revenue grew 7%. Our strategy to reset the marketplace for profitable long-term growth is working and we\u2019re creating more productive retail with focused product assortments that strengthened our position as the number one performance sport brand. Our results for Q3 reflect progress against that strategy. We work with our wholesale partners to better balance supply and demand and we\u2019ve made changes to the supply chain that are improving inventory levels in the marketplace. In DTC where we tested and deployed new merchandising concepts results remain strong, revenue up 27% with comp growth of 11% and expanding margins. And our wholesale partners are seeing positive results in their re-profiled doors which continue to outpace the rest of the fleet. We still have work to do in China, in our China Reset but we feel great about our progress. These efforts are improving our business today and importantly they set a strong foundation for our long-term profitable growth in China and we continue to see tremendous growth opportunity in this key geography. Lastly let me turn to the Western Europe where revenue accelerated to 19% and futures were up 30% with reported EBIT up 54%. Growth was broad-based from both a category and a territory perspective, revenues in the UK and AGS which is comprised of Austria, Germany, and Switzerland were up double-digits for the second quarter in a row. From a category perspective we saw double-digit growth across our largest performance categories, running, football, basketball and women\u2019s training. Notably sportswear also grew double-digits which amplifies our performance positioning. Our DTC operations which continue to strengthen Nike\u2019s brand positioning and drive growth were up 29% driven by 14% comp store growth and a strong growth online. And lastly EBIT results were also driven by expanding gross margins reflecting a clean marketplace and a strong sell-through of new styles. This success in Western Europe is no surprise. By restructuring our business two years ago we now work closer with our wholesale partners to better segment and differentiate the market. Our work to transform the marketplace with our own DTC locations and key retail partners such as JD Sports and Foot Locker has improved the experience for our consumers. All told we\u2019ve strengthened our brand and expanded the potential of our business and we\u2019re just getting started. Looking forward I\u2019m confident in what Nike Brand is bringing to consumers and the connections we\u2019re making with them. I like where we\u2019re and better yet I like where we\u2019re headed. Thanks, Don. Don Blair - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Trevor. As Mark and Trevor both discussed our Q3 and year-to-date growth was strong and well balanced driven by expansion across nearly every dimension of our global portfolio. These results were particularly noteworthy given this stiff currency headwinds we faced and our significant investments in future growth. It\u2019s the strength and diversity of our portfolio expanding multiple brands, categories, geographies, products and channels, which enables us to consistently deliver growth and manage risk. As always, our growth is to deliver profitable growth in the near term while continuing to make the investments that will sustain that growth into the future. Striking this balance puts us in a best position to continue to create shareholder value over the long-term despite the volatility that\u2019s an inherent aspect of a global business. With that introduction I\u2019ll now recap our Q3 results. Third quarter reported revenue for Nike, Inc. increased 13%. On a currency neutral basis both Nike, Inc. and Nike Brand revenues increased 14%. This was above our expectations as strong demand particularly in North America pulled some Q4 futures orders into Q3. Converse revenues increased 16% on a constant currency basis. Also on a currency neutral basis, Nike brand futures orders increased 14% driven by a 9% increase in units and a 5% increase in average selling price. The increase was led by extraordinary growth in the emerging markets and Western Europe as well as double-digit growth in the football, basketball and women\u2019s training categories. On a reported basis, futures grew 12%, reflecting weaker developing market currencies. Third quarter diluted EPS increased 4% to $0.76 driven by revenue growth in gross margin expansion partially offset by higher year-over-year SG&A investments and headwinds from weaker developing market currencies. We estimate changes in currency exchange rates reduced our EPS growth by 6 percentage points for the third quarter and 9 percentage points year-to-date. We expect FX headwinds will continue to reduce our EPS growth rate for Q4 and into fiscal 2015. Gross margin for the third quarter increased 30 basis points driven by higher average prices and continued strength of our DTC business partially offset by product cost inflation and FX headwinds. Third quarter SG&A spending rose 16%, reflecting 18% growth in demand creation driven by support for the launch of new products, the ramp up to the World Cup and investments to upgrade the presentation of our products in wholesale accounts. The level of spending was slightly lower than we projected last quarter as we shifted some investments for World Cup initiatives to Q4. Operating overhead grew 15% reflecting investments in infrastructure, supply chain capabilities, DTC and digital. As Trevor mentioned, we are seeing significant acceleration in nike.com growth as a result of the investments we have made earlier and we plan to continue to fund these initiatives to realize our significant global potential in digital commerce. Other expense net was $45 million for the quarter driven largely by FX conversion losses in developing markets, most notably Argentina. The third quarter effective tax rate was 22.4%, a 40 basis point improvement versus the prior year primarily due to an increase in earnings from our operations outside of the U.S., which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. This was partially offset by the comparison to a prior year benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. R&D credit. Our balance sheet continues to be in great shape and our cash conversion cycle continues to improve. As of the end of Q3, accounts receivable grew just 4% versus last year, well below the rate of revenue growth. Inventories were up 12% in line with the growth in futures. As a result, our trailing four quarter return on invested capital was 24.2%, a 120 basis point above last year and well within our mid-20s target range. Now, let\u2019s take a look at our Q3 performance by segment. In North America, revenue increased 12% on both the reported and constant currency basis driven by double-digit growth across nearly all key categories led by basketball, sportswear, men\u2019s and women\u2019s training and global football. DTC revenue grew 19% in the quarter driven by 8% comp sales growth in stores and significantly higher sales for nike.com. On a reported basis, Q3 EBIT for North America grew 11% due to strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion partially offset by higher demand creation spending to support new product launches. In Western Europe, revenue grew 19% on a currency neutral basis, reflecting strength across our portfolio of businesses. Revenue grew double-digits for every key category, except Action Sports and every territory, except Italy. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue increased 22% and EBIT increased 54% driven by revenue growth, significant gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. Revenue for Central and Eastern Europe grew 22% on a currency neutral basis, as every territory except Israel reported higher revenues. In Russia, Turkey, Poland and Greece, revenues grew at a double-digit pace. Revenue was also higher in every key category. On a reported basis, revenue grew 17% while EBIT increased 23% as revenue growth in gross margin expansion more than offset higher demand creation spending related to the Winter Olympics. In Greater China, we continue to see encouraging signs as our market reset actions take hold. In Q3, currency neutral revenue grew 7%, but by expansion in sportswear, basketball and running. On a reported basis, Greater China revenue grew 9% and EBIT increased 7% as revenue growth and gross margin expansion were partially offset by higher SG&A spending reflecting investments in our new China headquarters facility and DTC operations. One of our key objectives in resetting the China market is to increase the productivity and profitability of our retail spaces. As Trevor mentioned, comp sales for our DTC stores grew 11% in Q3 and equally important margins expanded significantly. Comp store sales for partner-operated Nike stores that we have reset with more focused assortments also continue to grow at a double-digit pace well above the fleet average. We are very encouraged by the Q3 results in China. That said, not all of our financial metrics in China will improve in a linear fashion as we optimize the flow of product into the market. As a result of planned changes in our seasonal product flow, futures are down 3% on a currency neutral basis and we anticipate Q4 revenue will be flat to slightly down. Our business in Japan continued to generate positive momentum with 10% currency neutral revenue growth driven by higher revenues in nearly every key category. On a reported basis, Japan revenue declined 9% and EBIT fell 13%, reflecting the impact of the weaker yen as well as increased SG&A behind the launch of nike.com in Japan. In our emerging markets geography, currency neutral revenues grew 19%, reflecting broad-based growth across virtually every business unit. Revenues for nearly every category increased double-digits led by running, football and sportswear. And almost every territory and new geography also reported double-digit revenue growth led by Brazil, Mexico and our SOCO territory, which includes Argentina, Uruguay and Chile. On a reported basis, revenue in the emerging markets grew 8% and EBIT increased 6%, reflecting the significant adverse impact of currency devaluations, as well as higher SG&A spending on infrastructure and DTC. For the Converse brand, Q3 revenue grew 16% on both a reported and currency neutral basis driven by continued strength in direct distribution markets, particularly the United States, China and the UK. The Chuck Taylor franchise continues to deliver sustained profitable growth and we are making progress extending the Converse brand in footwear and apparel. We are also developing the marketplace for the Converse brand by enhancing presentation in wholesale accounts, expanding DTC and transitioning new countries to direct distribution. So far this year, we have converted Scandinavia and Taiwan to direct distribution and we are preparing for additional conversions in FY \u201815 laying the foundation for continued strong growth. On a reported basis, EBIT increased 10% as higher revenue and gross margins were partially offset by increased SG&A investments in demand creation, infrastructure and DTC. The Nike, Inc. portfolio has delivered strong performance year-to-date and we expect to see continued momentum in our business as we finished the fiscal year. However, as I mentioned earlier, FX headwinds have been a significant drag on EPS growth so far this year and we expect to face ongoing pressure in Q4 and into next year. Our guidance for Q4 and FY \u201815 incorporates the expected impact of these headwinds. We now expect Q4 revenue to grow at a high single-digit rate. This is below the rate of futures growth largely due to the timing of shipments at the beginning and end of Q4 as well as lower levels of at-once and closeout sales. For the full year, we now expect revenue growth at the top end of our high single-digit target range. We now expect gross margin for Q4 to expand by 50 to 75 basis points somewhat better than our prior expectations due to a shift in mix to higher margin products and geographies as well as ongoing strength in our higher margin DTC business. For the full year, we expect gross margin expansion of about 90 basis points. For Q4, we now expect SG&A to grow at a high-teens rate. As I stated previously, we re-phased a portion of our demand creation from Q3 to Q4 strengthening our World Cup marketing initiatives. Given that shift and a relatively lower level of spend in the fourth quarter of FY \u201813, we expect Q4 demand creation growth of over 30%. We expect Q4 operating overhead to grow at a low double-digit rate reflecting ongoing investments and strategic initiatives, such as digital and DTC. For the full year, we continue to expect SG&A to grow at a low-teens rate. For FY \u201814, we now expect the effective tax rate will be around 24%. We haven\u2019t yet completed our planning for FY \u201815, but can provide some initial thoughts. We expect to see continued strong momentum in our business and anticipate currency neutral revenue growth for FY \u201815 at or slightly above our high single-digit target range. That said, this year\u2019s devaluation of developing market currencies will be a significant drag on next year\u2019s reported revenue, gross margin and profit growth. In addition, we remain committed to investing in the strategies that are driving our growth. As a result, we expect FY \u201815 EPS growth will be somewhat below our mid-teens target range. As Mark said at the top the call, we feel great about the strong results we have delivered through the first three quarters of this fiscal year. As we look ahead to Q4 and FY \u201815, we will continue to make strategic investments to drive sustainable long-term growth while capitalizing on those investments we have already made to deliver consistent profitability and cash returns to our shareholders. We are now ready to take your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Citigroup. Your line is open. Kate McShane - Citigroup: Thank you. Good afternoon. My first question is on China, one of your biggest distributors had reported that, they are regaining a reasonable profit margin by lowering the cost of purchases and there is new consideration for their performance on new metrics. And I wondered if you could help me understand how this may impact Nike\u2019s profit margins in China if at all? Don Blair : Well, first of all, we have seen as I said earlier some improving performance in our retail stores and also our wholesale partners are doing better. And I think when we get more productive and profitable in those retail spaces that raises profitability for everybody. So our objective here is to make sure that the marketplace is as compelling for the consumers as possible and that we are generating productivity and profitability at the retail space and we are confident that when we do that both we and our retailers will be making more money. Kate McShane - Citigroup: Okay, thank you. And then my second question is on basketball, if you could walk us through how you are thinking about managing the launch product as the basketball category grows globally and why you think there seems to be more of an acceptance of basketball in Europe now versus other periods of time? Trevor Edwards : Yes, it\u2019s great question. Basketball clearly is continuing to become much more of global sport. I think the fact that more people have a chance to see the sport all around the world obviously watch the NBA with the great players that we have from Kobe, LeBron, KD, I think people are having the chance to really experience how those players are just keeping the excitement in the marketplace. In terms of how we continue to manage the launch, we manage everything pretty much from a global perspective we will sometimes put in very specific products in some local markets like in China, which we will launch in specials in China. But across the board we tend to run the \u2013 our offense globally. In terms of in the future we continue to feel that the consumers are becoming increasingly excited about the sport and we look at basketball as a tremendous growth opportunity and all the work that we\u2019re doing with Foot Locker, the House of Hoops, the work that we\u2019re doing in our DTC stores are really helping to solidify the marketplace. Mark Parker : I would also add that the technology and the style that we\u2019re bringing to basketball both in Nike and Jordan are really resonating with consumers around the world. So we\u2019re just seeing an uptake in popularity in the category for all the reasons that Trevor mentioned, but also I think from a design and innovation standpoint. Kate McShane - Citigroup: Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group. Your line is open. Omar Saad - ISI Group : Thanks. Great quarter guys. Trevor Edwards : Thanks, Omar. Omar Saad - ISI Group : Hey, I\u2019d love to hear an update on two of the topics you guys talked about at the Investor Day last year, price and premiumization. Price how are you sing kind of price strategically relative to the cost inflation, I remember you talked about some new systems and processes to think about how to optimize pricing. And then on the premiumization question, could you elaborate or if you\u2019re willing to give some numbers around how the mix is shifting to more premium products? It seems the consumers increasingly willing to pay more for better products and what does that mean for your lower end offerings? Thanks guys. Trevor Edwards : Yes. On the pricing strategy I think we talked about this once before where we continue to say that our pricing strategy really centers on ensuring that we have the right price value relationship with the consumer. One of the things that our focus on innovation really does is it gives us great credence as we bring more products into the marketplace and have new innovations. You also have the strength of our brand which allows us to command a premium price and so we continue to drive the business from that perspective. The third zone that we continue to do is we continue to really look at pricing within the context of a particular marketplace and make sure that we\u2019re managing based on the market dynamics. What we\u2019re seeing is an increase in move towards premium products, a lot of our consumers are seeing our premium lines and they\u2019ve been very excited about them. So certainly what we\u2019ve seen in the sportswear Tech Pack in our sportswear lines, what we\u2019ve seen in our performance lines is the same thing. So we\u2019ve really seen limited resistance towards continue to bring premium into the marketplace but it\u2019s really based on given that consumer clear value. Mark Parker : I think there is also an opportunity to actually take that premium product in that position and that style and that innovation down in the product line as well to create that we like to call are complete offense. So we\u2019re setting the tone I think at the top. We\u2019re not seeing any resistance at all from consumers, I think the product is really resonating and I think we can continue to do a better job of actually leveraging some of that style and innovation down throughout the whole product line. Omar Saad - ISI Group : Thanks. That\u2019s really helpful. Operator : The next question comes from Bob Drbul with Nomura. Your line is open. Bob Drbul - Nomura: Hi, good afternoon guys. Kelley Hall : Hey Bob. Bob Drbul - Nomura: Just the first question that I have is for Don. On the foreign exchange losses how should we model that sort of in Q4 and in FY \u201815 knowing what you know today from your hedge position? Don Blair : Well, first of all, one thing to bear in mind is there is three things that drive the FX impact on the company, one of them is gross margin. As you know we sell product in many currencies around the world. We buy product in a variety of currencies now probably about two-thirds U.S. dollar, about a third other currencies at this point, but that\u2019s one area of FX exposure. And we did have headwinds in Q3, we actually think the headwinds in Q4 a little stronger, but at this stage we\u2019ve been doing a really good job I think of putting as Trevor said earlier premium products in the marketplace taking price on a surgical basis. So we think we can continue to expand margin but the headwinds are actually getting a little stronger in Q4. The second impact is on translation of profitability. And at this stage we\u2019re even if we stay where we\u2019re today on exchange rates we\u2019re going to have a built-in devaluation versus where we were for the fourth quarter last year. So there will be ongoing pressure for translation and that will continue until we anniversary the major devaluation. So for most of FY \u201915 we\u2019ll see that headwind as well. And then the third piece has to do with translation of balance sheet items in various countries around the world. And certainly the Argentine peso and the ruble were fairly significant drags from that this year. I think that as long as the currency stays roughly where they are that one should over time ease off but at this stage it\u2019s hard to tell. But I guess what I would step back from the whole question of currency and go back to one of Mark\u2019s comments which is when you operate in 190 countries this sort of volatility is something that goes with the territory. We have a large number of levers in our business to manage that helps us offset the pieces of the equation we can\u2019t manage. And I think our track record of delivering consistent growth even in periods of time where we\u2019ve got macroeconomic headwinds tells you that we can continue to do that. Bob Drbul - Nomura: Great, thank you. And then my second question is on the basketball category, how many teams does Nike have this year in March Madness versus last year and who do you guys project to be the winner? Trevor Edwards : I\u2019ll take the last part of that question, first. Your guess is as good as mine. No, no, I say that in a respect way, I think we have around 49 teams out of the 68 teams. So we\u2019re obviously \u2013 that continues to shift as the tournament goes on. But clearly the great thing about March Madness in those movements is that they provide an incredible platform to create excitement in the marketplace and drive demand. So to the earlier question actually those are some of the things that I think that continue to create excitement and allow us to continue to leverage our opportunity. And we\u2019re seeing those things continue to go global. So yes we\u2019ll \u2013 I hate to try and bet on exactly who wins, but as I would say the more hope the more business so we\u2019ll take it from that perspective. Don Blair : And I think Warren Buffett\u2019s billion dollars are probably safe. I don\u2019t know if anybody is going to get the brackets exactly right. Bob Drbul - Nomura: Already lost. Thanks very much guys. Kelley Hall : Thanks Bob. Operator : The next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Robby Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Great quarter guys. Kelley Hall : Thanks, Robby. Don Blair : Thank you. Robby Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I think a question maybe this is for Trevor. I was hoping you could maybe talk about Nike\u2019s youth business, you call out women\u2019s on the call, but maybe how the youth business is doing particularly in apparel relative to women\u2019s and maybe men\u2019s and maybe particularly in North America? And then my second smaller question was I apologize if I missed it, but I know that you mentioned Russia did well but is there any change to the outlook for Russia and maybe Don remind us percent of sales Russia is for Nike? Thanks. Trevor Edwards : Yes. First on \u2013 just on young athletes, our young athletes business actually is doing incredibly well. We\u2019re just seeing an increase of consumers and certainly working with our retail partners, have just clear access to young athlete\u2019s products. Part of that strategy also comes very much in line with what we\u2019re seeing around our basketball category and our performance categories, where the consumers are so they find similar products. So we\u2019re seeing an incredible growth really coming from the same sort of statement items that we\u2019ve created in the adult category. So our ability to leverage those great items makes the difference. Also in the United States we\u2019re also working specifically around with the Kids Foot Locker around the Nike Fly Zone where we\u2019re able to bring new concepts into the marketplace that gives the consumers more access. And then the third zone would be dotcom business we\u2019re seeing a continued growth of consumers coming to dotcom and looking for young athlete products. So all-in-all it\u2019s been a very strong quarter but going forward we\u2019re very bullish about the young athletes business because it just continues to grow not only in North America but really around the world. Don Blair : And with respect to Russia, Robby, I mean right now we have not yet seen any impact to our business. Obviously we\u2019re hoping that, that solution, that a resolution comes to that situation peacefully and right now we\u2019re focused on the things we can control which is making sure we connect with our consumers and make sure we provide them with innovative products. I think in terms of that business for us it\u2019s less than 25% of our CEE business. So at this stage we think that whatever happens there we\u2019ll obviously be able to manage it across our portfolio. Robby Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thanks and congrats again on the quarter. Don Blair : Thank you. Kelley Hall : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs : Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. I just had a couple of quick ones. Number one just to clarify your guidance? Number one, can you tell us whether your operating margin, your gross margin contemplates sorry your earnings guidance contemplates gross margin expansion and Don thanks for the clarification on EPS impacts from currency. How much of that is embedded into the FY \u201815 preliminary review? Don Blair : I\u2019m sorry so the first question was I\u2019m sorry can you repeat the question\u2026 Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs : Is you guidance for next year contemplate gross margin improvements and how much is \u2013 what is the EPS drag for ForEx? Don Blair : Okay. So with respect to broad outline we\u2019re really at this stage at the preliminary stages. We would expect to see over time expansion of gross margin, how much of it, obviously depends upon a lot of variables many of which are not sales yet including FX. So at this stage I\u2019m not ready to tell you a number of points that I think FX would be, what I can tell you is that when we look at the devaluation we saw in FY \u201814 and the fact that you have to anniversary that in FY \u201815 it will be a drag. The question of how much is going to depend upon where the numbers actually fall out by geography, by territory and where the currency exchange rates go. Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs : Okay. Then maybe this is a follow-up on the gross margin side. Is there anything specific on your supply chain initiatives, manufacturing revolution that you can call out as a meaningful driver to your P&L for next year? Thanks. Don Blair : Yes. I wouldn\u2019t want to get into that level of granularity just yet. What I would say is just to go back to the conversations we had at the Analyst Day and what we talked about in our last few calls we do believe that this is manufacturing revolution is going to be both impactful from a consumer standpoint in terms of the products and innovations we deliver to the market and how responsive we are as well as the cost. At this point I\u2019m not ready to talk about an impact for FY \u201815. Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs : Okay. Thank you. Don Blair : Yes. Operator : The next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is open. Jim Duffy - Stifel: Thank you. Hello everyone. Trevor Edwards : Hi, Jim. Kelley Hall : Hi, Jim. Jim Duffy - Stifel: Clearly it\u2019s been a terrific great execution across the global business and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s frustrating to not to see the full impact of that flow-through to reported earnings. Don Blair : Yes. Jim Duffy - Stifel: Couple of questions. The currency volatility in recent devaluation of some of these currencies how does that change strategy for capital allocation at all? Don Blair : Well I think it depends on your outlook for what you think the economy is going. I mean certainly as we talked about earlier we manage these individual businesses, we\u2019re looking at the consumer value equation. So we\u2019re focused on the inflation in a particular market. We obviously are looking at our deployments of demand creation and so on. But in general terms if we believe that the market over the long-haul is going to be healthy and in most of these markets we believe well and we\u2019re going to see expansion of the middle class. We\u2019re going to be continuing to build our business and connect with consumers and deliver innovative product. Certainly from a financial management standpoint we\u2019re going to try to minimize the amount of cash relieved in those markets, we\u2019re going to minimize the level of receivables and so on. So financial management absolutely is driven by where we see the currency is going. From a business standpoint sometimes these difficult times in emerging markets there are opportunities for us to gain ground. I mean the last time Argentina went through a financial issue number of years ago we actually remained committed to that market, we built our business and we took a lot of market share. Jim Duffy - Stifel: Great. Makes sense. Second question there\u2019s been a lot of discussion in the investment community around how World Cup orders benefit the futures. Clearly you\u2019ve sponsored some of the important European and Latin American teams. Is it possible to put some shape around the impact of World Cup orders to the futures and how much of the growth that we\u2019re seeing today is from sponsorships, things like the kits etcetera? Don Blair : Well there\u2019s certainly is an impact, but what I would direct you to is the conversation we had about where the growth and revenue is coming from as well as the growth in futures, we are seeing growth across categories around the world. So running is up, women\u2019s training is up, we are seeing great results as Trevor said earlier from basketball. So certainly, global football is a major driver here as it always is for this sort of event, but we are seeing growth very broadly across categories. Trevor Edwards : And I would just say that we feel obviously great about our football business and the potential as we head into the World Cup. Futures are up double-digits, revenues up double-digits, we are launching a great array of products into the marketplace. So we are super excited about the opportunity that the World Cup represents, but not only in markets like Brazil or just the emerging markets, but really all around the world. It\u2019s a tremendous platform for us to continue to grow the business. Jim Duffy - Stifel: Thank you. Kelley Hall : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : The next question comes from Dave Weiner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Dave Weiner - Deutsche Bank : Yes, good morning or good afternoon. It\u2019s Dave Weiner from Deutsche Bank. So I wanted to ask a question about China if I could and specifically kind of a two-parter. So one, it looks from what we can tell that the kind of macro environment for apparel, athletic apparel and footwear specifically is improving. So, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you are seeing in the overall marketplace. And then secondly, I think you made a comment that your own stores that have been reset saw a significant margin improvement, could you just drill down a little bit on that? Is that based on gross margin and kind of the mix of product that you are selling maybe the premiumization thesis or something else? Thanks a lot. Trevor Edwards : Yes. On China, I think the part that we clearly can say is that the reset strategy that we have put in place is working and we are obviously very encouraged by the results that we are seeing in the marketplace. As I think Don sort of pointed to we are very focused on driving both profitability and productivity at retail. What we have been able to do in our own stores is to continue to drive a premium position in the marketplace that is based on performance and then amplified through our sportswear lines. And that combination is driving a better mix in the stores that is leading to a much more profitable business. We are also across the marketplace we are narrowing the amount of categories that we focused on, which is allowing us to go deeper to make sure that we have the right size curves in the marketplace. So the team is working very specifically down to the granular details to really help us build a better foundation for long-term growth in the marketplace by making sure that we are driving against the right operational metrics, but also delivering against the consumers specifically around what the consumer wants in China. Mark Parker : Yes. It\u2019s really a case of focusing on the fundamentals, executing the merchandising, the product flow, the assortment planning and then the storytelling at retail. Some of the retail executions in those reset doors that we have in China, I would say, are some of the best we have in the world. And then the response from the consumer is obviously quite positive. The Chinese consumer as I will just say as a general point is more and more sophisticated and discriminating in terms of their choice in product and price is not a limiting factor, in the end, the product and the brand are really resonating. And we are definitely seeing that in China as we are in other parts of the world. Dave Weiner - Deutsche Bank : Great, thanks. Do you have time for me to squeeze maybe one more in, quick one? Kelley Hall : Sure, yes. Dave Weiner - Deutsche Bank : Sure, thanks. So someone asked earlier about kind of the payback schedule for some of your initiatives, 3D printing, Flyknit and kind of your other supply chain and manufacturing efficiencies and I understand you don\u2019t want to talk about next year, but could you at least comment if from the investment side if you have already kind of well on your way to kind of starting to apply the some of these initiatives broadly so that at least from an investment point of view, you have already started that to some degree? Mark Parker : Yes. I will jump into say that there is two factors that are really driving a lot of our priorities in this manufacturing revolution space. One is to create the capability to create new innovation and product that the consumers can experience. Flyknit is a great example of a process. And 3D printing as you mentioned, processes that allow us to do things that conventional shoemaking or product manufacturing process won\u2019t allow us to do. So there is breakthroughs in performance innovation that come. We are also very discriminating when it comes to making sure that we are focused on things that can really affect the bottom line, the product cost. So we are prioritizing our investments. And this is a great example of we have lots of opportunities and we need to make choices, but we are making choices against things that can help us innovate the product as well as actually reduce our product cost and our speed to market. So we actually have a very strong and deep view over the next three to five year period and that\u2019s expanding on the impact that these investments are making. And again, we are prioritizing where we think we can have the greatest impact. It\u2019s one of the areas frankly as an innovation geek I am most excited about. Dave Weiner - Deutsche Bank : Yes, great. Thanks. Don Blair : And Dave, I would say from an investment standpoint I just wanted to make the point that I think to the conversation that we just had from Mark, there is a lot more opportunity and we are not even close to the end of this. And what I would also point out is that a lot of this investment will be made in partnership with our factory group. So you won\u2019t see all of this investment on our books. In fact, in many cases, the factory partners are going to make most of this investment. We are really the drivers of the innovation, the catalyst for this, so where \u2013 we have got a long list of opportunities ahead of us. Dave Weiner - Deutsche Bank : Perfect. Thanks for the color. Mark Parker : Thank you. Kelley Hall - Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations : Well, thank you everyone for joining us this quarter and we will talk to you next time. Bye. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to Nike\u2019s Fiscal 2014 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. For those who need to reference today\u2019s press release, you will find it at http ://investors.nikeinc.com. Leading today\u2019s call is Kelley Hall, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations. Before I turn the call over to Ms. Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations and those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns, which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of Nike Inc.\u2019s continuing operations including equipment; Nike Golf, Converse and Hurley are not included in these futures numbers. Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales. References to wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the brands owned by Nike Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results. Participants may also make references to other non-public financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures. Discussion of non-public financial and statistical information and presentations of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations can be found at Nike\u2019s website, http://investors.nikeinc.com. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Kelley Hall, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations. Kelley Hall : Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nike\u2019s fiscal 2014 fourth quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today\u2019s call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations on our press release, which was issued about an hour ago and at our website, investors.nikeinc.com. Joining us on today\u2019s call will be Nike, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker, followed by Trevor Edwards, President of the Nike Brands and finally, you will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So, we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event, you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this. With that, I will now turn the call over to Nike, Inc. President and CEO, Mark Parker. Mark Parker : Thank you, Kelley and hello everybody. Fiscal \u201814 demonstrated a point I often make and that\u2019s when we innovate, we just don\u2019t innovate for the sake of change, we innovate to change the game and that\u2019s what we did throughout the year. We introduced great products, launched new consumer experiences, expanded our digital ecosystem and developed engaging retail concepts that drove excitement and energy for our brands in the marketplace. By staying true to the Nike spirit, we continued to deliver great results like those we are reporting today. Here are the fiscal \u201814 highlights. Nike Inc. revenues grew 10% to nearly $28 billion. Gross margin increased 120 basis points to 44.8%. SG&A rose 12% reflecting continued strategic investments in our brands and operations. And despite significant currency pressure, diluted EPS rose 11% to $2.97 for the full year. We are proud of those results we delivered in fiscal \u201814, but more than that, we are proud of the consistent level of growth we have been able to deliver over the years. As we continue to get bigger as a company, I am often asked how can Nike continue to grow? Well, first and foremost, there is absolutely no shortage of growth opportunities for Nike. This has never been clear to me as it is today. When I look within and across our five brands, six geographies and eight categories, I see tremendous untapped potential. And this includes areas where we can build on our current foundation such as apparel and women\u2019s and converse as well as areas where we can extend our current leadership position such as running, basketball, and football. The key to unlocking this potential is and always has been to focus on the consumer. Our relationship with the consumer is something we need to earn every day. Increasingly this relationship is one to one through the lens of their favorite sport. This is why our category offense is such a powerful advantage. The insights we draw from our deep consumer connections fuel our ability to create new products and services that excite and engage. We also know we need to remain nimble to meet the changing needs and expectations of those we serve globally. The world is becoming increasingly interconnected and consumers expect companies to be able to deliver the same level of innovation everywhere. And that means continuing to elevate and accelerate our level of innovation in products, in services, in our supply chain and in our digital ecosystem. We also know that when we focus on the consumer, we deliver value for our shareholders. We do this by ensuring our growth is profitable. The strength and diversity of the Nike Inc. portfolio allows us to manage the levers in our business to drive profitability and invest for the future so we can continue to innovate to meet the expectations of our consumers. And that is what you saw in our fiscal \u201814 performance, across all the elements of our business. And that is the virtuous cycle that fuels our success. Our unmatched ability to innovate is how we turn insights from athletes and consumers into amazing products and services that no one else can deliver. Throughout the past year, we used key events and sport moments to launch our most forward-thinking products. Together with KOBE in Los Angeles, we introduced the KOBE 9 Elite, the first basketball shoe to use our unique Flyknit technology. At the Sochi Winter Olympics we leveraged significant advances from across our categories to deliver high performance apparel, such as the lightweight hockey Game Jersey with Flywire and the Aeroloft Summit Jacket. In New York at the Super Bowl, we launched the Vapor Carbon Elite Cleat, our first cleat to take advantage of the revolutionary potential of 3D printing. At the world\u2019s premier track meet, the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Oregon Nike athletes set new U.S. records and world\u2019s best times in our performance racing footwear. And throughout fiscal \u201814 we have built tremendous momentum for the business and the brand as we delivered an unprecedented level of innovation heading into the World Cup. The combination of the world\u2019s best players and teams, our most innovative performance products and new levels of consumer engagement through social media is truly extraordinary. It sets the new benchmark for Nike and the industry. There is a lot more to share with you on our execution at World Cup, but I will save that for Trevor to discuss. The products we launched this year were the culmination of an intense period of creativity for us. But make no mistake, there is much more in the pipeline. In fact, this is the pace of innovation that you should expect from us. We know innovation is a long-term growth driver and that is why we have been so focused on extending our investments in this area. And we are seeing clear returns on these investments. I recently completed a comprehensive look at the product development taking place in each of our categories. And as you know, I am someone who lives and breathes innovation and I have never so \u2013 seen so much potential. I can tell you that the scope and scale of the innovations we will be delivering for our consumers is truly incredible. Our drive to innovate extends beyond product into areas such as digital. Our consumers expect us to be digitally connected as they are, making digital one of my top priorities for the company. Athletes are demanding more real time personalized feedback on their performance. They want easy access to products and services that will help them improve. And they want to be part of a community where they can share and compare information, find performance tips and motivate each other. We are building an integrated system of digital services that will provide seamless access to our products, a full array of services and the most advanced digital tools to measure, motivate and inspire. Delivered with the soul of sport, this will be the digital platform for lifetime consumer relationships. Our goal is to grow the Nike+ community from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of members. An ongoing two-way dialogue with consumers is also a critical element of our digital ecosystem. It provides us insights that drive innovation, strengthens consumer connections to our brands, and provides a platform for consumers to interact with each other. Through our social media platforms, we leverage the power and passion of sport to deepen our relationship with our consumers. A perfect example of this is our Risk Everything campaign, which celebrates the energy and enthusiasm of global football. Two of the campaign\u2019s videos, Winner Stays and The Last Game, have set new records for engagement with over 370 million digital views and growing. And finally, in e-commerce, we have made significant investments in infrastructure, capabilities and geographic expansion to provide a better experience. We know that when consumers shop online, they want a seamless, premium experience and that\u2019s our goal for nike.com. Our efforts are paying off. Our online business grew over 40% in fiscal \u201814, with the growth rate accelerating every quarter throughout the year. When all three elements of our digital ecosystem come together, it\u2019s a powerful strategy to drive growth and meet and exceed the expectations of our consumers around the world and its potential is enormous. It is changing how we conduct our business, tell our stories, and engage consumers. It\u2019s a big part of our future and will only get bigger and better. Fiscal \u201814 has been another strong year for us and we will take that momentum into fiscal \u201815. We have aligned our leadership and resources to fully leverage those opportunities with the greatest potential for growth. With our deep consumer connections and our obsessive drive to innovate, we will excite, inspire and no doubt, surprise. That\u2019s what you should expect from Nike in fiscal \u201815 and beyond. So, thanks and now here is Trevor to discuss the Nike Brand. Trevor Edwards : Thanks Mark. The Nike Brand had a strong finish to a great year, one that confirms the tremendous confidence that we have in our long-term growth strategy. Looking at the results, on a constant currency basis, Nike Brand revenue grew 13% for the quarter. For the year, revenue was up 11% with growth across all key categories and geographies. Nike Brand DTC revenue was up 27% for the quarter, with 22% for the year, putting DTC revenue past the $5 billion dollar mark. Results for the year were driven by comp store growth of 10%, new store expansion and online sales growth of 42%. And finally, global futures are up 12%. As always, these results can be attributed to Nike\u2019s unrivaled ability to understand the consumer, what they need and what inspires them. That knowledge drives us to identify the biggest growth opportunities and align our resources against them. Let me highlight three areas of the business, where we have seen significant revenue expansion on a wholesale equivalent basis clearly demonstrating the power of our consumer focus. First, I will start with global football, which in fiscal year \u201814 grew 21% to $2.3 billion. And that doesn\u2019t even include our football sportswear product. Now, I visited Brazil many times over the past 20 years. But having just returned from Rio, I have to say, I have never seen energy like that before. There is a tremendous passion for football across the country. At Nike, our connection with Brazil is powerful. We have been there for years and we will be there long after the World Cup ends. The enthusiasm we see in Brazil coupled with our number one footwear market share around the world is living proof that our football business has never been stronger. And the power of the category offense continues to fuel growth in football, with superior executions against engaging consumer connections, innovative products and premium retail destinations. We bring the game\u2019s passion to footballers worldwide by creating meaningful connections with them through unique events and experiences. A great example of our series is our series of Phenomenal Houses, which combine product trials, athlete appearances, football tournaments in an immersive Nike experience. Over the last 10 weeks, the Phenom Houses in Rio, London and New York and many other cities hosted more than 50,000 fans and thousands more played in our Winner Stays football tournaments around the globe. As Mark mentioned, we are incredibly proud of our successful Risk Everything campaign. For years, we have taken inspiration from the best footballers and as we always do, we share that inspiration in the stories we tell. That kind of engaging story-telling energizes current football fans and brings new fans in, growing the market today and into the future. We also delivered an incredible number of innovative football products this year which led up to the first match in Rio. With the most teams in the tournament, we launched 10 new team kits, achieving a new milestone in performance and sustainability. We introduced four ground-breaking performance boots the Hypervenom, the Tiempo 5, the Magista and the Mercurial Superfly. Both the Magista and the Mercurial use our transformative Flyknit technology to take football boots to a whole new level. The player\u2019s response of these boots has been tremendous. There are more players wearing Nike boots in the World Cup than all other brands combined and more than a third of them are playing in the distinctive and revolutionary Magista or Mercurial Flyknit boots. And finally, we are seeing great excitement at retail, as Nike football helped to drive great results in our stores, online and at football shops with our wholesale partners around the world. Our comprehensive offense on the pitch and in the marketplace drives our leadership as the world\u2019s best football brand and positions us for growth in this category for years to come. Next, I would like to talk about running, which is also driven by product innovation, consumer engagement and retail presentation. It\u2019s that focus that powers us, growing revenue 10% for the year to $4.6 billion dollars. Our results were driven by key product innovations like Free Flyknit footwear, Dri-Fit Touch and Aeroloft apparel just to name a few and we are expanding the business by connecting with a new generation of runners. In Q4 alone, we engaged with over 85,000 runners through events and millions more via our Nike+ platform. That energy directly translates at retail worldwide, in our DTC locations and running destinations like Cross Town Running at JD Sports and the Nike Track Club at the Finish Line. The consistent achievement in the running category confirms the strength of our strategy, and points to the massive potential we see for running going forward. And third, our women\u2019s business continues to drive strong growth. For the year, the women\u2019s revenue grew 12% to nearly $5 billion, moving us closer to our goal of $7 billion by fiscal year \u201817. Our women\u2019s strategy is very clear to combine running, training and sportswear into compelling product assortments that women want to run, train, and live in. With key styles like the Legend Tights, the Nike Pro Bras, and the Sky Hi Dunks, are must haves for her. Our goal to elevate women\u2019s product distribution this year was a success, as we brought the energy of the Nike Training Club app to life at retail. We blended three vital components pinnacle product assortments, premium services, and great shopping experiences that clearly demonstrate that Nike understands this consumers\u2019 needs. The 50 plus stores where we have executed these concepts have been outpacing comp store growth for the rest of the fleet. Our success in fiscal year \u201814 only hints at the enormous opportunity we see in the women\u2019s business and we are completely focused on capturing it. Now, let\u2019s shift focus on to the few of our key geographies. North America had another great quarter and posted a record year. Revenues were up 10% for the quarter and the year helping North America surpass $12 billion in annual revenue. The geography also had its most profitable year ever, with reported EBIT expanding faster than reported revenue to reach $3 billion for the year. For the last decade, we have heard that our opportunities in North America are tapped out. But as we continue to demonstrate, nothing could be further from the truth. So, how do we do it? We expand the market and at the same time we take market share by understanding the consumer better than anyone else. We extend our leadership on our perennial strengths like the basketball and running categories. This expertise also gives us insight to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities like in e-commerce and in our apparel, women\u2019s and young athletes businesses, just to name a few. And as we have often discussed, our confidence in the category offense in North America gives us the roadmap to continue to unlock opportunities in this geography and around the world. Now, let\u2019s turn to the emerging markets, which delivered exceptional Q4 results with revenue up 25%. These results were very well-balanced, with double-digit growth in almost every territory and increased revenues in nearly every key category. The Q4 results in our emerging markets demonstrated that our brand and products resonate with consumers in every corner of the globe. It was a great way to end a year that had some challenges. As we have talked about previously, we had logistics issues in Mexico in the first half of the year. This, combined with increased macroeconomic headwinds across Latin America, slowed revenue growth for the geography in fiscal year \u201814. We are continuing to closely monitor retailer inventory and the flow of product into Mexico and across Latin America to ensure the marketplace and our brand stay healthy. Now on to China, where we had one overarching goal for fiscal year \u201914: reset the marketplace for growth. We have made great progress and we are on track to achieve our goal of returning this market to sustainable, double-digit revenue growth. In our DTC doors, we tested and deployed new merchandising concepts, which drove Q4 comp store sales up 22% with continued increases in profitability. We have also tightened our merchandise assortments for our wholesale partners and re-profiled hundreds of the Nike-only stores they operate. As a result, comp store sales and profitability for their overall fleets are up with the re-profiled stores significantly outperforming. And importantly, inventory levels in the marketplace are also down significantly. While we still have work to do in China, we are making great progress. And we remain confident that we have the right plan in place to achieve our true potential in this growth geography. And finally, there is the outstanding results we are seeing in Western Europe. Q4 revenue grew 18%, a truly remarkable finish to an incredible year, as revenues in this important geography increased 14% to nearly $5 billion for the year with growth across all key categories and nearly every territory. The success we are seeing today in Western Europe stems from decisions we made more than two years ago to align our teams against the biggest growth opportunities through the category offense. We fueled growth in fiscal year \u201814 by transforming the marketplace, with shop-in-shops at JD Sports, Foot Locker, and Intersport, as well as our own retail stores and online. And we have only just gotten started. There are tremendous opportunities for continued growth ahead. By being focused and decisive, we now lead the market as the region\u2019s most coveted sports brand. Nike is the number one brand in each of the top 10 cities in Western Europe and we are the footwear market share leader in every key country. And we are not done yet. As we start a new fiscal year, we will continue to do what we do best, lead: lead with the world\u2019s most innovative products and services, inspired by the greatest athletes; lead by connecting with consumers who share our passion for sport; and lead by energizing the marketplace with superior experiences at retail and online across the world. There is no doubt about it, the momentum surrounding Nike makes me incredibly excited about what\u2019s to come. Thanks. Now, here is Don. Don Blair : Thanks, Trevor. Our FY \u201814 results continue to demonstrate our ability to leverage our diversified portfolio to drive sustainable, profitable growth. We are able to consistently deliver results like these for three key reasons. First, we invest effectively to build our business. The category offense is the framework for our growth strategy. And as Mark and Trevor described earlier, we are delivering outstanding value to consumers on each component of that framework : product, brand and marketplace. The results were clearly on display in FY \u201814. We continue to drive remarkable growth in North America and we have significantly accelerated our business in both of our European geographies. Using the learnings gathered in more developed markets, we are making great progress resetting China, while continuing to build our brands and our business in the emerging markets. Within all of those geographies, our direct to consumer operations are the sharp point, delivering strong growth in revenue and profits, while setting a benchmark for our brand and our business in store and online. And beyond the Swoosh, we are continuing to build the Converse, Jordan and Hurley brands reaching toward the enormous potential they each offer. The results we are reporting today flow directly from the investments we have made over the past several years and we are confident the investments we are making today will continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth well into the future. Second, we work hard to maintain balance across growth and profitability, investments and returns, near-term and long-term results. The breadth and depth of the Nike portfolio gives us the opportunity to invest for the future while delivering strong growth and expanding returns on capital. And that\u2019s important for us to compete effectively and to continue to deliver value for our shareholders. And the third reason we deliver consistent growth is that we effectively manage risk. In FY \u201814, we delivered 11% growth in EPS, despite losing 8 points of growth to currency headwinds. Our ability to deliver in a volatile environment demonstrates that we can pull the levers of our business to mitigate unforeseen downsides. With that context, I will recap our Q4 and fiscal 2014 results. Nike, Inc. fourth quarter revenue grew 11% on a reported basis and 13% on a currency neutral basis bringing our revenue to $27.8 billion for the year, up 10% as reported and up 11% on a currency-neutral basis. Nike Brand futures orders advanced 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by an 8% increase in units and a 4% rise in average selling price. Growth was led by continued strength in North America and Europe, even as our futures window moved beyond the World Cup. On a reported basis, futures grew 11%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly in Japan and developing markets such as Brazil, Argentina, Russia and Turkey. Fourth quarter diluted EPS increased 3% to $0.78 bringing full year EPS to $2.97, up 11% versus last year. Strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower share count more than offset SG&A investments and currency headwinds to drive EPS growth for the quarter and the year. As discussed on our previous call, our SG&A was more concentrated in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting demand creation investments behind the World Cup. We estimate that changes in currency exchange rates, including the impact on gross margin, other expense and P&L translation reduced our year-on-year EPS growth by 7 percentage points for the fourth quarter and 8 percentage points for the full year. Gross margin increased 170 basis points for the fourth quarter and 120 basis points for the year. The expansion for both periods was primarily driven by higher average prices, reflecting the power of innovative products and strong brands, as well as the continued strength of our DTC business. These upsides more than offset downward pressure from product cost inflation and FX headwinds. Gross margin for the quarter was better than expected mainly due to the strong performance of our growing DTC business, a mix shift to higher margin product and higher margins on closeout sales. As we expected, Q4 demand creation spending was significantly higher than last year, driven by marketing investments in the World Cup and key product initiatives. Full year demand creation grew 10% in line with our full year revenue growth, largely driven by an increase in sports marketing expense, as well as marketing for global sporting events and new product launches. Operating overhead grew 13% for the quarter and 14% for the full year. This reflected support for key growth initiatives, such as DTC and consumer digital, as well as infrastructure investments to support Nike\u2019s current and future growth. Other expense, net was $17 million for the quarter and $103 million for the fiscal year, driven largely by foreign exchange losses, primarily from developing markets. The fourth quarter effective tax rate was 23.5% higher than last year\u2019s 22.9% rate, which benefited from a reduction in tax reserves related to foreign operations. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 24%, a 70 basis point improvement over the prior year primarily due to an increase in earnings from lower tax jurisdictions. We continued to deliver strong returns on capital in FY \u201814, as ROIC reached 24.5%, 70 basis points above last year. For the year, we delivered $2.1 billion in free cash flow and returned $3.4 billion in cash to shareholders, in the form of share repurchases and dividends. As of May 31, inventories were up 13%, a somewhat faster rate of growth than revenue or futures. Our inventories are healthy in most markets, reflecting builds to support the World Cup and to optimize the flow of goods in Europe and China. We are continuing to work through higher inventories in Latin America, particularly Mexico as a result of the distribution center issues we experienced earlier in the year. Now, let\u2019s look at our performance by segment. North America delivered a great year, as revenues grew 10% to $12.3 billion, marking the fourth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth. For the fourth quarter, revenue also grew 10% led by double-digit growth in basketball and global football. In Q4, DTC revenue grew 21% driven by an 8% increase in comp store sales and significantly higher nike.com revenues. For the year, EBIT for North America grew 16%, as strong top line growth and gross margin expansion were partially offset by higher DTC operating costs and demand creation. As Trevor described earlier, Western Europe also had a fantastic year, as revenue reached nearly $5 billion, up 14% on a currency-neutral basis. Fourth quarter revenues grew 18%. FY \u201814 reported revenue for Western Europe grew 19%, while EBIT increased 33%, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage, as well as FX benefits from the stronger euro. In the Central and Eastern Europe, currency-neutral revenues increased 12% in Q4 and 15% for the year, with growth in every key category, except Action Sports, and every territory except Israel. Football, running and women\u2019s training were the fastest growing categories, with each reporting growth of 20% or greater for the quarter and the year. Russia, Turkey, Poland and Greece each reported double-digit growth for the year. On a reported basis, FY \u201814 revenue grew 13% and EBIT grew 19%, reflecting revenue growth and expanding gross margins. In Q4, EBIT fell 10% as stiff FX headwinds and SG&A investments more than offset higher revenues. In Greater China, currency-neutral revenue grew 2% for the quarter and 3% for the year, led by strong DTC growth. For the year, reported revenue increased 5%, while EBIT was flat, as revenue growth and gross margin expansion were offset by higher SG&A, reflecting investments in DTC and our new headquarters in Shanghai. In Q4, EBIT fell 12%, largely reflecting the timing of demand creation and operational investments. As Trevor noted, we are seeing great results from the actions we are taking to reset the China market for renewed growth. For FY \u201815, we expect revenue for the geography to grow at a high single-digit rate. As we have discussed before, we expect quarterly growth will vary, as we fine tune the seasonal flow of product into the market and given the significant variations in prior year comparisons. We expect those factors will drive somewhat faster revenue growth in the first quarter. In Japan, currency-neutral revenues were flat in Q4, but up 5% for the year, driven by growth in sportswear, football and basketball. DTC revenues increased 18% for the year, reflecting comp store sales growth, as well as the launch of nike.com. On a reported basis, results in Japan were significantly impacted by the weaker yen. For the year, revenue was down 12% and EBIT fell 6% on a reported basis. In our emerging markets geography, currency-neutral revenues grew 13% in FY \u201814, despite logistics issues in Mexico earlier in the year and generally weak macroeconomic conditions across Latin America. Every key category, except men\u2019s training, posted higher revenues for the year paced by football, running and sportswear. The geography finished the year strong, with Q4 currency-neutral revenues up 25%, reflecting double-digit growth in nearly every territory and in most key categories. On a reported basis, results in the emerging markets were also significantly affected by weaker currencies in a number of developing markets. FY \u201814 revenue grew 3%, but EBIT fell 3% as the FX headwinds eroded gross margins and generated losses on the other expense line. EBIT increased 8% in Q4, as stronger revenue growth was only partially offset by FX and World Cup demand creation investments. Converse continues to deliver strong growth with revenue up 15% on a currency-neutral basis for both the fourth quarter and the full year. The growth was largely organic driven by mid-teens revenue growth in Converse\u2019s direct distribution markets, particularly the United States, China and the UK, as well as expansion of the direct-to-consumer business. For the year, reported revenue grew 16% and EBIT grew 17%, as gross margins expanded. Fourth quarter EBIT increased 6%, as higher revenue and gross margins were partially offset by investments in infrastructure, DTC and demand creation. Nike delivered strong growth in FY \u201814 and we are beginning the new fiscal year with great momentum across our portfolio. Our FY \u201815 guidance reflects that momentum, as well as continued investments in growth drivers such as DTC, product innovation and consumer digital, along with the operating capabilities to support our growth. Overall, our expectations for FY \u201815 are largely unchanged from what we shared last quarter. Specifically, for the year, we expect reported revenue to grow at a high single-digit rate, reflecting low double-digit currency-neutral growth partially offset by continued FX pressure from developing market currencies. We expect Q1 reported revenue to grow at a low double-digit rate, driven by tremendous energy around the World Cup and continued growth in North America, Europe, China and the emerging markets. We expect gross margin for Q1 and the full year to expand by about 75 basis points. We expect average selling prices to increase driven by our ongoing focus on optimizing pricing and driving our product mix to premium. Growth in our DTC business should also benefit gross margin helping to offset increases in product input costs, particularly labor. As both Mark and Trevor discussed earlier, our growth strategies are working and we will continue to invest in them. For Q1, we expect demand creation to grow at approximately 30% as we continue to leverage the energy of the World Cup. Operating overhead for Q1 is expected to grow in the high-teens, reflecting investments in innovation, consumer digital, DTC and key operating capabilities. For the full year, we expect total SG&A to grow at a similar rate as FY \u201814. For FY \u201815, we expect the effective tax rate will be approximately 25%. As Mark said at the top of the call, by staying focused on consumer engagement and relentless innovation, we drive value for our shareholders. We are proud of the strong results we delivered in FY \u201814 and we are more confident than ever that we will deliver sustainable, profitable growth and value for our shareholders. We are now ready to take your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Kate McShane with Citigroup. Your line is open. Kate McShane - Citigroup: Thanks. Good afternoon. Kelley Hall : Hi, Kate. Kate McShane - Citigroup: Just one quick question on guidance, I think Don on the last call you had said for fiscal year \u201815 you had expected slightly below mid-teens EPS growth rate, is the guidance and the line items you gave today implying that same guidance? Don Blair : Well, Kate, as you know it\u2019s not been our practice to regularly give EPS guidance, but we do give you parameters on key line items. And I would point you back to the guidance that we gave in the prepared remarks and that\u2019s where I would like to leave it for now. Kelley Hall : And Kate, you can give a call into my team. We will walk you through it. Kate McShane - Citigroup: Okay, great. And then my second question is on share buybacks, it looks like this quarter you have bought back more on a dollar basis than you ever have in your history, how should we think about buybacks going forward? Don Blair : Well, overall, our strategy as you know is to continuously increase the level of cash returns to shareholders. And as you know, we have done that very consistently with our dividend. And we do create our share repurchase program based upon analysis of value of the company and market conditions. So, over the long-haul what we would expect is that we would continue to deliver more cash back to shareholders. The specific timing of that is based upon our assessment of the marketplace, but we are confident in our ability to continue to generate sustainable profitable growth and we think Nike is a good investment. Kate McShane - Citigroup: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group. Your line is open. Omar Saad - ISI Group : Thanks. Great job on the World Cup so far. You guys seem really visible. Congratulations. Two questions, one on China, one on supply chain. When it comes to China, it\u2019s really great to hear that you have got a store format that seems to really be working. Now that you have got this kind of this DTC format that works, are you going to re-profile the partner stores? Are you going to shutdown some of the partner stores there? Any sort of deeper dive explanation of what the retail strategy there would be helpful? And then my supply chain question on the supply chain revolution really, are you starting to see gross margin benefits from some of those activities? I mean, Flyknit is really starting to get larger in size or is that really all in the come in terms of the margin benefits of some of the new supply chain innovations? Thanks. Trevor Edwards : Okay, yes. Omar, I will take the first one. Yes, around China, yes, obviously we are seeing great results in the stores that we have re-profiled. So, we clearly feel that the reset strategy is working. What we are looking to do is continue to expand on the number of stores that we actually re-profile and so that we can continue to actually scale the results. Right now, it still represents a smaller part of our entire business, but we do believe that by re-profiling more doors, we will continue to actually build the business in the right way. So, again, we feel very confident about where we are today. We will accelerate at a faster pace as we kind of come out, but we certainly feel very confident of what we have been doing. Don Blair : And just to be clear, Omar, when we say re-profiling stores, it\u2019s not just a physical format, it\u2019s also the way we assort the stores and to Trevor\u2019s earlier point this is already in a number of stores with our partners not just in DTC and those partners are seeing great results both in terms of sales results as well as margin. So, with respect to your second question to take the financial part of the question, we are still in very early days in terms of seeing the impact of some of the more transformational approaches to manufacturing. We are starting to proliferate that into our sourcing base but we think there is huge opportunity going forward on that. Mark Parker : I will just add Omar that we are very familiar to modernizing our manufacturing and really focusing on innovation with some key partners to transform the whole process. There is lots of opportunities I think to reduce product costs and we are focused on the ones that we think have the most potential to make an impact so we are selective as to where we can innovate and how we can scale those innovations. Flyknit you mentioned has enormous potential. We are getting tremendous response to that product we are improving or extending the scope of Flyknit across multiple categories. I think you will see over the next couple of fiscal years Flyknit and some of the other investments we are making in manufacturing innovation really starts to make a more sizable impact on our product cost reduction. And that will only continue to get bigger and stronger I think in the fiscal years to come. We are very bullish on this and it\u2019s really important part of our strategy to contain product costs and then advance the innovation in our products at the same time. Omar Saad - ISI Group : Thank you. Very nice job guys. Mark Parker : Thank you. Kelley Hall : Thank you, Omar. Operator : Your next question comes from Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities. Your line is open. Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities : Hi. Good evening. Kelley Hall : Hi Bob. Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities : The first question I have is around the FX and the currency hedging losses, Don how should we model that or think about that I think it came in a little bit below the expectation this quarter at least and just sort of how to think about it for \u201815 from a modeling perspective and I guess similarly on those \u2013 that line can you just elaborate a little more how you are managing the risk in some of the emerging market volatility that you are seeing right now from a business standpoint as well as an FX standpoint? Don Blair : Sure. So I am going to leave \u2013 need to leave the conversation around modeling with our IR folks as it all depends upon the individual who is doing the modeling, but as far as the way we manage this we do have a pretty robust hedging program or the developed market currencies because normally those are the largest impacts on our business and it\u2019s relatively economical to do those sort of hedges. For a lot of the other currencies we have done quite a bit of work in the last few years developing natural offsets to some of the exposure by purchasing in multiple currencies and so as a result we have reduced our overall volatility. But there is a base line level of volatility especially in the developing worlds like Brazil, Argentina, Russia, Turkey that just is not economical to eliminate through the use of a hedging program. So unfortunately we are going to see some of that volatility flow into our numbers. With that said we have very diversified portfolio of businesses. And just as you saw in FY \u201814 we have a lot of levers to pull and we were able to deliver double digit growth in EPS even though we absorbed eight points of FX headwind for the year. Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities : Okay. And then just my second question is a lot of talk on the World Cup and the product offering, I just wondered if any of you guys would share your predictions for the winner? Mark Parker : We just hope that the best teams win. Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities : Alright. Thanks very much. Mark Parker : Good luck. Operator : Your next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Robby Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a great quarter. My question is on North America I get this question a lot, how \u2013 can you give us a little bit more of a map on how you are going to keep the North America momentum going, is it more price increases, is it an acceleration in store growth, internet is it more leaning on women\u2019s growth acceleration, just maybe a little more color on how you guys expect to keep that going through the next year or two? Trevor Edwards : Absolutely. It\u2019s a question that we clearly always get that same question. And the thing that we would continue to say is that we see great momentum in North America today. Our futures growth of 11% continued to demonstrate that we can continue to leverage the category offense to continue to grow the brand and the overall market. One of the key things that we have certainly learned is by drilling down against any of the opportunities in the category, we can continue to grow. So, we see great growth coming from the categories that currently are perennial categories as I talked about earlier, whether that\u2019s running, that\u2019s basketball. Those are obviously our key categories, which will see growth and will see sportswear growth. In addition, we see great growth come from the other categories, such as our women\u2019s business, our young athletes business as well as e-commerce. So, those are all very under-penetrated opportunities. So, we look at the North America and we see just tremendous growth potential in the marketplace. Overall, also we have our focus with our key retail partners around continuing to transform the marketplace. So, we can increase the capacity in that marketplace, which we are certainly seeing great success from doing that today. So, all-in-all, we still see tremendous ways to grow e-commerce, young athletes, women\u2019s, apparel, all of those represent really great opportunities for us to grow in addition to the current and expected businesses, where we are doing well today. Don Blair : And I will just quickly add that we have a sizable investment and ongoing investment in DTC and that\u2019s not just to create more premium points of distribution. It\u2019s actually to help us elevate our business and how we manage our brand in North America certainly and then around the world. We are getting better I think at retail presentation, consumer experiences, storytelling, merchandising, product flow, assortment planning. These are the things that you have to do just to be a better brand in a better business. And so we are leveraging that investment in DTC that really drive more potential in North America, but then also it\u2019s really a blue print for expanding our business around the world. Robby Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : It sounds great. Thanks guys. Don Blair : Thank you. Trevor Edwards : Thanks, Robby. Operator : Your next question comes from Dave Weiner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Dave Weiner - Deutsche Bank : Great. Yes, good afternoon. So, I was looking for a little more color on your long-term gross margin driver. So, I think the key drivers that you have talked about in the past are shift to \u2013 our geographic shift outside of the North America, a shift from footwear to apparel and then also a shift to DTC. It feels like the DTC is what\u2019s helping the most right now. Could you just kind of confirm if that\u2019s the case? And if it is, maybe provide a little color about when maybe the shift to apparel and the geographic gross margin shift may start to contribute to the overall gross margin gains as well if they are not already? Thanks. Don Blair : Okay. Well, let me just start with the biggest drivers. I mean, certainly, we start with the top line. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we have done quite a bit of work around our consumer value equation. And one of the things that the strength of our brand and the innovation that\u2019s in our products means that there is a great consumer value proposition at higher price points. So, certainly, working to optimize that price value equation, we think we can continue to raise prices, particularly around product innovation and brand strength. And then the second thing is migrating consumers to premium product. So, that is definitely a trend we have seen both on the footwear and the apparel side. The second one is really making sure that we are working that product cost equation. And as Mark indicated earlier, there is a whole range of supply chain and manufacturing initiatives in place all the way from the evolutionary to the revolutionary. And the objective there is to raise the productivity of labor to reduce waste of materials and produce even more premium product. And we are driving hard against those. DTC is certainly a positive driver for us. And our DTC business has increased significantly in profitability as we have driven our .com business and also as we have gotten better and better as Mark indicated at operating retail. So, all of those are key drivers. They were key drivers in \u201814. We expect them to be key drivers again in \u201815 and going forward. Dave Weiner - Deutsche Bank : Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley : Hi, good afternoon. Mark Parker : Hi. Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley : Mark, I just had a question about the reset going on in China, can you just walk us through the strategic decision-making process, we\u2019re thinking about whether to prioritize investment in distribution into nike.com versus investment in brick and mortar retail whether it\u2019s your own or wholesale partners, I am sorry, retail partners? Mark Parker : Well, we are actually investing in both. We are as I have said you have heard us talk about quite a bit we are investing in elevating the presentation of Nike at retail looking at how we can improve our ability to create a more profitable, more focused business, raise the level of execution against the categories, it\u2019s really imperative that we will not only learn how to do that ourselves in that market but actually help to leverage those learnings through our retail partners. So the physical retail investments we are making in China are absolutely critical. I am really excited about what has transpired over this past year and then our ability through \u201915 and beyond has started to scale those learnings across both our own retail and our wholesale partners. Certainly, we are very bullish on dot-com not only in China but around the world. We think that\u2019s just going to continue to be a bigger and bigger percentage of business going forward and China is certainly no exception. Very digitally connected country consumer and that channel for us, that medium for commerce is absolutely the future. So, we are going to be as bullish there as we possibly can. Don Blair : Yes. The one thing I would also underline from an economic standpoint is our focus is on productivity and profitability of retail. So for us from a return standpoint this is really driving more revenue, more profitability though a given size of distribution infrastructure which is not to say we won\u2019t expand over time but the strategy is not adding lots of new stores in lower tier cities here. We are really focused on making our existing base more profitable, more productive for us and for our retailers. Trevor Edwards : One other thing too as Mark just mentioned in China specifically last quarter we actually went in and upgraded our entire nike.com site in our China business. And that again is one of those things as we continued to transform that marketplace using all of the investments that we put in place we are now leveraging that in China specifically. So I think you will see that play out and in the future as that continues to grow. Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Mitch Kummetz with Robert Baird. Your line is open. Mitch Kummetz - Robert Baird : Yes, thank you. Trevor, in your prepared remarks, you referenced the momentum on the women\u2019s side. I was wondering, is that more of a U.S. phenomenon, are you seeing that trending elsewhere? And then in terms of the growth that you are seeing there, is it more on the apparel side and footwear, is it more DTC than wholesale? Just any color on that would be helpful. Trevor Edwards : Yes, certainly. We absolutely see just great momentum in women\u2019s business. Actually, it\u2019s not only in North America, but actually across all the geographies. We are seeing great growth as we have gone in and certainly we are seeing really a strong brand position. All the work that we have done around the Nike training app has really helped to unlock a connection with our female consumer. We continue to bring really great products and premium products into the marketplace. And so she is very obviously excited about that. And then thirdly what we are also doing is around distribution, we have been able to go in and work at our DTC doors to use them, as Don said, as a sharp point to better understand that consumer and then roll that strategy out with our wholesale partners. Now, in terms of footwear and apparel, actually we are seeing growth on both dimensions. Certainly our footwear, on both running \u2013 from running to training to actually sportswear and certainly around apparel, we are seeing great growth in the women\u2019s training apparel as well as in women\u2019s running apparel, so again just tremendous upside here. And I think going forward, you are going to see us put a lot more focus on this part of the business, because we truly believe this is an area where we can be very successful and then we see great opportunity. Mitch Kummetz - Robert Baird : Okay. Mark Parker : I will add to this. The women\u2019s business on the .com side has been incredibly healthy as well. And we expect that to continue through \u201815 and beyond and that\u2019s a real focal point for us on the women\u2019s side is that .com business. And then the futures on our women\u2019s business are actually very, very healthy as well. So, we see a lot of momentum going into fiscal year \u201815. Mitch Kummetz - Robert Baird : Okay. And then real quickly on Western Europe, I mean, a lot of momentum there, you have talked about some of the strategies that you have placed in that market. I am also wondering how much of a factor is an economic recovery there? I mean, is it mostly that you are taking share with some of these strategies or are you also benefiting from somewhat of a tailwind from economic recovery? Trevor Edwards : I think from our side we are certainly seeing just broad-based growth across all of the Western European marketplace. And that we truly believe is a function of the reset that we did two years ago when we decided to really focus against the category offense as well as have a more centralized approach to the European marketplace. So, we\u2019re seeing great growth really across all the territories and even in the Iberia, so the Southern parts, where it was struggling, we are certainly seeing strength in those zones coming back. So, we really truly believe our category offense is what\u2019s driving that. And we are seeing the numbers actually go really ahead of any economic recovery. So, we feel very strong that it\u2019s really about our approach in that market. And we think we have only just gotten started. We think there was just tremendous growth continuing to come through. Mitch Kummetz - Robert Baird : Okay, thanks. Good luck. Kelley Hall : Alright. Well, thank you everybody. I appreciate you joining us for our year end call today. And we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

In the event you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I will now turn the call over to Nike, Inc. President and CEO Mark Parker. Mark Parker : Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone. Our Q1 results demonstrate that Nike is, without a doubt, a growth company. Nike Inc. revenues grew 15% to $8 billion. Gross margin expanded 170 basis points, and diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $1.09. On previous calls, I\u2019ve highlighted three of Nike\u2019s distinct competitive advantages : our relationship with athletes and consumers, our ability to innovate, and the power of our portfolio. Those advantages are the foundation for the Q1 results we just reported, and the competitive separation we\u2019re driving in the marketplace. First, our relationships with athletes and consumers are unparalleled. By relentlessly focusing on what they want and need, we propel our business forward. We use the insights we gain to deliver the products and services and experience athletes and consumers want. The lens we use to focus these relationships is our category offense, and the power of that approach is most clearly seen during global sports moments like the World Cup. These events provide us with the opportunity to showcase our most innovative products, as the world\u2019s greatest athletes inspire us with their performance and their passion. They also create tremendous energy throughout the year, as we leverage these innovations and athlete stories to deliver compelling products and experiences to consumers through their favorite sports. As I think about the evolving consumer landscape, there are a number of trends that play to Nike\u2019s strengths. The middle class is growing around the world, interest in sport continues to grow, and consumers are investing more and more in their own health and fitness. Apparel and footwear styles are becoming increasingly athletic. Because we know the consumer better than anyone else, we\u2019re able to leverage these developments to accelerate our growth. As a result, we turn trends into real business momentum. Second, let\u2019s talk about innovation. At the heart of our ability to achieve long term growth is our unrivaled ability to innovate. Nike delivers impressive innovations because we\u2019ve developed ever-sharper insights from athletes and consumers, and we harness the power of new technologies, designs, and materials. Our capabilities today are greater than they\u2019ve ever been. Our challenge is to edit and focus those capabilities on the most significant opportunities. And when we do this effectively, we accelerate the pace of innovation, we create competitive separation, and we deliver results, like we did in Q1. In just the past 90 days, we\u2019ve demonstrated the versatility and potential of our advanced Flyknit technologies, with products in running, global football, basketball, and most recently, football in the U.S. The consumer benefits are incredible, and looking ahead, I know the potential for this is significantly increasing the scope and scale of this technology is very, very real. We set new levels of performance in apparel with products such as the Nike Dri-FIT rain jacket, the Nike Pro collection, and the further extension of our Dri-Fit Knit and collections like Nike Tech Fleece continue to drive growth and distinction by leveraging technical performance features in the premium sportswear apparel. We launched the Air Jordan 29, our lightest Jordan ever, bringing a new level of basketball performance to the Jordan brand. And just last week, we expanded the potential of our Zoom Air technology with the launch of the LeBron 12. We have some very ambitious plans for this signature Air technology. I can\u2019t tell you much more now, but I will say that the LeBron 12 is just the beginning of the revolution. It\u2019s important to understand that Nike\u2019s innovation agenda goes beyond products. It touches everything that we do. One example is how we\u2019re leveraging the power of digital. The digital world moves fast, and Nike is at the forefront. We\u2019re employing new ways to engage consumers online as we create communities, services, and ecommerce experiences that fuel our growth strategies around the world. These strategies are strengthening our relationships with consumers and driving our business, as ecommerce revenues were up over 70% in the first quarter. Going forward, we will innovate at an increasingly rapid pace. We are a growth company, because we are an innovation company. That is why we are committed to sustained investment in this area. We know it fuels top and bottom line expansion and drives value for our shareholders. And when I look at our innovation pipeline, I see innovations that will, no doubt, surprise and delight, innovations that are better for athletes, consumers, and the planet. I couldn\u2019t be more excited about what\u2019s coming. The final competitive advantage I want to highlight is the power of Nike\u2019s portfolio. It\u2019s a complete offense that encompasses brands, geographies, categories, product types, and channels. When all these components are working together, the portfolio generates amazing growth, and when we double and triple click into the various dimensions of our business, we see even more potential. The diversity within our portfolio is a tremendous competitive advantage. It allows us to thrive in a rapidly changing environment, create separation, and ultimately expand the market. Trevor will discuss the Nike brand\u2019s outstanding Q1 results in more detail, but let me give you three highlights from my point of view. One, the Nike brand is strongly resonating with consumers around the world. We\u2019re delivering robust growth and profitability in some of our largest geographies, maintaining momentum in North America, accelerating growth in Western Europe, and turning the corner with strong results in China. Two, our category offense is accelerating growth. Our largest performance businesses, running, basketball, and global football continue to expand. Sportswear grew at a strong double digit rate, and our women\u2019s and young athletes businesses grew rapidly, in fact faster than our men\u2019s business. And three, we\u2019re driving growth across an integrated marketplace. DTC revenues grew over 30% in the quarter, and our wholesale business grew double digits, reflecting strong growth in stores and online. I\u2019ve said that becoming a better retailer would make us a better wholesale partner, and our Q1 results are only the beginning. We have been extremely thoughtful about the investments we\u2019ve made against our biggest growth opportunities across the portfolio. From accelerated product innovation, to enhanced consumer experiences, to sharply focused retail executions, it\u2019s the integration of complementary strategies and investments that leads to an acceleration of growth. And we will continue to make strategic investments to drive growth for years to come. I\u2019m tremendously proud of our Q1 results, the momentum and our management team\u2019s ability to seize opportunities and manage risks. At the same time, I\u2019ve never been more excited about the potential to raise the bar even higher in the future. Thank you, and now here\u2019s Trevor. Trevor Edwards : Thanks, Mark. I\u2019m also very proud of the results of the results we reported for Q1. On a constant currency basis, Nike brand revenue grew 15%, with growth across all six geographies and nearly every key category. Nike brand DTC revenue increased 30%, driven by comp store growth of 15%, new store expansion, and accelerated growth in online sales up 70% and global futures, a robust 14% The great results we\u2019re reporting today clearly demonstrate the success of our vital growth strategy, the category offense. The power of the category offense is unleashed when Nike works with our wholesale partners to develop an integrated marketplace. This happens when we have the right product at the right time, presented in a way that clearly differentiates the Nike brand to consumers. A key component of this offense is our own DTC business, which is an important complement to the wholesale business around the globe. As I said, we delivered impressive growth in the quarter, with expansion in all three DTC concepts, in line, factory stores, and Nike.com. Our investments in DTC as a strategic driver are clearly paying off, and we continue to see even greater potential ahead. And we\u2019re investing to create compelling presentations with our wholesale partners around the world, as we expand the potential of the Nike brand in a holistic and integrated marketplace. At Nike, we earn our place with consumers every day. The World Cup is a great example of how we harness the power of sport to deepen the relationship between consumers and the Nike brand. We introduced more revolutionary product innovations in this World Cup than in any prior, and we\u2019re proud of the fact that more players wore Nike boots on the pitch than all other brands combined. Nearly a third of those players wore Flyknit boots. That\u2019s amazing. We delivered products to consumers in compelling retail experiences all over the world, from our first football-only store in Copa Cabana, Brazil, to the Nike Towns in London and New York, to football-focuses executions with our wholesale partners around the world. With great football product, compelling retail presentation, and strong consumer engagement, we drove great results. All told, global football revenue grew at a strong double digit rate in Q1, and as of the end of the quarter, we had the leading footwear market share in the nine largest football markets around the world. Next, I\u2019d like to highlight running. Our relentless drive to serve our athletes gives us an unmatched ability to meet their needs as they compete, train, and express themselves. Our Q1 results demonstrate this with double digit revenue growth, driven by premium footwear and apparel. In footwear, the Pegasus 31, the LunarGlide 6, and the Free Flyknit have all sold exceptionally well. In apparel, our Dri-FIT knit, with its seamless construction and comfortable fit, has continued to resonate with consumers. And in sportswear, we continue to showcase our deep heritage with products like the Air Max Lunar1, the Nike Tech Windrunner jacket, which delivered strong results. Like the athletes we serve, we look for ways to continually improve. We see tremendous growth opportunities for running around the globe, and we look forward to another season of great events, starting this fall, with the Nike women\u2019s half marathon in San Francisco, followed by marathons from Chicago, to Amsterdam, to Shanghai. Now, I\u2019d like to talk about our women\u2019s business, which continued to grow faster than men\u2019s. Q1 revenue for women\u2019s grew at a strong double digit pace as we focused on realizing the significant potential in this large and growing business. It all starts by engaging and inspiring consumers, and here are some key examples. The Nike Plus Training Club has been downloaded nearly 17 million times, and has become a personal trainer for women around the world. And we\u2019re also inspiring women with live experiences every day. 70,000 members participate in Nike run clubs across the globe, and more are joining daily. We also lead the women\u2019s market by continuing to deliver innovative products such as the performance footwear for the gym, like the Nike Free Trainer 4.0, premium apparel such as the Nike Sculpt Tights and the Nike Pro bra collection, which saw exceptional sell through, and iconic franchisees that remain incredibly popular, like our Air Max footwear and sportswear Tech Pack apparel. Lastly, we served these consumers in increasingly dynamic retail environments. We\u2019re experiencing tremendous growth online, led by Nike.com, and in store, driven by sharper assortments and the continued expansion of the Nike Training Club concept to in line stores. And our printed and digital style guides are a key accelerator leading to increased conversion. All told, it is this complete offense that is driving impressive results for our women\u2019s business. Let me turn to a number of our key geographies. First, Western Europe, where our incredible business momentum continued into the first quarter, with revenues up 25%. Our revenue growth was broad-based, with every key category and territory reporting double-digit growth. There is tremendous energy around the brand in Europe, with innovative products that are resonating with consumers. We saw strong results from both performance footwear and apparel, as well as in sportswear. A critical component to unlocking this growth is the work we have done in the marketplace. By creating category specific retail destinations with partners like JD Sports, Foot Locker, and Intersport, we have differentiated the Nike brand with consumers. We also leverage our own DTC business, including Nike.com, as a key component of a segmented marketplace. We continue to evolve our DTC strategy and the market share gains in nearly every territory send a strong signal that our efforts are working. Next, the emerging markets, where revenues increased 10% in the quarter, with most territories growing in Q1. In Brazil, the World Cup was a tremendous success for the Nike brand. Our ability to connect with consumers was unmatched, and our enthusiasm for the long term potential of this critical market remains unchanged. That said, the recent weakening of the Brazilian economy requires us to carefully manage the marketplace, to keep it healthy and productive for Nike and our retail partners. While we are not immune to macro conditions, we are focused on maintaining strong brand momentum and deepening consumer connections as we work to elevate the marketplace for continued growth. In Mexico, as discussed in previous quarters, distribution challenges led to an inconsistent flow of product into the marketplace. While the Nike brand continues to resonate with consumers, inventory levels at retail are higher than we would like given the slower sell through in certain channels. In response, we are carefully managing the flow of product into the marketplace. At the same time, we are working with our wholesale partners to clear excess inventory already in the market. This is to ensure a healthy pull market in Mexico for the long term. By staying closely attuned to consumer and marketplace dynamics, we seize opportunities and address challenges as they arise. Overall, we continue to see tremendous potential for long term profitable growth in the emerging markets. In greater China, we continue to see strength in the Nike brand and positive near term results from our actions to sharpen our product assortments and reset the marketplace. Revenues grew 20% in the quarter, led by 30% comp store growth in our own DTC doors. At the same time, partner doors that have been reset continue to outpace the reporting of the fleet, delivering greater productivity and profitability. As we continue to deliver innovative products and compelling experiences to consumers, and reset additional retail locations, we are confident we can deliver double digit long term growth in this key market. And finally, North America continues to be a growth driver for the company, with Q1 revenues up 12%. North America is a clear example of the incredible results we can drive with the category offense across an integrated marketplace. We saw growth in nearly every dimension of our business : wholesale and DTC, in line, factory, and online, in nearly all key categories and across our men\u2019s, women\u2019s, and young athletes businesses. The category offense is unlocking new areas of growth in North America by serving the unique consumer segments. The more we focus and separate ourselves, the more potential we discover in our largest geography. Ultimately, the strategies we have deployed around the world are working, and the investments we have made are yielding tremendous results. I am proud of the accomplishments, and excited about the opportunities as the momentum of our business continues to accelerate. To put it simply, Q1 was a great quarter, and we\u2019re just getting started. Thanks. Now, here\u2019s Don. Don Blair : Thanks, Trevor. The outstanding results we delivered in Q1 continue to demonstrate the strength of the Nike portfolio, exceeding the expectations we set only 90 days ago. As Mark discussed, these results are the product of aligned strategies and disciplined investments, creating a virtuous cycle, focused investments that deliver strong returns, fueling near term growth and additional investments. As our Q1 results demonstrate, our strategies are delivering great returns and will continue to make targeted investments to drive long term profitable growth. The growth in Q1 was powered by our largest businesses. When our largest businesses have momentum, we\u2019re able to deliver the level of growth and profit leverage we are reporting today. We saw double digit revenue expansion in each of our largest geographies, notably, North America, Western Europe, and China, driven by deeper and more tailored execution of our category offense in each market. Growth in these geographies accelerated in the quarter, and profitability grew faster than revenue. Our Q1 growth was broad-based across categories, with particular strength in our largest performance categories such as basketball, running, and global football, as well as in sportswear. While every product reported higher revenues for the quarter, we posted 18% growth in footwear, our largest and most profitable business. And while we delivered double-digit growth in wholesale revenues, DTC grew even faster. With that introduction, I\u2019ll now recap our Q1 results. Nike Inc. first quarter revenue grew 15% on both a reported and currency neutral basis. Nike brand revenue increased 15%, and Converse revenue increased 16%. Nike brand futures orders grew 14% on a currency neutral basis, driven by a 9% increase in units and a 5% increase in average selling price. The increase was led by double-digit growth in North America and both European geographies, including strong growth in sportswear, basketball, running, and women\u2019s training. On a reported basis, futures grew 11%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly in Japan, Argentina, Russia, and Turkey. First quarter diluted EPS increased 27% to $1.09, driven by strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion, partially offset by increased SG&A investments. EPS also benefited from a lower tax rate and reduced share count, which together accounted for about 9 points of EPS growth. Gross margin increased 170 basis points in the quarter, driven by higher average selling prices, a mix shift to higher margin products, the continued strength of our DTC business, and a modest FX tailwind. Gross margin also benefited from a mix shift to higher margin geographies. These upsides more than offset downward pressure from product input cost inflation. Gross margin for the quarter was better than expected, primarily due to a more significant mix shift to higher margin products and geographies, as well as stronger revenue growth in our DTC business. Driven primarily by World Cup marketing, Q1 demand creation increased 23%, lower growth than we projected 90 days ago. As Trevor noted earlier, our World Cup marketing in Q1 was highly effective, driving energy around the world and across categories. As a result, we decided to shift some demand creation investment to the balance of the year to support upcoming brand and product initiatives. Operating overhead grew 19% in Q1, reflecting investments in DTC, digital innovation, and infrastructure. Other expense net was $3 million for the quarter, down significantly from Q1 of FY14, when exchange rate movements in developing markets led to significant currency conversion losses. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 21.7%, better than expected due to the resolution of tax audits in several jurisdictions and an increase in earnings from operations outside the U.S., which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. Our return on invested capital continues to be strong, as ROIC reached 26.2%, 70 basis points above last year. Inventories at August 31 were up 14% year on year and remained healthy overall, with the majority of the growth driven by North America and Europe, as well as the expansion of our DTC business around the world. Our primary areas of focus for inventory management are Brazil and Mexico, where we continue to balance supply and demand to position those markets for ongoing growth. Now let\u2019s take a look at our performance by segment. In North America, Q1 revenue increased 12% on both a reported and currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in basketball, women\u2019s training, and global football. For the quarter, footwear revenue increased 15%, while apparel grew 10%. Direct-to-consumer revenues increased 22% in Q1, driven by 11% comp store sales growth and significantly higher Nike. com revenues. On a reported basis, Q1 EBIT for North America grew 19%, due to strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion. For Q1, Western Europe revenue grew 25% on a currency neutral basis, with double-digit growth across all territories and categories. As both Mark and Trevor discussed, we\u2019re very pleased with the results of our work to develop an integrated marketplace with engaging, differentiated retail presentations. Both DTC and wholesale revenues advanced strongly for the quarter. On a reported basis for Q1, Western Europe revenue increased 32%, while EBIT jumped 52%, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion, as well as the translation benefit of a stronger euro. In central and eastern Europe, currency-neutral revenues rose 9%, with growth across all key categories except action sports, and all territories except Russia and Israel. We continue to closely monitor the situation in these markets, and remain focused on the things we control, building strong consumer connections, leading with innovative products, and managing a healthy marketplace. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our results in CEE, and remain confident in this geography\u2019s growth prospects. On a reported basis, revenue for CEE grew 7%, but EBIT declined 16%, reflecting FX headwinds, particularly in Russia, lower gross margins, and SG&A investments to support the World Cup. In greater China, currency-neutral revenue grew 20% for the quarter, with double-digit growth in our three largest categories : sportswear, basketball, and running. As Trevor discussed, we\u2019re seeing the results of our strategies to sharpen our product assortments and reset the marketplace. On a reported basis for Q1, China revenue rose 18% while EBIT grew 28% as higher revenues and gross margin expansion more than offset the impact of SG&A investments in DTC and our new Shanghai campus. On our last earnings call, we projected revenues in China to grow at a somewhat faster rate in Q1 than for the full year, due to changes in seasonal product flow and significant variations in prior year comparisons. Q1 growth was even stronger than we expected, due to higher DTC revenue growth and at once sales. We expect these trends to continue, driving FY15 revenue growth for China to a low to mid-teens rate, with the growth heavily weighted to the first half. In the emerging markets, currency neutral revenues increased 10%, reflecting revenue growth in every territory except Mexico and our Latin American distributors. From a category perspective, the growth was led by double-digit growth in sportswear, running, global football, basketball, and women\u2019s training. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue for the emerging markets grew 4%, but EBIT declined 26% as a result of marketing investments in the World Cup and FX headwinds in a number of markets. We remain confident in the significant growth potential of this geography, and as Trevor discussed, we\u2019re focused on doing the right things now to evolve these developing marketplaces and further strengthen our brand to generate sustainable, profitable growth for years to come. First quarter revenue for Converse increased 16% on a reported and currency neutral basis, driven by market conversions in Europe and Asia, as well as continued growth in direct distribution markets such as the U.S. and the U.K. EBIT increased 10% for the quarter, as revenue growth was partially offset by investments in DTC and infrastructure to support the brand\u2019s long term growth and profitability. We entered FY15 with tremendous brand and business momentum that drove outstanding Q1 financial results. Our updated FY15 guidance reflects continued momentum over the remainder of the year, fueling sales growth in revenue and EPS as well as enabling continued investments for sustainable, profitable growth. For revenue, we now expect constant dollar growth for Q2 and full year in the low double digits. This accelerated growth reflects robust consumer demand in our largest markets and categories, with particular strength in our DTC business. Our current outlook for reported revenue growth is 1 to 2 points lower, reflecting the stronger dollar. We now expect gross margin for Q2 to expand by 125 to 150 basis points. This is above our prior expectations, as our strategies to increase average selling prices continue and growth in our higher margin businesses, including DTC, continue to accelerate. These benefits will help to offset increases in product input costs, particularly labor and our actions to clear excess inventory in the emerging markets geography. In addition, given current exchange rates, we expect FX will have a neutral impact on gross margin for the balance of the year, versus the benefit we recorded in Q1. For the full year, we now expect gross margin expansion of about 125 basis points. As both Mark and Trevor discussed earlier, our growth strategies are working, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in them. We expect demand creation to grow at a low double-digit rate for Q2, and at a high single-digit rate for the full year. Operating overhead is expected to grow at a high teens rate for Q2, and at a mid to high teens rate for the full year, reflecting higher variable DTC expenses as well as investments in digital innovation and key operating capabilities. For full year full year 2015, we now expect the effective tax rate will be approximately 24.5%. Overall, assuming no material changes in FX rates, we expect earnings per share to grow at a high teens rate for Q2, and about 20% for the full year, reflecting strong top line momentum and continued gross margin expansion, partially offset by strategic investments in our biggest growth drivers. Q1 was a great start to the fiscal year, and we remain confident in our ability to drive strong growth and deliver shareholder value. We\u2019re now ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from Kate McShane with Citigroup. Kate McShane - Citi : My first question is on China. Don, you had mentioned that you expect the growth to be stronger in the first half than the second half. What happens in the second half that gives you a little less confidence that you can achieve that same level of growth that you expect for the first half? Don Blair : Yeah, it\u2019s really not related to this year\u2019s momentum. It\u2019s really the comparisons to the prior year. We do believe that we\u2019ve really seen fantastic improvement in that marketplace, and so this is not a belief that there\u2019s any lack of momentum in the back half. It\u2019s really the comparisons to the prior year. Kate McShane - Citi : And then my second question has to do with the category offense in Europe. It sounds like women\u2019s is really starting to work very well. And I wondered if, in regards to just the overall category offense in Europe, will we see another wave or another level of category offense for women in Europe now? Or is it all happening concurrently? Trevor Edwards : Just to hit on the category offense, of course, we\u2019re obviously very pleased with the results that we\u2019re seeing in Western Europe. And it really comes back to the decisions we made a couple of years ago, when we decided to really reset the offense and really get focused on the category offense in Western Europe, with a more centralized model which allowed us to get closer to our account and work with them to really help expand the marketplace. So we\u2019re seeing tremendous benefit, actually, come from that. So strong resonance with consumers. Around the women\u2019s business, specifically, yes, we have now, as we said, focused it on our both running, women\u2019s training, as well as our sportswear business. That offense is actually running in Europe. And again, we\u2019re also seeing a really increased drive around sneaker culture, building around women in Western Europe. So we feel very positive about the growth that we\u2019re seeing. And more importantly, we feel very positive about the long term potential of the opportunity in Western Europe and actually around the world. Operator : The next question comes from Omar Saad of ISI Group. Omar Saad - ISI Group : The ecommerce number this quarter was kind of through the roof, the acceleration from last quarter and from last year, off of really kind of a very high growth already. Did something change? Did you open up new markets in terms of the digital ecommerce front? Is there a new logistical capability there? What\u2019s the underlying driver of that pretty significant acceleration? And then is that sustainable? Do you have the logistics and the inventory in place to kind of maintain that type of growth rate there? Mark Parker : We\u2019re very bullish on our ecommerce opportunity. We\u2019ve invested quite heavily in improving our operational capabilities or supply chain. We\u2019re seeing, again, the category offense really resonate through dotcom. Obviously, it is the preferred channel, where a lot of consumers are shifting and moving. Women\u2019s business is up significantly in that mix. Our customization, or Nike ID, up significantly. Running, sportswear, really across the main key categories, we\u2019re seeing tremendous resonance in that channel. This will continue to be a major growth opportunity for Nike, and definitely a source of further investment. We think that the return on this investment will be as strong, frankly, as anywhere we have in the company. Very bullish. Top, top priority for the company, and continued opportunity for growth and profitability. Trevor Edwards : One of the things I\u2019d just add to that would be on, using the category offense, we\u2019re able to basically segment and understand how to grow the running business, the women\u2019s business, each of the different dimensions of the business, so that our teams are squarely focused on doing that. So we think that\u2019s also really helping to accelerate the growth that we\u2019re seeing in the ecommerce business. Omar Saad - ISI Group : Thanks, and then, switch gears on my second question. Around the endorsement strategy, the sports marketing assets, you had some things happen over the last 90 days or so. You were able to keep Kevin Durant. It sounds like the Manchester United contract moved somewhere else. How do you think about it philosophically, strategically, or how should we think about where you want to make those investments, and which cases you might not want to make those investments? Or is there no rule of thumb, it\u2019s really just individual case by case, where you see the opportunities? Trevor Edwards : First, I\u2019ll just start by saying that obviously we believe very much in the power of sport and athletes to inspire people. So we\u2019re obviously very focused behind that. And obviously, some of the things that have been happening, it\u2019s been quite a mix in the marketplace. Obviously, some issues are seriously concerning to us. On the other side, you have some great opportunities with some great athletes like Kevin Durant and our ability to re-sign those athletes. So from our perspective, we really line up how we connect and sign the right athletes, really based on where we see the biggest growth opportunities. We line those two things up and we make sure that we find the athletes and the teams that can inspire consumers and at the same time make sure that we can use that to then drive our business. And we remain singularly focused on that. Mark Parker : You know, the athletes aren\u2019t just a source of or a platform to promote the brand and to get brand exposure. They\u2019re the source of insights that we get. The relationships we have with the athletes are really what drives the innovation that ultimately drives our business and our growth potential. So that\u2019s been there since day one. That will continue to be the case moving forward. Operator : The next question comes from Robert Ohmes from Bank of America. Robert Ohmes - Bank of America : Two questions. The first, so the North American footwear growth, up strong, still up, I think 15%. Any channels of distribution in North America that are outperforming that you could call out? And then the second question is, the sportswear double-digit growth, I think you mentioned it for North America, China, and Europe. Can you remind us how long sportswear has been growing at that rate and when the change was, and what\u2019s driving that acceleration in that part of your business? Trevor Edwards : Around North America first, I would say that obviously we\u2019re seeing great momentum in North America. And we think it continues to demonstrate the power of the category offense. You know, the ability for us to really connect with the consumer to make sure that we can drive the right products into the market, the most innovative products. And we\u2019re seeing incredible sell through amongst all of our products. So really, we\u2019re seeing it across all the different channels. It\u2019s pretty balanced in terms of the strength, so really on every dimension, as we mentioned, we\u2019re just seeing great growth. One of the things, we\u2019re very proud of the relationships that we have with our wholesale partners, our retail partners, because they really are working with us to better dimensionalize the market so we can continue to grow it. So we\u2019re seeing just great growth from that. Then specifically around sportswear, if you recall over the couple years, we\u2019ve certainly seen sportswear business grow double digit. Certainly on the premium part of the business. Where we saw the lagging part was certainly around the more entry priced opportunity. We\u2019re seeing that business really strengthen too. So that\u2019s really helping to buoy the results that you\u2019re seeing around sportswear. So again, it\u2019s when all the pieces start to work together, both footwear, apparel, as well as both the premium and also the entry business. And we\u2019re seeing that really play in all the markets that you mentioned. Operator : Your next question comes from Bob Drbul with Nomura. Bob Drbul - Nomura: The first question that I have is, the DTC up 30, ecommerce up 70, do you believe that you\u2019re seeing any signs of potential cannibalization with your wholesale/retail partners anywhere? Trevor Edwards : No, I wouldn\u2019t say that. Like I mentioned before, the thing that we\u2019ve been able to put in place is this idea of an integrated marketplace. And DTC plays a role that\u2019s been a complementary part of the marketplace. So we\u2019re able to actually bring more dimension to the market by serving unique segments. And that allows the market to be more segmented and more differentiated. And we believe that\u2019s [unintelligible] incredible amounts of growth. The other piece that we\u2019ve talked about is the idea of us being a better retailer ourselves, so we can be a better wholesale partner. And that is actually working, so we\u2019re able to transfer a lot of the learnings that we have done in our own stores, working with our retail partners around the world to accelerate their businesses too. Bob Drbul - Nomura : And my second question is, around the NFL business, can you just comment on sort of the sales trends of the jerseys and the sportswear? And specifically, I can\u2019t seem to find a Richard Sherman jersey for my son, and I was just wondering if you could maybe talk to the process of selection on which athletes you\u2019re choosing for the jerseys these days. Trevor Edwards : [laughs] I will try and find out exactly where your son is and make sure that you can get one. Kelley Hall : Bob, I\u2019ll help you with that. We\u2019ll let Trevor answer the business question. Trevor Edwards : The NFL business continues to perform really well, and so we have a great relationship, a great partnership with the NFL, and we continue to see the jersey business grow. It didn\u2019t grow as fast as it did the prior year, and that\u2019s obviously because we had brought newer uniforms in, but we certainly see good growth in our NFL business. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Duffy of Stifel. Jim Duffy - Stifel Nicolaus : The first, increases in ASPs in the futures has been really impressive. What are the ongoing opportunities in ASP, and what\u2019s your feeling on the sustainability of that trend? And then secondly, what are some of the opportunities in the supply chain for efficiencies to offset some of the inflationary inputs that you\u2019re seeing? Trevor Edwards : Certainly on the pricing side, what I would say is that, you know, we have been really focused on ensuring that we give the consumer the best value, and we really start there. And we\u2019re making sure that, given the strength of our brand and the power of the innovation that we bring into the products, that we have the ability to really command a premium price. And we\u2019re able to do that not only in individual markets, because we work specifically in each market, to make sure that we\u2019re paying attention to the market dynamics so that we can obviously give the consumer the most value. Mark Parker : And I think, Jim, on your second question, about the supply chain, we\u2019re working really across the whole supply chain and harvesting opportunities all the way from manufacturing modernization and implementation of things like Lean manufacturing or improved human resource practices in the factories, doing some factory automation, as I said, all the way to more revolutionary technologies like Flyknit. We\u2019re also continuing to work on streamlining the whole supply chain and making sure that we\u2019re matching up the supply and demand as tightly as possible, which reduces closeouts and maximizes margins. So there\u2019s a tremendous number of opportunities. We feel that we\u2019re going to be able to continue to take advantage of some of those things as we work to offset input cost inflation. Don Blair : Let me add that the manufacturing revolution focus is a big one for us. It\u2019s not only a place where we can see some margin opportunity by scaling some of these innovations that are really, in a sense, game-changing. And we\u2019re talking beyond Flyknit. We\u2019re on the verge of moving some other what we call man rev, or manufacturing revolution innovations to a much larger scale. So there\u2019s a great opportunity there. And those processes actually allow us to create products that are more innovative at the same time, to actually improve performance while we actually get some margin opportunity at the same time. Jim Duffy - Stifel Nicolaus : Some of the increase we\u2019re seeing in ASP, is that a function of the supply chain, just better managing the flow of inventory and having less discounting? Don Blair : We have seen some benefit to that in most parts of the world, certainly. But I think as Trevor said earlier, the improvements in ASP are really two things. It\u2019s really the value equation and how we approach the consumer from a pricing standpoint. It\u2019s also the tremendous strength at the top end of the market, the premium end of the market, driven by innovation. So if you look at the mix of our product, it\u2019s really been extraordinarily strong at the premium end. And it\u2019s really, as Trevor said, the value of putting the brand, the product, and then compelling retail distribution in place, which lets you shift the market to premium and maximize price. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS. Michael Binetti - UBS: You\u2019ve told us the story about Western Europe a bit and made the analogy to the category offense strategy that you put in in the U.S., and I think you\u2019ve injected a lot of those disciplines so far over there. But can we maybe talk a little bit about some of the similarities you\u2019re been able to capture, and maybe some of the differences as you are now, I would say, in the middle innings of rolling that out in Europe? And maybe as we think longer term about Western Europe, it\u2019s growing very well, but you\u2019ve seen higher margins there in the past. That obviously looks like an opportunity. Is there an opportunity there to push above prior peaks with the category offense, like you did in the U.S.? Or do you think that for now that market still needs some investment to get to what you think the potential is? Trevor Edwards : Around Western Europe, and speaking about the similarities, the first thing I\u2019d say, for example, what we did see earlier, we saw certainly a very rapid growth of our running business in North America. And we saw that we were able to really grow the running market in a substantial way. We saw that Western Europe was trailing in that respect. We\u2019re now seeing that actually take place in Western Europe. So as an example, we\u2019re seeing a lot of the ideas and a lot of the things that were done in North America really play the same way in Western Europe. Having said that, we do execute sometimes slightly differently in some of those marketplaces. So recognizing where the consumer is different or they might approach it from a different perspective, we do make sure that we have tailored product offerings that will meet that specific consumer\u2019s need in that marketplace. The other part is just a matter of, we\u2019re still in early days. And so when you think about, we\u2019ve got running rolled out, we\u2019ve obviously got an incredible focus on footwear, we\u2019re amplifying our business in terms of how we think about our category business. And then when you drill it down and you go into our markets within Western Europe, you can only see more growth opportunities. So we\u2019re seeing great growth come out of Germany. We\u2019re seeing great growth come out of the U.K. So it\u2019s really a matter of, we think about that as a portfolio in and of itself. And that\u2019s what we believe helps us to continue to see even further growth. But we see tremendous potential in this marketplace, and we\u2019re only just scratching the surface. Mark Parker : We have a lot of confidence around our ability to leverage and scale best practices around the world, but then also, at the other end, to tailor our product and marketing as needed, even down to the city level. So it\u2019s that combination, I think, that is really a part of Nike\u2019s strength and our potential. Michael Binetti - UBS : If I could ask you one follow up. You guys have really obviously been focused on pricing, and we see the numbers go by with your new disclosure, how much that\u2019s adding to the gross margins quarter to quarter. Could you talk about the pricing strategy a little bit there? And what I find to be counterintuitive is how you guys are getting such a nice benefit from pricing while a lot of other categories in the U.S. in particular are seeing pricing pressure. How do you think about policing that to make sure you\u2019re protecting from overheating down the road, as you think about your higher level pricing strategy? Trevor Edwards : A couple of things there. I think one of the things that we, I think, did a number of years ago is we really embedded pricing into the way that we do the business every single day. So we\u2019re working on pricing at a style by style level and a market by market level, and making sure that ultimately we deliver the value to the consumer. At the same time, we do believe the power of our brand, and our ability to bring more innovation to the market, is really helping to drive a premium position. And we\u2019ve seen it really in every market around the world where the consumer is definitely trending towards premium products. Well made with great innovation is certainly resonating with the consumers. : Mark Parker : And I\u2019d add one other thing too. In our organization, the people who are really on the front lines from a pricing and a consumer value standpoint are the merchants. So this is a set of decisions that the people who are at the marketplace are really driving that strategy. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Tracy with Janney Capital Markets. Eric Tracy - Janney Capital Markets : Mark, if I could follow up on the commentary on the manufacturing revolution. Completely agree with it being potentially game changing. And I think this was kind of the first time we had heard the potential that that could be sooner rather than kind of a long term opportunity. Could you just speak to, again, specifically beyond Flyknit, is it 3D printing, is it other disruptive technologies that are in play? Again, the timing of when you might be able to scale that and what that level of penetration might look like? Mark Parker : Yeah, I\u2019m not going to go into great detail here and now, but I will say that these breakthroughs really come in the shorter term, the midterm, and the long term. You know, we\u2019ve got a steady flow of innovations beyond Flyknit to speed up our manufacturing, to make the whole process of manufacturing more efficient, more sustainable, and offset some of those higher input costs. Specifically, 3D printing, that has a tremendous opportunity for us. That\u2019s a bit on the longer road side of things. But we intend to be on the forefront of that potential. And there\u2019s other things that I don\u2019t want to get into at this point, that will start to make a more meaningful impact over the next one to three years. Eric Tracy - Janney Capital Markets : And then maybe if I could switch gears, as we think about heading into the Brazil Olympics, clearly a little bit of a macro downtick there as well as just some of the distribution issues across the Latin America region. How do we think about managing the emerging market business into that. Do you double down from an investment in sort of demand creation standpoint? Do you manage back on that? Again, it\u2019s much bigger in terms of showcasing the Nike brand on a global level, but anything kind of region specific we should think about into that event? Trevor Edwards : I\u2019d say first that the brand is very strong in Brazil. It\u2019s very strong in Latin America. And in fact, the World Cup obviously was a great example of, it was a tremendous success for us. I think what you\u2019re seeing around Latin America right now is certainly some macroeconomic headwinds that we\u2019re working through. And what we\u2019re essentially trying to do is make sure that we\u2019re taking prudent steps to proactively manage the flow of product into the marketplace. To make sure that the market can actually remain healthy for both us as well as for our retail partners. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019re doing. So it\u2019s more about making sure that we balance it. For the long term, we are tremendously enthusiastic about the opportunity that lies in the Brazilian market and in Latin America. Very high sports markets. Consumers have a very good passion for the brand and certainly passion for sport. So we really are very bullish about that market long term. Kelley Hall : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : The next question comes from David Weiner with Deutsche Bank. David Weiner - Deutsche Bank : I wanted to ask about the North American running business. I think you gave some color on some of the footwear and apparel SKUs, products that did well. But I was wondering if you could dig a little bit deeper into the consumer and kind of what are they looking for in product, and if that\u2019s changing at all as we go into the holidays. And then also, I\u2019m not sure if you gave a performance number for how North American run did, but if you could, that would be great. Trevor Edwards : Around running, obviously running is our heritage, and it\u2019s obviously our largest performance category. And we continue to see great growth in our running business. In fact, the running business grew double digits this year on top of double digits last year. So it certainly is still driving. What we\u2019re seeing in the category of running, certainly around runners, we\u2019re obviously seeing the women\u2019s business grow at a great clip. So we\u2019re seeing strong growth among the women\u2019s business, but also amongst the premium business. So that consumer continues to want more dimension, I would say. And also, we\u2019re seeing great things like focus on technology and certainly the focus on color. And all those things are starting to drive that marketplace. The other part to the running business is also the apparel. We\u2019re seeing a great growth around premium apparel in running. Now, the one area that, again, we continue to see opportunity for is strengthening our product line, certainly around the lower price points. And this is what Mark always speaks about, the complete offense. And this is the opportunity where we can really focus in more around our core business and really make sure that we strengthen that. But all in all, the running business is still strong. And we obviously can see the pipeline that\u2019s going to be coming, so we feel very confident about the continuation of driving the running business in North America. Don Blair : And unfortunately, we do not give category level information for our geographies. Kelley Hall : :",

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nike\u2019s fiscal 2015 second quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today\u2019s call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website, investors.nike.com. Joining us on today\u2019s call will be Nike, Inc. President and CEO Mark Parker, followed by Trevor Edwards, president of the Nike brand, and finally, you will hear from our chief financial officer, Don Blair, who will give you an in-depth review of our financial results. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event you have additional questions not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your help with this. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Nike, Inc. President and CEO Mark Parker. Mark Parker : Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone, and happy holidays. Q2 was another outstanding quarter for Nike, and it demonstrates our ability to continue to drive strong, profitable, sustainable growth. For the quarter, Nike Inc. revenues increased 15% to $7.4 billion. Gross margin expanded 120 basis points, diluted earnings per share increased 25% to $0.74, and we continue to deliver strong returns as our ROIC reached 27% and we increased our dividend for the 13th year in a row. Delivering results like these requires a sharp focus on our growth opportunities, making disciplined choices to invest in those areas with the highest potential for return. The world of sport is constantly evolving as is the environment in which we operate. That opens up new opportunities for Nike every day. But to identify and capitalize on those opportunities, we have to stay nimble. We need to balance making critical investments with managing risks, whether they be currency headwinds, commodity cost fluctuations, or an evolving political landscape. The word \u201cbalance\u201d is key. To capture the tremendous growth potential we see for Nike, we must invest, and a targeted approach to making the right investments helps us drive growth and manage risk. It\u2019s a winning strategy that has allowed us to deliver profitable, sustainable growth quarter after quarter, year after year. You know, I\u2019m often asked how we can continue to grow, how there could still be places where Nike isn\u2019t fully distributed. When I look at the potential in our business, I actually see the exact opposite. The more we focus on knowing, connecting, and serving the consumer, the more opportunity I see for growth and when we capture those opportunities by leveraging the power of the Nike Inc. portfolio. Let\u2019s take apparel as an example. Today, Nike is one of the largest apparel brands in the world. But as we look up and down our apparel business, we see tremendous opportunity, from premium performance apparel to signature sportswear styles, from running, to basketball, to global football, from North America, to Western Europe, to China, from the Nike brand to Brand Jordan, to Converse, across men\u2019s, women\u2019s, and young athletes. And within each of those dimensions, we segment further and further to find even more opportunity to drive growth. Our diverse set of brands, categories, geographies, product types, and distribution channels provides a competitive advantage that is unmatched, and our relentless focus on serving the consumer allows us to see ever-expanding opportunities for growth within our existing portfolio. Trevor will talk in more depth about our growth drivers in the Nike brand, but let me highlight two additional areas that we\u2019ve been investing in to accelerate growth in our business. First, our women\u2019s business. In October, I was honored to be a part of a powerful moment for Nike Women\u2019s. We introduced our spring/summer 2015 collections in New York City with 27 of the world\u2019s top athletes. It was amazing to have Grand Slam winners, world record holders, and Olympic champions all in one place at the same time. We were also there to spotlight an important cultural shift that\u2019s happening, and sport is powering women\u2019s lives like never before. We see it every day in our digital community of 65 million women, and women are driving a larger global movement of health and fitness. They\u2019re running in record numbers, they\u2019re engaging in new kinds of workouts and athletic activities at a rapid pace, and that means they have new needs, which are creating new insights and inspiring new products and services. And by staying focused on the needs of the consumer, we\u2019re driving growth in our women\u2019s business. There is tremendous energy in women\u2019s and a significant opportunity for us in this important business. Second is our digital strategy. We see digital as an integrated ecosystem of digital communication with consumers, digital products and services to inspire and motivate, and of course ecommerce. All three dimensions work together to deliver premium personalized experiences for our consumers and drive growth for Nike. Consumers are engaging with technology in new ways. It\u2019s transforming the sport experience and the way in which we connect with them. Athletes are getting a better understanding of themselves and their potential than they\u2019ve ever had before, and we\u2019re able to connect personally with more consumers than ever. Digital is where the consumer is today, and where they will be going forward, and we\u2019re excited about the potential of leveraging digital technology to further drive innovation and continue to deliver increasingly seamless digital experiences for our consumers. Going a little bit deeper on ecommerce, it continues to deliver, with growth of 65% for the quarter. Our investments in infrastructure are really paying off in this space. We\u2019re making it easier for consumers to buy our products and we\u2019re presenting the brand in the most premium way. With opportunity for even more innovation and expansion into new markets, this really is just the beginning of what\u2019s possible for Nike.com. Ecommerce is, without a doubt, one of our biggest and most important growth opportunities, and it will be for years to come. One of the reasons I\u2019m so confident in our growth potential for Nike.com, and really, across our entire portfolio, is because Nike is relentless. We are always striving to deliver something better for the athlete and the consumer. We are, in a word, obsessed, and that obsession fuels innovation. Since day one, we\u2019ve looked to athletes as a source of inspiration, and that hasn\u2019t changed. What has changed is the pace at which athletes demand more of themselves. As they strive for new levels of performance, they demand products that help them get stronger, faster, and more agile, really better in every way. And that pushes us to deliver innovative products and services that go beyond what anyone thought was possible. And it requires us to accelerate the pace of our innovation, to improve not only what we make, but how we make it. Today, we have tools and resources available to us that would have been unimaginable five years ago, from 3D printers, to high-performance knitting machines, to advanced textiles, just to name a few. And we\u2019re not only focused on the quantum leaps in product innovation. Equally exciting is our focus on continuously evolving our existing and proven performance technologies. Nike Air continues to be reinvented, as does Nike Free, Lunar, and Tech Fleece. We create products that are completely new and we make our existing products better. We introduce game-changing innovation in every category in every global market, and at scale. No one else can deliver innovation like Nike can, and that is our greatest competitive advantage as a company. Our ability to leverage and scale this innovation through compelling concepts and technologies across our portfolio of brands and categories, geographies and distribution channels, and on the world\u2019s best athletes and teams, is driving tremendous growth for Nike around the world. And while I\u2019m proud of the results we\u2019re reporting today, I assure you that we are hungry, we\u2019re driven, and we are laser focused on the future. Our success lies in our ability to see what is possible and then relentlessly pursue it, to stay aggressive always, and remembering, as we say every day here at Nike, the consumer decides. Our business has breadth and depth at a scale that is unmatched in our industry, and we have the leadership team and the strategy to drive sustainable growth. That is what you\u2019ve seen from Nike in the past and that is what you can continue to expect from us going forward. Thanks, and now here\u2019s Trevor. Trevor Edwards : Thank you, Mark. Happy holidays, everyone. Our strong second quarter results demonstrate the tremendous momentum of the Nike brand. Let\u2019s take a look at the numbers. On a constant currency basis, Nike brand revenue grew 17%. All geographies grew in the quarter, as did all categories except golf. The Nike brand DTC revenue increased 30%, driven by all concepts. Notably, our online business continues to be very strong, with 66% growth in the quarter, and global futures are up 11%, even as we anniversary the strong World Cup order in the prior year. The reason we deliver strong growth across our geographies and categories time and time again is clear. We never lose focus on serving our consumers. As always, these strong relationships are fueled by the power of our brands and the category offence. As we\u2019ve discussed before, the category offense deepens our relationship with consumers by serving them through the lens of sport that matters most to them, as they compete, train, and express themselves. In other words, we live where they live. What\u2019s more, only Nike has the broad portfolio and global reach to execute this strategy around the world. We know what works, and we know how to identify large, untapped opportunities, develop innovative products and marketing strategies on a global scale, and execute them effectively in each marketplace around the world. Now let\u2019s look at two examples of the category offense at work : basketball and our women\u2019s business. It\u2019s no secret why we succeed in basketball. Our relationship with the world\u2019s best athletes provide us great insight that produce incredible product innovation, and these products, in turn, excite and inspire consumers all over the world. Q2 was the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for our basketball category. Our position as the world\u2019s leader in basketball was supported by strong sell through of key Nike basketball footwear styles like the LeBron 12 and the KD7. And the Jordan brand remains a powerful growth driver, with performance products like the Air Jordan 29 as well as rereleases like the Retro Jordan 6. You can see this energy come to life with growth throughout the marketplace, from performance to sportswear, and across footwear and apparel styles. Retail destinations like our own DTC stores or the House of Hoops, with Footlocker, remain go-to locations for those who love the sport. And momentum in this category is not limited to North America. We\u2019re also seeing great consumer response to basketball retail destinations in Europe and China, which help us realize the significant potential of these growing markets. Now let\u2019s take a look at the women\u2019s business. As Mark mentioned, the momentum we\u2019re seeing in this business is incredible. The energy was certainly visible at our recent women\u2019s event in New York. I will never forget the thrill of seeing some of the world\u2019s greatest athletes, including Li Na, Allyson Felix, and Skylar Diggins discussing their successes and the power of women in sports. It was truly inspiring. Look forward, we remain on the path to meet our goal of a $7 million women\u2019s business by fiscal year 2017. We achieve this by making deep connections with consumers in the areas most important to them : running, training, and sportswear. Our strategy means connecting and serving millions of women through the digital platforms, elevating the online and in-store shopping experiences, offering premium product assortments that drive real growth and as always, leading with innovative products. These products offer consumer great fit and amazing style like never before, and they\u2019re presented at retail in a compelling and captivating way. Great product examples from the quarter include the Nike Pro Base Layer collection and the continued strength of the Nike Pro bra as well as performance inspired style of the Air Max collection. What\u2019s more, we opened women\u2019s-only Nike stores in Newport Beach and Shanghai to strong consumer response. Ultimately, we see Q2 as just the beginning of great things to come in our women\u2019s business. Now let\u2019s turn to a few of our key geographies. In North America, we delivered another great quarter with Q2 revenue growth of 16%. That growth proves yet again the success of our strategies. For us, North America offers a roadmap for other geographies as we continue to deliver strong growth in this critical marketplace. By developing deep consumer relationships through the category offense, and delivering segmented and differentiated retail destination, we have driven sustained, profitable growth even in more developed markets where we already have significant market share. Our brand continues to resonate with consumers in North America, which is driving growth in nearly every category. Basketball, sportswear, and men\u2019s training have continued to perform well, and we\u2019ve seen clear acceleration in our women\u2019s and young athletes businesses. Working with our partners, we\u2019ve continued to see growth as we further transform the marketplace. In executions such as the Field House, with Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, the Track Club, at the Finish Line, and the young athletes concept Fly Zone with Foot Locker. Additionally, our DTC business has continued to expand, with an increase of 18% in Q2. By providing the products and the experiences our consumers demand, we expect to continue to drive growth in our largest geography. In greater China, we continue to see the benefits of our strategy to reset the marketplace. Q2 revenue growth of 21% reflects our plan to deploy a more consumer centric distribution strategy, and this approach is definitely working. The Nike brand is exceptionally strong with consumers in China, and we hold the number one market share position in both athletic footwear and apparel. Our leadership position as a premium performance brand allows us to present the innovative products in the most compelling retail destinations in the marketplace. As a result, our whole partners have continued to see strong comp store growth and expanding profitability in the doors that have been reprofiled. This success mirrors the exceptional numbers we\u2019ve seen in our own doors. We\u2019ve driven this return to growth by focusing on increased retail productivity, differentiating our point of distribution and creating more focused consumer experiences. This allows us to provide a narrow but deep product assortment in each door. This better serves the consumer and also allows us to maintain the healthy inventory levels we are currently seeing in the market. We remain confident that we have the right strategy to drive a sustainable, profitable growth in China over the long term. Now let\u2019s turn to the emerging markets, which delivered 13% revenue growth in the quarter, every territory except Mexico and Korea, with five of them growing at a double digit rate. We also saw strong performance coming from sportswear and basketball categories in the quarter. As we\u2019ve discussed, inventory levels in Mexico remain high. This is primarily the result of an inconsistent flow of product to our wholesale partners following transition issues with our distribution center in the early fiscal year 2014. We continue to work aggressively to clear excess inventory and expect to return to more normalized levels by the end of fiscal year 2015. As with every territory in the world, our goal is to operate a healthy [pull] market, and we believe we are taking the necessary actions to achieve that goal in Mexico. In Brazil, Q2 revenue growth slowed, as volatile macroeconomic conditions make for a more challenging environment. That said, we see this environment as an opportunity to do what we do best, accelerate our transformation of the marketplace, fueled by the category offense. The consumer\u2019s passion for sport and the Nike brand remain strong, and we are focused on creating elevated and differentiated retail experiences for our consumers in Brazil, as we have done in North America, Western Europe, and China. Online executions through Nike.com will serve as the most premium expression of the brand, offering rich product assortments across a broad range of categories. We are also working with our wholesale partners to create compelling destinations at retail, with a focus on our biggest categories : running, football, and sportswear. Near term, we are working to keep the market healthy in Brazil. We are proactively managing the flow of product into the marketplace, whilst also swiftly working to clear any excess inventory through the closeout channel. Long term, we remain confident that the emerging markets geography will drive significant growth for the Nike brand. Lastly, let\u2019s take a look at Western Europe. With revenue up 24% in the quarter, we continue to see strong momentum for the Nike brand. The exceptional growth was driven by our relentless focus on the consumer and our work to transform the marketplace in line with the category offense. We continue to develop more differentiated retail executions, both in our stores and with our wholesale partners, while continuing to flow amazing products into the marketplace. All this combined to expand the market and help us take market share. Wholesale partners like Foot Locker, JD Sports, and Intersport are creating compelling category destinations in cities across the geography that are fueling growth. And just as we\u2019ve seen in North America, our DTC business in Western Europe also continues to perform very well, delivering 40% growth in the quarter. This resulted in a double digit revenue growth in every territory and strong growth across nearly every category, with sportswear, football, and running leading the way. Western Europe is a perfect example of the tremendous opportunity that lies ahead for the Nike brand to drive long term growth. As we finish the first half of the year, the Nike brand has never been stronger. By staying focused on the needs of the consumer, we have driven exceptional revenue and profit growth. While we feel great about the results we\u2019ve delivered to date, we\u2019re never satisfied. Like the athletes we serve, our focus is always on continuing to elevate our performance, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do in the second half of the year and beyond. Thanks, now here\u2019s Don. Don Blair : Thanks, Trevor. You\u2019ve often heard us use the phrase, \u201cNike is a growth company.\u201d Over our history, we\u2019ve delivered sustained growth in revenues, profits, and cash returns to shareholders. The level we\u2019ve delivered in recent years is particularly distinctive in today\u2019s highly volatile and growth challenged environment, but the phrase is more than a description of the results we\u2019ve produced. It\u2019s a key element of our business philosophy. Nike as a growth company is embodied in the Nike maxims, the principles we use to define our corporate culture. Nike is a growth company means that our potential is continuously expanding, and that the numbers, like the current size of a market or a previous peak profit margin, are only signposts, not limits. It means we can create growth by investing to build deep personal connections with athletes and consumers, by investing to deliver exceptional product innovations and by investing to create premium integrated marketplaces. And Nike as a growth company means we can leverage our global portfolio and operating capabilities to deliver sustainable, profitable growth, manage risk, and create shareholder value. With that introduction, I\u2019ll now recap our Q2 results. Second quarter reported revenue for Nike Inc. increased 15%. On a currency neutral basis, revenue increased 18%, as the Nike brand grew 17% and Converse increased 24%. Also on a currency neutral basis, Nike brand futures ordered grew 11%, driven by a 6% increase in average selling price and a 5% increase in units. The growth reflects continued strong demand for the Nike brand, even as we anniversary robust prior year orders for global football product in advance of the 2014 World Cup. Excluding global football, total futures order growth this quarter was essentially in line with the numbers we reported last quarter. Specifically, this quarter\u2019s futures growth was led by double digit expansion in North America, Europe, and Greater China, with strong demand across multiple categories including sportswear, basketball, and running. On a reported basis, futures grew 7%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly the euro, Argentine peso, ruble, and yen. Second quarter diluted EPS increased 25% to $0.74, driven by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and a lower share count, partially offset by higher SG&A investments. Gross margin expanded 120 basis points in the quarter. The increase was driven by a mix shift to higher margin products, continued growth in our higher margin DTC business, and a modest benefit from FX, partially offset by higher product input costs. Second quarter demand creation spending increased 11%, driven by digital brand marketing, sports marketing, and consumer events around the globe. Q2 operating overhead increased 19%, reflecting growth in our higher gross margin and higher cost DTC business, targeted investments in operational infrastructure, and continued investments in digital, including consumer engagement. The Q2 effective tax rate was 25.4%, a 20 basis point increase, primarily due to adjustments to tax expense on intercompany transactions and the benefit realized in the prior period from the U.S. R&D Tax Credit. These items were partially offset by an increase in earnings from operations outside the U.S., which are generally subject to a lower tax rate and the resolution of tax audits across multiple jurisdictions. Inventories at November 30 were up 11% and remain healthy overall, with the majority of the growth in North America, Europe, and Converse, and driven in part by the expansion of our DTC business. We continue to focus on inventory management, with particular attention on Brazil and Mexico, where we\u2019re working to balance supply and demand to position those markets for ongoing growth. Now let\u2019s take a look at some performance highlights by segment. In North America, Q2 revenue increased 16% on both a reported and currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in the basketball, sportswear, men\u2019s training, and women\u2019s training categories. Direct to consumer revenues grew 18%, driven by 8% comp store sales growth, continued strong growth of Nike.com, and new stores. On a reported basis, Q2 EBIT for North America grew 21%, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion. In Western Europe, Q2 revenues increased 24% on a currency neutral basis. The growth was broad-based, as every territory increased at a double digit rate. Every key category also grew, led by double-digit growth for sportswear, football, and running. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue for Western Europe increased 22%. Second quarter EBIT increased 112%, driven primarily by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and SG&A leverage. EBIT growth for Western Europe also benefited from two nonoperating items : a legal charge included in last year\u2019s Q2 results, and more favorable standardized exchange rates that we use for our geography segment reporting. The latter upside was largely offset within the corporate segment of our consolidated results. Revenue in Central and Eastern Europe accelerated in the quarter, expanding 25% on a currency neutral basis. Excluding Israel, every territory reported double digit revenue growth, and every key category expanded, except action sports. Despite strong FX headwinds, reported revenue for CEE grew 17%, and EBIT grew 19%, driven by strong revenue growth and SG&A leverage. In Greater China, currency neutral and reported revenue grew 21%, led by double-digit growth in sportswear, running, and basketball. As Trevor discussed, the Nike brand continues to lead the market, and we\u2019re pleased with the results of our work to reset the marketplace for sustainable, profitable growth. On a reported basis, Q2 EBIT in greater China increased 31%, driven by strong revenue growth and significant gross margin expansion, partially offset by increased investments in DTC and our new Shanghai campus. Given the continuing benefits of our strategy to reset the market, we now expect full year FY15 revenue in China to grow at a mid-teens rate. In the emerging markets geography, Q2 revenue grew 13% on a currency neutral basis, as all territories except Mexico and Korea posted higher revenues. From a category perspective, the growth was led by sportswear, basketball, and running. Reported Q2 results in the emerging markets geography reflected the translation and gross margin impact of strong FX headwinds, as reported revenue increased only 4% and EBIT decreased 3%. The reduction in profitability was primarily due to lower gross margin and higher operating overhead for new retail stores. We continue to be confident in the long term growth potential for the territories that comprise our emerging markets geography, and as Trevor discussed earlier, we\u2019re executing plans in each of them to realize that potential. For Converse, revenue grew 24% on a currency neutral basis, driven by continued strength in existing direct distribution markets such as the U.S., the growth of DTC, and market conversions in Europe and Asia. On a reported basis, revenue increased 21% but EBIT decreased 12%, driven by investments in infrastructure, demand creation, and DTC to enable long term growth. Over the last 90 days, we\u2019ve seen our business performance accelerate and we expect that trend to continue into the second half of fiscal 2015. At the same time, the dollar has strengthened against most other currencies and the FX markets have been extremely volatile. While our trading company structure and hedge programs do protect us from some of that volatility, we cannot entirely eliminate all FX risk. Based on what we know today, we expect the net impact of these two factors, the strengthening currency neutral business performance and the downside from the stronger dollar, will net together to deliver full year results largely in line with the expectations we shared 90 days ago. Specifically, for Q3 we expect constant dollar revenue growth in the low teens, with reported revenue growth of about 3 points lower, reflecting the stronger dollar. For the full year, we expect constant dollar revenue growth in the low double-digits, with reported revenue growth 2 to 3 points lower. We expect gross margin for Q3 to expand by about 100 basis points. Growth in our higher margin businesses, including DTC, and strategies to increase average selling prices will continue into the second half of the year. These benefits will help to offset increases in product input costs, our actions to clear excess inventory in the emerging markets, and increased FX pressure. For the full year, we now expect gross margin expansion of 100 to 125 basis points. We expect demand creation to grow at a high single to low double digit rate for Q3, and at a high single-digit rate for the full year. Operating overhead is now expected to grow at a high teens rate for Q3 and the full year, reflecting higher variable DTC expenses as well as investments in digital innovation, new operating capabilities, and expanded capacity. We continue to expect the effective tax rate for FY15 will be approximately 24.5%. As you\u2019ve heard from all three of us today, we\u2019re pleased with the results we\u2019ve delivered in the first half of FY15 and the momentum we see in our business. And notwithstanding the volatility we\u2019ve seen recently in the macro-environment, we\u2019re confident we\u2019re on track to deliver strong growth for this fiscal year. We\u2019re now ready to take your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions.] The first question is from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : I just really wanted to ask a follow up question on the gross margin line, Don. It\u2019s still great expansion year over year. I think maybe you missed your projection for the second quarter a little bit. Kind of wondering, what are the swing factors quarter to quarter near term? Is it FX and input costs, and then if those are the two big factors, we can see FX, but how should we be thinking about oil and some of the other input costs that go in there? Don Blair : Well, first of all, we gave a range on gross margin and our actual results were really essentially in line with that range. And as we\u2019ve talked about before, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts in gross margin. As we look forward with gross margin, FX is one of the things that\u2019s changing between the second quarter and where we expect the third quarter to be. As I said in my prepared remarks, we had a very small FX upside in Q2, basically because of our hedge positions. For FY15 Q3, so next quarter, we are expecting that to start turning into a headwind. So yes, FX is the major driver. When you look at the underlying fundamentals of gross selling price improvements versus input costs, we\u2019re continuing to make great progress from an operating standpoint on expanding margins. Operator : The next question is from Robbie Ohms with Bank of America. Robert Ohmes : Don, you called out in gross margin one of the drivers as mix shift to higher margin products. Can we get some insight into are you speaking about higher margins on some of the new apparel you\u2019re doing? Or is it certain sneaker styles? What type of products are you mix shifting towards? And the second question was, I might have missed it, but you guys called out a lot of great things with momentum, but I don\u2019t remember hearing Nike Free, or the word Fly Knit, or running in the U.S., but I just wanted to double check if I maybe missed something on one of those three things. Don Blair : So, on your first question, this is a trend that we\u2019ve seen for quite a while now, which is that with the strength of our brand and the flow of innovation we have into the marketplace, we have been essentially trading the consumer up to premium product. And that\u2019s both on the apparel and the footwear side. So it\u2019s things like Tech Fleece on the sportswear front in apparel or just generally the performance apparel we\u2019ve seen in running, as well as a number of other performance categories. And on the footwear side, it\u2019s marquee footwear styles, running, basketball, sportswear. So what this is is that long term trend to building product that\u2019s premium for the consumer and can carry that price premium. And I\u2019m going to hand the second question off to Trevor. Trevor Edwards : Yeah, I\u2019ll jump in there. Obviously, as we go through the results, there\u2019s a number of categories and dimensions of the business, so we always try and give you maybe just some different flavors as to how the business is doing. So maybe speaking specifically about running, we feel good about the running category. It\u2019s our biggest category and it\u2019s what we always described as we really operate the complete offense. In terms of growth, for the quarter we actually saw mid to high single digit pace growth in the second quarter. In terms of the growth, it was actually pretty widespread. We saw particular strength in Europe as well as in China. In Europe, both dimensions of Europe, so Central Eastern Europe as well as Western Europe. When you dive down specifically into North America, what we have been seeing, which is really across the board, our premium products are doing exceptionally well across the marketplace. And so all the premium products, whether it\u2019s the Structure, the Pegasus, the Lunar Glides, those are all doing really well. Where we have opportunity is really more in the lower price points and we are actively working to get onto that, and so we are bringing better products in the marketplace, and we will be doing that. But all in all, we feel very good about our running business across the board, but clearly there\u2019s some opportunity for us to continue to make sure we sharpen our focus along the lines of the complete offense. Mark Parker : As far as the Free and Fly Knit innovation from Nike, as I said before, I continue to be very bullish on both those areas of our innovation agenda. I recently spent time in our advanced R&D looking at some of the new concepts coming down the pipe here, some sooner than later. Very exciting developments in the free category as well as Fly Knit. And we continue to be as bullish as we ever have been on the potential, as far as both those areas are concerned. Operator : The next question is from Bob Drbul with Nomura. Bob Drbul : The first one is, I think the China growth, I think you now are looking for midteens. I think that\u2019s an improvement from the prior outlook. And I just wondered if you could elaborate a little bit more in terms of what\u2019s developing there, how everything is going on the footwear side and the apparel side. Trevor Edwards : Yeah, great question, obviously. You know, as we\u2019ve always been talking about, we\u2019ve implemented a reset strategy in China, and we feel very confident that the reset strategy is working, as you could see certainly with the growth of 21%. We felt great about that result. We also see futures up 13% as a very good indication that all our strategies are in place and we\u2019re building them into the fundamentals of the business. And so as you\u2019ll remember, the key to the strategy was making sure that we would drive more profitable and productive retail, and so we\u2019re seeing both of those dimensions really hit. Both were actually increasing the sell through of product, but it\u2019s also at a much more profitable rate. So we feel that we\u2019re actually doing all the things that we\u2019ve talked about. We feel very good about the continued trend on the China business. The metrics continue to show that when you look into working with our partners, their doors continue to profile really well. So again, we feel very good and the inventories in the marketplace are very clean. So all the dimensions of those businesses will suggest that we will continue to see continued strong growth in China. Mark Parker : I\u2019ll just add that the strength of the brand in China is tremendous. The response to the product that we\u2019ve introduced is also quite strong. We\u2019ve obviously made measures to increase our productivity at retail, and we\u2019re leveraging that across both our own doors and our partner doors in China. So we\u2019re very excited about all of that. And then as Trevor said, the inventory situation is actually quite good. So we\u2019re bullish on the opportunity, and I\u2019ll mention too that we just launched dot com here less than about seven months ago in China, and the response there has exceeded our expectations. So that\u2019s another great opportunity for us. Bob Drbul : And I just have a quick follow up question. Can you just elaborate on the plans, as you think about FY15 versus next year, how are you guys going to comp against the success that the Ducks have had, and the Heisman Trophy winner from the University of Oregon? Mark Parker : [laughter] That\u2019s a good one. That\u2019s a tough one to beat. We\u2019re very excited about the football championships, and we\u2019re very happy for whichever Nike team wins. Operator : The next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann of Goldman Sachs. Lindsay Drucker Mann : It seems as if every other global consumer products company is complaining about a very challenging macro dynamic. Outside of the currency issues that you guys highlighted, are there any markets where you\u2019re starting to see the second derivative turn a little bit softer, where you feel a little bit more cautious about or some disconnect between sell in and sell through? Or is your performance really as good as it seems? Don Blair : When you say second derivatives, you mean just overall consumer trends? Lindsay Drucker Mann : Yeah. Mark Parker : Well, one of the things I\u2019d say, just as an opening, is generally what we\u2019ve found is our product and our brand are really the keys to how successful we are in a lot of these markets. And as long as we don\u2019t see huge moves in the macroeconomics, we believe that we can continue to generate growth in the business. And we\u2019ve generally seen that to be the case around the world. There are a few places where we\u2019ve seen some of the macros start to, at least in the near term, affect consumer confidence. Brazil\u2019s an example of that. Certainly we think over time we\u2019ve got to keep a close eye on Russia. But generally, what we\u2019ve found is our product is one of those things that consumers find ways to continue to buy and as long as we keep the brand hot and the product right and the distribution premium, I think we\u2019ll do fine. Trevor Edwards : And maybe just to jump in there too, I would say that we also believe that with the category offense, it provides us an ability to continue to bring innovation on multiple dimensions all the time. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in many of the marketplaces. So we have been able to somewhat, so to speak, buck the trend. Having said that, Brazil is clearly one of the markets that we\u2019re continuing to work on, to make sure that we stay ahead of that curve, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re working to accelerate the marketplace and make sure that we continue to implement our category offense more aggressively in that market. Lindsay Drucker Mann : And you\u2019ve talked about a strategy to take sort of ongoing inflationary price increases to offset what you had believed was sort of input cost inflation for an extended horizon. Has the move in commodity markets changed your view on pricing going forward? Don Blair : Well, let me wind back to the first part of that question. We actually are not pricing literally with either inflation or input cost. One of the changes that we made over the last five years or so is really focusing on the consumer as we set price. And really, it\u2019s about the value equation that we\u2019re trying to create with the consumer. And so when we bring innovation and brand strength and premium presentation at retail to the consumer, then you can move the consumer to premium prices. So we will obviously keep a very close eye on the consumer value equation. We are managing our entire P&L, including margins and costs and revenue and so on, and so yes, it\u2019s part of the calculus, but the pricing is really focused on maintaining the right consumer value equation in the marketplace. Operator : The next question is from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Jim Duffy : Trevor, a question for you. Visiting a number of the stores recently, the premiumization of the apparel is very evident. It also appears that the apparel collection is more tightly edited than in the past. Is that accurate? And can you also comment on the impact that you\u2019ve seen on apparel conversion in your direct to consumer, with the directional change? Trevor Edwards : Yeah, I think you\u2019re very astute, because absolutely that is what is taking place. I think on multiple dimensions. For instance, if you break into our apparel business and you break it out by segment, certainly you go by the women\u2019s business. Our apparel business is doing very, very well. We\u2019ve tightened the collections down. We\u2019ve made sure that they actually work across the line. So we\u2019ve seen really good strong conversions. Our apparel business within our own doors does exceptionally well. Our sportswear business, or the example of the Tech Pack, which we think is a great item and collection, actually, that\u2019s working across the business. So we\u2019re seeing strong conversion across. And one of the things that we\u2019re learning, which I think Mark has always talked about this, which is by being a better retailer, we actually are better with our wholesale partners. So we\u2019re taking that same knowledge of tightening the assortment and making sure that we apply that in the broader marketplace. And so we think that\u2019s actually what\u2019s driving the great growth that we\u2019re seeing. Mark Parker : You know, I will say, we\u2019re known for our footwear innovation. We\u2019re actually accelerating our commitment to innovation in apparel, and that\u2019s really where we\u2019re going to shine, I think, is to continue to really stand out from a performance premium apparel position, and then leverage that across what we talk about as our complete offense. And we\u2019ve done that, and where we\u2019ve really gotten a lead on that, we\u2019ve seen the consumer response has been actually quite positive. So as an innovation geek, product geek, I\u2019m incredibly excited about applying that even more aggressively to the apparel side of our business. Operator : The next question is from Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley. Jay Sole : There were some interesting comments in the beginning when you were talking about how you see a big apparel opportunity, how you\u2019re investing in the Nike women\u2019s business and you\u2019re seeing incredible momentum there. At the end of last year, the men\u2019s business was almost three times as big as the women\u2019s business. So if we think about it from a big picture perspective, what\u2019s the opportunity to close that gap over time, given the momentum you\u2019re seeing, given the investments you\u2019re making? And can you talk about maybe some structural reasons why the gap can\u2019t be the same eventually? Mark Parker : Well, the opportunity I spoke to a little bit in my remarks, we\u2019re seeing a big shift in women\u2019s, just in terms of their participation in sports and being more physical. We\u2019re seeing that online with the number of women we have participating in our Nike Plus and our training applications online. So the relationship we have with the women and the trend that we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s not really a trend, as I call it. It\u2019s more of a cultural shift. So the appetite is there for more active product, and we\u2019re seeing that in both footwear and apparel. So the opportunity to really start to close that gap is tremendous. And we think that over the years ahead, we\u2019ll start to reduce that differentiation between men\u2019s as a percentage of Nike\u2019s business versus women\u2019s. So very, very bullish on the women\u2019s opportunity and the response to the work that we\u2019ve already done in elevating that part of our product and our communication. Trevor Edwards : Yeah, and I think as Mark just touched on, it really speaks to why we think the women\u2019s is such a big and huge opportunity for us, and why we\u2019re very focused on it. We believe we are absolutely on target to go after our $7 billion goal for fiscal year 2017, but we truly believe it\u2019s not about that, it\u2019s actually about beyond, continuing to really move the needle around our women\u2019s business. Operator : The next question is from Michael Binetti with UBS. Michael Binetti : Just quickly on the China business, it\u2019s interesting because you guys used to give a fairly detailed report card, as you started to really go into the active mode of repairing that business. Maybe we can look at just where we are in that business now as far as you were controlling inventories for a long time, working with the retailers to improve the presentation at retail and put some capex into those stores. And I guess numerically, it\u2019s very interesting to see 20% revenue growth off of 6% futures, and now that you\u2019ve accelerated the futures to 13, how do we think about that spread going forward without getting to carried away with what we can look at? It certainly doesn\u2019t point me intuitively to a midteens revenue growth for the year. So just any help there would be great. Mark Parker : I think first of all, you\u2019re right, in the previous quarters we were giving you a pretty detailed articulation, and one of the things we said that was because of the prior year comparisons, the futures growth rate and the revenue growth rates were not going to look all that obvious or all that intuitive, so that\u2019s why we gave much more specific guidance on that market than we normally do. And once again, this quarter we gave revenue guidance of mid-teens growth for the year, because it is a little hard to read the futures and the revenue growth, just because of the prior year. Once we get past this fiscal year, we\u2019re going to start to be anniversarying numbers that are a little more consistent, and we can go back to fairly normal relationships between futures and revenue. But for right now, what we would ask that you do is pay attention to what it is we give you as future guidance. That is our best estimate of where we think the revenue numbers would be. You\u2019re still going to see some unusual relationships between futures and revenue for a few more quarters. Michael Binetti : And if I could just ask one more question on the gross margins, obviously the nuances of the gross margin we\u2019ve talked about a bit on this call, but as we\u2019ve visited over the last few years, the topic always comes up of when you guys can get back to the prior peak gross margins of just over 46%. And we\u2019ve heard you talk a lot about premiumization, and clearly you\u2019ve worked very hard on that line in the P&L. Do you think at this point that the work you guys have done on product and on manufacturing and on the focus on pricing, we\u2019ve reset the bar long term for the grosses to be able to go over that level longer term? Mark Parker : We don\u2019t necessarily see there as being a ceiling on gross margin. As I said earlier in response to the pricing question, this is really about creating the equity in the brand and the product and how we distribute it that enables us to be premium and get paid for our work. And we believe that we have opportunities in terms of the revenue portion of the equation as we continue to drive that value equation behind the innovation and the brand. On the cost side, we\u2019ve talked about some of the things we\u2019re doing in the manufacturing space. We\u2019ve talked about just getting better and better at how we flow product, and we continue to see opportunities there. So we don\u2019t see that previous peak as somehow a magical ceiling. As I said in my earlier remarks, it\u2019s a signpost on the journey, but we believe that we can continue to create that value in the margin equation. Operator : And the final question is from Eric Tracy with Janney Capital Markets. Eric Tracy : I guess if I could touch on digital, and ecom, obviously a couple of quarters now of pretty significant acceleration. Maybe just touch on the consumer migration, the evolution of that channel overall. Obviously a massive opportunity, but how do you think about sort of expanding the market versus cannibalizing it and how you kind of maintain the relationships and balance with your wholesale partners? Mark Parker : Good question. First of all, I\u2019d say that our commitment to DTC, our direct to consumer business, is a huge and critical part of the commitment we have to create a more premium presentation for our brands and our products and ultimately, giving our customers, consumers, a better experience all around. So with that said, the world is changing. Consumer behavior and expectations are certainly changing. More people, it\u2019s no mystery to anybody here, are shopping online. They want products easy, they want it fast, they want to be able to customize and personalize, shop on their devices, and in an in-store setting. So the relationship between those channels is really critical, whether it\u2019s Nike direct or with our retail partners. And that\u2019s really the focus of our marketplace development work is to really obsess how all the parts or channels actually work together, and work together in a way that really gives the consumer the best experience. So we\u2019re focused on how do we address the needs and expectation of the consumer as we say they ultimately decide. So Nike, I think you\u2019ve seen, along with our retail partners, is expanding the market, and we\u2019re seeing more positive results all around. We think this is a win-win situation between Nike and our wholesale partners around the world, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing. Trevor mentioned, and we\u2019ve said this quite regularly, being a better retailer is making us a better company and a better wholesale partner. Nike.com, as bullish as we are, and as positive as the results have been, which are pretty spectacular, is still in the early stages. We\u2019re investing heavily. This is one of the bigger growth opportunities for us long term, big improvements in just how the consumer interacts with Nike online. Seamless cart experiences, making the transactions a lot easier. Actually, blurring the lines between transactioning online and in store. Supply chain improvements, improvements in ID. I could go on. Increased focus on mobile, very, very important for us. So the investment and the focus on this area will continue. And not as a separate, isolated part of Nike, but as an integrated part of our business and our categories. So I\u2019ll just say we\u2019re obviously quite bullish on this, and this is where the consumer\u2019s going, and this is where we\u2019ll be. Kelley Hall : All right, well, with that, we want to thank everyone for joining us. Happy holidays, everybody, and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter.",

Before I turn the call over to Mr. Sharan, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K. Some forward-looking statements concern future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total revenues for subsequent periods due to mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns, which may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.\u2019s continuing operations including equipment; Converse, Hurley, and NIKE Golf are not included in these futures numbers.  Following the conference call, the futures order schedule will be posted through financial schedules on the NIKE Investor Relations website. Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales and constant dollar revenue. References to wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results.  Similarly, references to constant dollar revenue are intended to provide context as to the performance of the business eliminating foreign exchange fluctuations. Participants may also make references to other non-public financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures. To the extent non-public financial and statistical information is discussed, presentations of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations will be available at NIKE\u2019s website, investors.NIKE.com. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Nitesh Sharan, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Nitesh Sharan : Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE, Inc.\u2019s fiscal 2017 third quarter results.

So, we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event, you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker. Mark Parker : Thanks, Nitesh and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid third quarter, delivering revenue growth of 5% for NIKE, Inc. to $8.4 billion. On a currency, neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 7%. Gross margin declined 140 basis points to 44.5%. Earnings per share increased 24% to $0.68, and we delivered ROIC of 33%. Q3 saw NIKE sustain our positive momentum. Let\u2019s start with highlights from an amazing quarter for our athletes. Serena won her 23rd Grand Slam, Roger took the Australian open against Rafael to extend their great rivalry; and both NIKE and Jordan continued to dominate basketball\u2019s biggest movements. At the NBA, All-Star was 20 of the 25 players on the roster, and in March madness with 12 of the teams advancing to the Sweet 16. This quarter, we also raised the voice of our athletes with the equality campaign, showing yet again that NIKE stands up for our believes, our message spreads far and can be a catalyst for true positive change. With wide spread energy behind the athletic industry right now, NIKE is aggressively competing in every market, and we are creating our own opportunities using our combined power and scale. Last quarter, I talked about our relationships with consumers, and how we're getting sharper and moving faster to serve them. That sense of focus has only accelerated over the last 90 days. The consumer has decided digital isn\u2019t a just part of the shopping experience. Digital is the foundation of it. This and other factors have shifted consumer patterns, especially in North America, impacting traffic, the economics of brick-and-mortar retail and is driving a more promotional environment in the near term. While we are mindful of these near-term dynamics, we remain focused on the long term. The current backdrop represents a tremendous opportunity for NIKE, because the brands that win are going to be the ones that have been out in front with digital and leading with service. While we don\u2019t expect this transition to be simple, we are clear about what it will take to get there. We're aligning all of our firepower against the consumer experience. To see consumers rising expectations, we're driving fundamental change in three core areas of our business, through the innovation that inspires them, the supply chain that delivers it quickly and in the marketplace, where we connect personally, with consumers. And while we continue to see great success against all three areas, we committed to doubling our impact in each of them. We call it our triple double. So what do I mean by that? In products, we're doubling our cadence and scale of innovation through performance and sports style. Throughout our supply chain, we are doubling our speed, from product insight to delivery to the consumer, and in the marketplace, we're doubling our direct connections with consumers through digital membership and personalization. To win now and create the future, we're obsessing these three areas, 2X innovation, 2X speed and 2X direct. I'll give you some detail on each. Let's start by going deeper on 2X innovation, where we're shifting to even faster innovation cycle and scaling more effectively. Our consumers will feel the impact of this immediately. For example, in just a few days we're launching our highest performance and most visually striking Air Max Cushioning System ever. We'll continue to push the edges of style with Air Wafer Max and quickly scale it into new models. And to kick off the sub-two-hour marathon break in two project, we've developed a disruptive design with the NIKE Zoom X Midsole. The Zoom X providers' runners with an incredibly comfortable ride and energy return like we've never seen before. With running footwear, we're always looking to improve efficiency. That's why we're so excited about the new NIKE Zoom Vapor Fly 4%. As a former marathoner, I know that even a 1% gain would be an impressive accomplishment. But over our previous best shoe, this delivers an astronomical 4% gain in efficiency. It's no surprise that feedback from our lead athletes has been off the charts. We can't wait for more runners to give it a try when we release the NIKE Zoom Vapor Fly 4% in early June. Later this summer, we'll unveil a third Platform, a next generation cushioning system designed in radical new forms that help runners and baseball runners increase their performance and stay fresher longer. Using a new material, this will be the first widely available NIKE platform that merges our new algorithm based approach to designing with data. Combined, this new system with Vapor Max and Zoom X, and that's three new cushioning platforms coming to market in the months ahead. As our consumers, will soon see, this is truly a cushioning revolution from NIKE.  In apparel, NIKE and the NBA will bring fans closer to court side next fall. We're delivering innovation that extends way beyond the court, covering every stage of the players' journey. That's a huge untapped commercial opportunity, and our strategy will be to blend sport with everyday lifestyles for both the athlete and the fan. All of this innovation, gives NIKE a critical edge in the near term, but we know a loaded innovation pipeline is what ignites our next phase of growth over the long-term and there's plenty ahead. Looking toward the future, we're in the later stages of evolving and scaling personalized performance beyond the HyperAdapt 1.0, with more comprehensive fit systems, including continued advancements in our FlyEase technology, a new level and look of Flyknit that's so strong it can withstand the forces of the NBA's most powerful players, and merging performance and style in another new cushioning platform that actually conforms and shapes to the foot for ultimate comfort. With all of these products to hit the market over the coming months, it\u2019s clear NIKE is driving a faster innovation cycle and bringing it to more people than ever before. Our second area of focus is to create a more agile and opportunistic organization or 2X speed inside and out. We continue to stay one step ahead of the consumer. We will cut our average product creation cycle in half. One way we\u2019re doing that now is through our express lane, where our global product teams and our product engines make real time adjustments to DTC and wholesale product lines with local teams in North America, Western Europe and China. We\u2019re moving faster than ever before, getting products to market in weeks not months. Through the express lane, we're fueling consumer demand through new localized styles. We're supercharging our most successful franchisees. For example, we build more flexibility and speed into the delivery of some of our top sellers like the Air Pegasus, the Air Force ,1 and we\u2019re looking ahead to include the Air VaporMax as examples. Another key to moving our teams closer to market is the work we\u2019re doing within our manufacturing revolution. With partners like Flex, we\u2019re expanding into more styles with advanced automation in the build and adhesion processes, localizing sourcing for quicker material lead time and reducing waste through advanced knitting and higher precision cutting technologies. We\u2019re seeing a positive impact to gross margins in the tens of millions and we expect that to continue to accelerate. These are not separate initiatives. We're linings up the pipes of our manufacturing revolution, with real time consumer insights, seamless inventory and a hyper local marketplace approach, all of which is connecting the dots in the name of speed for the consumer. To make room for this speed, we\u2019re driving focus through our Edit-to-Amplify approach. This is an area where we have not been as sharp as we need to be. Currently 75% of our styles generate 99% of sales. By editing out 25% and amplifying the productivity of both new innovations and the products consumers already love, we\u2019re driving more growth and choice from fewer styles, and we\u2019re already seeing positive near-term returns from our work here. Edit-to-Amplify is a mindset that reaches well beyond product. It\u2019s about prioritizing every step along the way, from the category to GO's to cities, to accounts, all the way down to the door level. Our final area of focus is 2X direct. This strategy doubles the business that is in direct service of the consumer, and we do this by leveraging this digital and membership to bring the NIKE brand closer to them, regardless of whether they are in our own DTC or with wholesale partners. We want to extend NIKE\u2019s homeport advantage across all channels. We are seeing the opportunity up close. Take NIKE Soho for example, which some of you have visited. When consumer walks through that door, they get one to one personal shopping service, invitations to our running and training clubs with other members, the opportunity to trial our latest innovations, and seamless access to product to get them what they want quickly. And what we found is that NIKE plus members who use our personnel shopping appointments generate more than three times the average transaction size. We see the consumer shift within digital commerce as well, with a larger share of our growth coming through our apps. Its further confirmation that the consumer responds to a simpler, faster and more personal connection. And right now that level of service, that deeper experience with the NIKE brand is driving growth in our own DTC. Moving forward, we will expand that opportunity by rolling out these successes with our own wholesale partners around the world. The more directly NIKE engages with the consumer, the greater the return. We've seen it with our strategic partners in key accounts, such as footlocker, Dicks, JD, Intrasports and TMall, where we've grown our businesses together, despite the uneven environment. And for those partners who align with our more direct approach to the consumer, we have an opportunity to leverage the Express Lane even more. And we know there still more work to be done here. More personnel, more mobile, more distinctive, these are the dimensions that will drive growth. And I\u2019m convinced now is the time to rewrite the playbook of retail. When I look out to the next year, we have a lot be excited about. Now it\u2019s more important than ever for NIKE to say true to our own values and leverage our competitive advantages. There will always be room to improve, but I\u2019m proud of the way we're managing our business today and I\u2019m bullish on our opportunity to extend our leadership position for tomorrow. Our triple double strategy is setting the stage for this next phase of growth at NIKE, to win now, and to create the future. Thanks, and now here is Trevor. Trevor Edwards : Thank you, Mark. Hello, everyone. In Q3, the NIKE brand delivered another solid quarter of growth. As always, my remarks are on a constant currency basis. NIKE brand revenue grew 7%, led by continued double-digit growth in Western Europe, Greater China, and our emerging markets' geographies. NIKE brand DTC revenue increased 13%, driven by 18% growth in digital commerce, new store expansion and 6% comp store growth. Today NIKE is in a familiar place on the offence. Mark said, we are doubling our direct connections with consumers, an approach that will be seen at retail as we ramp up how we serve our consumers through digital commerce and membership. And as always, we work to create brand energy across performance and lifestyle, connecting consumers to the products they want and love, and we bring it all to life through our geographies, a global portfolio that provides NIKE unrivaled agility and scale. Now, let\u2019s get into a bit more detail on these three areas. Our deep relationships with consumers drives us. We built the NIKE brand by serving consumers. It is our central promise. And as we grow in scale and reach, we continue to serve our athletes personally. Mark spoke about the power of personalized service and seamless commerce in North America, particularly in our Soho and Miami stores. Let me just add that we\u2019re seeing the same success around the world as well. In January, we opened a NIKE and Jordan store in Beijing, our largest basketball-focused store in China. There, a NIKE+ Basketball Trial experience and t-shirt customization offers seamless links between NIKE\u2019s physical and digital platforms. As we roll out more experiences like these, consumers see that retail is more than a series of transactions. We believe it should be personal and full of energy. For us, personal service is the new premium. To that point, our NIKE+ and SNKRS apps are successfully serving consumers more individually. Despite still only being offered in North America, they are driving more growth, better consumer engagement and higher conversion rates. With our investments in cloud technology, we are accelerating the global expansion of our apps, to become even faster and more nimble in serving the consumer\u2019s changing needs. All of these experiences offer powerful examples of the services that will enable us to double our direct connection to consumers, both in our owned and partnered retail. At the same time, we are relentless in our goal to design products that deliver both innovation and style. Running and Basketball, two of our most important categories, sit at this intersection. In Q3, Running saw continued success, especially in our international markets, as the Air Zoom Pegasus showed strong sell-through. Also, as we celebrate the month leading up to Air Max Day, we\u2019ve unveiled several styles that are drawing strong consumer demand, including the first Air Max 90 Flyknit, the Air Max 1 OG in its 30th-year anniversary, and the Air Max Jewell, a sophisticated new silhouette designed for women. And of course, the launch of the Air VaporMax this weekend will be a significant moment for the NIKE Brand. We debuted a laceless version of this performance shoe in Paris and drove energy throughout the fashion world. After all, the quest for perfect performance influences style, and vice versa. And the shoe, simply constructed of two of our greatest inventions, Air and Flyknit, fulfills our dream of walking on nothing but Air. We will continue to build consumer excitement for the Air VaporMax, by bringing new creative versions and global scale to serve this incredible energy we are seeing. We have high expectations for the Air VaporMax, and I'm very excited about the launch. In Basketball, we're seeing great energy, from the game, to our athletes, to our products. Let\u2019s start with this : the Kyrie 3 launched in December, is the top-selling performance basketball shoe in the marketplace. The LeBron 14 is showing very strong early results, and at the same time the LeBron Soldier 10 remains one of the hottest styles in the category. Also in Q3, the launch of the Paul George 1 saw very strong consumer response. And we continue to drive the demand for basketball with iconic and popular products like the Air Force 1. Modern looks on this beloved silhouette also sold very well in Q3. That includes the Special Field Air Force 1 and the high-energy collaborations with creative brands like Vlone and Acronym, proving yet again Nike\u2019s ability to adapt our most popular styles to serve new audiences. So, Nike Basketball, fueled by the KD9, the LeBron Soldier 10 and the Kyrie 3, is seeing double-digit market share gains in the $100 to $150 price zone. And with the energy around the PG1, we expect this will only accelerate. And the future remains bright, with a new era of retros kicking off with the first-ever re-release of the LeBron Air Zoom Generation. We believe LeBron, like Kobe and Michael before him, will translate his singular greatness to a long line of product, and with the successful launch of his first retro, consumers clearly agree. Speaking of Michael, the Jordan Brand continues to lead in elevating performance and sports-style together. We see Jordan\u2019s energy on the court in MVP-type seasons from Russell Westbrook and Kawhi Leonard, and we\u2019re seeing it off the court with several strong sellers in Q3, including the Jordan OVO and our Black History Month collections. The top performer, however, was the Space Jam 11s. And when I say top performer, I don\u2019t just mean in Q3. The Space Jam 11 was the largest and most successful shoe launch in the history of Nike. This speaks not only to the obvious demand for our products, but also our ability to connect greater numbers of consumers worldwide to the products they covet. At the same time, the Jordan Brand continues its expansion beyond basketball, this time with the University of North Carolina\u2019s football team, and increasingly into the Women\u2019s business with the NikeCourt Flare AJ1.  While we're talking about product, I'd be remiss if I didn\u2019t highlight the success we're seeing in Apparel, whether that\u2019s our Zonal Strength Tights, our popular Plus Sizing line, or Tech Fleece, which continues to sell very well, particularly the Advance Fleece line. Throughout our categories, we are competing on all fronts, attacking opportunities with the cumulative advantages that NIKE has built. Finally, our global diversification provides unrivaled agility and scale to sustain growth over the long-term. From North America to Western Europe to Greater China, we are running a powerful global offense, where we continue to develop deep relationships and bring excitement to consumers all over the world. In North America, our brand continues to be incredibly strong. We see it when our most coveted products sell out rapidly on the SNKRS app, when members show up rain or shine at our NIKE Run Clubs, or when we see consumers enjoying premium executions in our stores, and in our partner doors like Foot Locker\u2019s House of Hoops, the Fly Zone and the Fieldhouse at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods. And we continue to tap into powerful sport and cultural moments. In Q3, just a few days apart, we delivered at New York Fashion Week and at the NBA All-Star Weekend. Nike and Jordan celebrated Fashion Week with special product drops and targeted retail executions, and then followed it up with special player editions for our deep roster of All-Stars. Our ability to leverage both these events speaks to the distinction of our brand. Now, while we\u2019re seeing consumer traffic patterns shift by digital disruption, retail consolidation, and increasingly promotional environments, this geography continues to move in the right direction. In Q3, revenue was up 3%, gross margins expanded and inventory declined 8%. And we continue to see that the right product, the right experience and the right brand strategy generates tremendous consumer demand. That said, while we remain focused on strengthening our leadership position, we know we have more work to do to supercharge performance product in North America, particularly in Running. When we see a new market or competitive dynamics within a category, we move quickly to identify the consumer opportunities, and we focus our resources against them. We\u2019ve proven that this is the right strategy time and again. For example, last year we were losing share in Basketball in North America, and now we\u2019re taking it back. We\u2019re on the offense and we anticipate accelerating growth in performance, in large part fueled by the Air VaporMax\u2019s energy and the upcoming Cushioning Revolution that Mark mentioned. Around the rest of the world, our brand and business are seeing great momentum. In Western Europe and Greater China, a continued shift to more a active lifestyle is fueling growth. Specifically, in Q3 Western Europe had its 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, and Greater China saw its 11th straight quarter of double-digit growth. In Western Europe, we saw growth across nearly all categories, across all territories and across DTC and wholesale, led by Digital. We also reclaimed Western Europe\u2019s #1 position in football footwear, as Nike players dominate the top leagues, scoring more goals than any other brand this season. The market continues to grow at a healthy pace. In Footwear, we saw growth in Running and Sportswear, and in Apparel, we saw broad-based growth led by Sportswear and Global Football. Now, in China, the opportunity is massive. Just over the past five years, the number of marathons there has grown 500%, and China\u2019s government predicts a sports economy valued at $850 billion by 2025, by far the world\u2019s biggest. Our leading brand position in China gives us confidence we will continue to see real growth from this expanded market.  Indeed, Nike and China have a long history together, and we continue to connect with this growing sports culture. In January, in addition to the Beijing store, the Jordan Brand opened two new Jordan-only stores in Chengdu and Taipei, celebrating the Brand\u2019s 20th anniversary in China. And partners like Topsports and Pousheng are helping drive strong sales by scaling elevated experiences across key cities. In Q3 we also partnered with tennis star Li Na to introduce a signature line with Women\u2019s Training and Sportswear styles, our first exclusive line for a female Chinese athlete. And additionally, we are looking forward to China hosting the FIBA World Cup of Basketball in 2019, and with our recently announced partnership with FIBA, we can\u2019t wait to work together to grow the sport of basketball internationally. In the end, the Nike Brand is built to win. We connect consumers with the product and experiences they want, across performance and lifestyle; we strategically balance across a diverse global marketplace; and we lead the pack with groundbreaking retail executions, both in premium brick-and-mortar and pioneering digital commerce. As always, we are on the offence and it's these core strategies that will fuel and extend our leadership position over the long-term. Thanks. Now here\u2019s Andy. Andy Campion : Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and hello to everyone on the call. We are pleased with the results that we delivered in Q3, and, at the same time, we are not satisfied. We are pleased, because we continue to strengthen the fundamental drivers of NIKE\u2019s long-term revenue growth and earnings potential. Our financial strategy has three pillars; delivering strong revenue growth; expanding profitability, and generating high returns on invested capital. In Q3, we delivered revenue growth in line with the guidance that we communicated 90-days ago. We drove strong double-digit currency-neutral growth in aggregate across our international markets, which now represent more than half of our global portfolio, and we re-positioned NIKE for sustainable, profitable growth in North America long-term. We also expanded profitability, well in excess of our guidance, with EPS growing 24%. Finally, we delivered return on invested capital of over 33%, and at the high end of our targeted range, by continuing to edit within our core spending, to amplify more focused strategic investment in areas such as product innovation, digital commerce and membership, while also more tightly managing inventory. Over the past several years, NIKE has become even more fit for growth. On a currency neutral basis, we have built a more efficient and profitable business model. We have sustained momentum in the drivers of full-price gross margin expansion. We have systematically reduced SG&A as a percent of revenue. And we have significantly expanded our currency neutral EBIT return on sales. But, we are not satisfied. We are clear-eyed with respect to the challenges we have faced and opportunities we have not fully capitalized upon in the short-term. We have and we will continue to attack those opportunities with urgency. We are also obsessing over the triple-double that Mark referenced : doubling the cadence and impact of innovation, doubling our speed to market, and doubling NIKE\u2019s direct connection to consumers in the marketplace. That is the formula we are employing to fuel NIKE\u2019s next horizon of accelerating growth. As for innovation, we have more than doubled our investment in innovation of late, and you will now see us double the flow and impact of innovation we bring to market, immediately beginning in Q4. We also see tremendous growth potential in doubling our direct connection to consumers. NIKE\u2019s Direct to Consumer business continues to grow much faster than the broader market, and NIKE-branded concepts operated with our strategic partners continue to grow faster than undifferentiated multi-brand stores. In short, NIKE always wins when we create a home field advantage, that brings together a curated assortment of our products, a NIKE-branded environment, and direct, personal service of the consumers. To be clear, this opportunity is not simply about branded space. It goes well beyond. We see the opportunity to leverage NIKE digital membership to elevate personal service broadly across the marketplace. And, today, NIKE digital members already spend nearly two times what other NIKE consumers spend per transaction. Identifying, and then aggressively seizing upon these compelling growth opportunities is what we mean when we say NIKE is on the offense, always. But, before I speak to our go-forward outlook in more detail, let\u2019s take a few moments to reflect on the results that we delivered in Q3. In Q3, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 5%. On a currency neutral basis, revenue grew 7%, led by continued double-digit growth in Greater China, Western Europe and the emerging markets. Third quarter diluted EPS of $0.68 increased 24% versus the prior year, driven by revenue growth, SG&A leverage, higher other income, a lower tax rate, and a lower average share count. Gross margin contracted 140 basis points in the quarter. Full-priced average selling prices continued to expand. However, margin contracted overall, due to higher product costs, FX headwinds, and off-price sales. Demand creation decreased 7% to $750 million for the quarter, as our fiscal year spending was front-loaded, due to significant investment around the Olympics and European Football Championships. Operating overhead decreased 1%, as our continued strategic investments are being funded by productivity gains within our core operational spending. The effective tax rate for Q3 was 13.8%, compared to 16.3% for the same period last year, primarily due to a reduction in tax reserves and an increase in the mix of earnings from operations outside of the U.S., which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. As of February 28th, inventories were up 7%, driven by a higher average cost, due primarily to product mix and to support growth of our DTC businesses. Wholesale inventory units were down 3%. Next, let\u2019s turn to a few of our key operating segments. North America revenue grew 3% on both a reported and constant-currency basis, as we continued to see balanced growth across both footwear and apparel, highlighted by another quarter of strong growth in NIKE Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. EBIT growth of 9% outpaced revenue growth as gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage delivered increased profitability. As Trevor detailed, we continue to make great progress in North America, rebalancing supply and demand, reigniting momentum in our Basketball business, and sustaining momentum in Sportswear. That said, the North America retail landscape is not in a steady-state. Digital disruption and other dynamics are resulting in more aggressive promotional activity than we expected 90-days ago. So we are going to remain tight, with respect to the supply that we are putting into the North America market in the short-term, while aggressively driving the initiatives that will reshape and grow the market, and extend NIKE\u2019s leadership long-term. Now, turning to our international markets, where we continue to have very strong momentum. First, in Western Europe, revenue increased 10% on a currency neutral basis, as we delivered another quarter of strong multi-dimensional growth led by our Sportswear, Running and Global Football categories. On a reported basis, revenue increased 4%, while EBIT declined 13%, reflecting the impact of transactional FX headwinds and higher product costs on gross margin, partially offset by SG&A leverage. In our emerging markets, revenue grew 13% on a currency neutral basis, led by our Sportswear and Running categories. We also saw double-digit growth across most territories. On a reported basis, revenue increased 8%, while EBIT decreased 4% as results continue to be heavily impacted by FX. Last, but certainly not least, Greater China delivered another quarter of extraordinary results with currency neutral revenue growing 15%. We continue to see strong momentum across the business, with double-digit growth in wholesale and DTC, footwear and apparel, and nearly all categories. China as a nation is accelerating towards sport, both in terms of participation and passion, and urbanization continues at full-speed. With over 350 million Chinese millennials, one of the largest and most important demographics in the world, we believe we\u2019ve just scratched the surface of our growth potential in this important market. On a reported basis, revenue grew 9% and EBIT expanded 6% due to strong revenue growth and SG&A leverage. As evidenced in Q3, we extended our longstanding track record of managing all of the levers within our global portfolio to deliver strong results in the near-term, even amidst volatility. As we look ahead, we will also continue investing and innovating to exceed consumer expectations and fuel long-term sustainable, profitable, capital efficient growth. As for our specific guidance, in Q4, we expect reported revenue to grow in the mid-single-digit range, slightly below our Q3 reported rate of growth. On a currency neutral basis, we expect growth in the high single-digit range. We continue to see very strong growth in our international geographies, ranging from Greater China to Europe to emerging markets. In North America, we have made great progress over the course of this fiscal year, solidifying the fundamental drivers of growth. We are by far the leading and largest brand in North America with a $15 billion growing portfolio. Based upon the breadth and depth of our portfolio, we anticipate that the currently dynamic overall retail marketplace will create both puts and takes in the short-term. So we are being appropriately measured with respect to our Q4 financial targets for North America. We will keep supply tight, maintaining the strong foundation we\u2019ve created, while we bring new innovation to market and accelerate more direct consumer connections. Shifting to gross margin, 90-days ago, we anticipated less Q4 gross margin contraction versus prior year than we have seen year-to-date. While we were anticipating greater FX headwinds in Q4, we were also expecting to partially offset that with significant expansion in our operational, or currency neutral gross margin versus prior year. Today, we expect the same FX impact that we anticipated 90-days ago. However, based upon the currently more promotional environment in the overall North America marketplace, we do not believe it is prudent to target as much short-term expansion in our operational gross margin. Instead, we are going to maintain the financial flexibility to ensure that we continue to optimize sell-through. Accordingly, we are now targeting 150 to 175 basis points of gross margin contraction in Q4 versus prior year, with the year-over-year variance largely driven by FX. As for Q4 SG&A, we expect it to be roughly flat versus the prior year, as we continue to systematically drive productivity gains through our Edit-to-Amplify initiative. Other income, net of interest expense is expected to be approximately $15 million in Q4; and, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 22%. Note that NIKE Brand futures orders are down 4% on a reported basis versus prior year, and down 1% on a currency-neutral basis. As previously discussed, futures are an important part of our operating model, but futures growth is no longer a reliable proxy for revenue growth based upon several factors we\u2019ve previously articulated. Illustrating this point, you will see that China futures are growing low single-digits based on changes we have made to our monthly shipment flow globally. However, we continue to project strong double-digit revenue growth in China. We are in the early stages of our planning for fiscal year 2018, and will provide financial guidance on our next earnings call. Today, I'll share some preliminary thoughts. We are employing a balanced, three-pronged approach to our planning for fiscal year 2018. First, we will remain appropriately measured. Second, we will be sharply focused, attacking the most compelling growth opportunities in the marketplace with speed and agility. And, third, we will be on the offense, executing the triple-double that will fuel NIKE\u2019s next horizon of accelerating long-term growth. Financially, we are targeting continued revenue growth across all geographies in fiscal year 2018, led by strong growth internationally. We also project significant operating leverage and expanding profitability, which on a currency neutral basis would result in earnings growth consistent with our long-term financial model. That said, at our investor day in October fiscal year 2016, we communicated that we expected FX to be a significant headwind through fiscal year 2018, as our long-dated hedge portfolio matures and rolls forward. And since that time, the U.S. dollar has further strengthened against most international currencies. At current rates, we project that we will have absorbed $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion of cumulative FX downside over fiscal year 2016, fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018, with the most significant annual impact being in fiscal year 2018. We look forward to putting these extreme FX headwinds behind us, as we exit fiscal year 2018. In the meantime, we will continue to deliver strong revenue growth, and make NIKE a much more efficient and profitable enterprise on a currency neutral basis. In closing, we will continue to manage all of the operating levers within our portfolio to deliver strong performance in the short-term. At the same time, we will remain relentlessly on the offense, investing, innovating and, in some cases, revolutionizing the industry to exceed consumer expectations, fuel long-term growth and create value for shareholders. With that, we\u2019ll now open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim. Bob Drbul : I guess, if you can spend a few minutes on basketball, in terms of what you delivered this quarter and the expectation going forward as a driver. And then just, if you could spend a little bit more time elaborating on China in terms of the futures versus the revenue outlook, and what exactly changed with some of the shipments timings that you\u2019ve talked about? Mark Parker : Okay. Bob, I\u2019ll take the first one. So on basketball, we continue to see the basketball business strengthen. And there is no doubt that we\u2019re obviously the leader of basketball, and there is incredible energy with our athletes. We see a really strong pipeline of products and we have the ability to continue to grow the game around the world. When we think of basketball, we always think about it as a portfolio NIKE basketball, NIKE Sportswear and the Jordan Brand. What we've seen is great momentum really across all those dimensions. First on the sportswear side, just to give you a one dimension, the Air Force 1 franchise is doing exceptionally well in the marketplace, and we\u2019re seeing new stuff, like this special field Air Force 1 really become an icon and continue to grow. The Air Jordan Space Jam 11 which I mentioned earlier broke launch records. Then you have the you have the Kyrie 3, which is now the top selling performance basketball shoe in the marketplace. When you speak about performance, then you go specifically into the KD9, the LeBron Soldier to handed the Kyrie 3, are all driving double-digit market share gains in the $100 and $150 price zone. And then we\u2019ve added the Paul George and then the LeBron 14. So all-in-all, we have really brought, a really strong focus around basketball. We are clearly focused. We\u2019re on the offense, and we are incredibly excited about the products that we have come in in addition to the NBA partnership that we have on the horizon. So all-in-all, basketball really is just starting to go from strength-to-strength. Andy Campion : And Bob, I\u2019ll take the China question. The short answer is, the China futures in a low-single-digit range reflects purely timing impacts. As we continue to optimize our management of supply and demand and inventory, one of the opportunities we\u2019ve identified is with the respect to the flow across the three months that comprise a season. And so we\u2019ve made some changes that help us better identify opportunities and capitalize on being in stock in the marketplace. It also has a benefit to us from an inventory management and capital management perspective. We see continued strong double-digit growth in China. In no way do the futures reflect any change in our very bullish view with respect to the tremendous performance that we\u2019ve had, and we continue to expect in China. Nitesh Sharan : Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question please. Operator : The next question is from Kate McShane from Citi. Kate McShane : Thank you. My question \u2013 my first question was on the cushioning platforms. I know we typically see these innovations around the Olympics. I was curious about why they\u2019re coming out now instead, and how quickly do you expect to scale these? Andy Campion : Yes, well, these cushioning systems, all three of them, and in fact there\u2019s four. If you listen carefully, there\u2019s a fourth comfort cushioning system in the works. These have been in development for the past two or three, in some cases, four or five years. This is part of our double the investment in R&D, and we\u2019re really seeing that investment paying off. One of the most important outputs of performance innovation for NIKE is in the area of cushioning. So we see \u2013 some of this work actually led up to Rio. The top three finishers in the marathon were all wearing the Zoom X technology, and also in the Olympic trials leading up to the Olympics. So you\u2019ve seeing bits and pieces of some of this but not out in the market at scale. So we\u2019re basically ready to launch the product, excited about every one of the cushioning systems. They not only create a new level of performance and incredible breakthroughs in the case of the Zoom X, but they also create a whole new aesthetic, which is translatable not only into performance product, but also to the street. So the leveragability and the scalability of these technologies is tremendous. The challenge we have frankly is to make sure that we\u2019re \u2013 the focus is on these and we scale these in a way that we can really tell the stories independently. But together, they form what is truly \u2013 and I mentioned it, a cushioning revolution for NIKE and the industry. As a product geek, I am incredibly excited about what\u2019s coming in the next six months. Kate McShane : Okay. Great. And then if I could follow up with your commentary on the North American dynamic, are we really talking about what\u2019s happening in the department store channel? I\u2019m just curious what negative trends continue to persist here when we\u2019re starting to approach the lapping of some of the bankruptcies, and just what\u2019s driving the level of promotion that you\u2019re seeing? Mark Parker : Yes, well, let me just start at a little broader level. The retail landscape is particularly in the U.S. is not \u2013 is in a steady state. I think that\u2019s obvious, undergoing some significant shifts. And those shifts really create some big opportunities and some challenges at the same time. I think the important thing to point out is that these changes are really being driven by the consumer, and consumer demand at the same time remains quite strong. But we know that consumer expectations are quite high in terms of product, the type of product they want, the innovation, the style. They want the product fast, they want it easy, they want personal service. So these are all things that are driving some of these shifts in the marketplace. And that's why we're focused on doubling the output or the cadence of innovation or speed to market so we can be that much more responsive to consumer needs, deliver innovation more quickly, and then doubling our direct connection, to consumers in the marketplace, using or leveraging the power of digital. So again, it's a market that's undergoing a lot of shift and change, but again, I wouldn't trade you our position with anybody. I think we're in a strong position to leverage our strength as a brand, as a Company and we expect to do that. Nitesh Sharan : Operator, we'll take the next question please? Operator : The next question is from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : Thank you, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to first ask about the Triple Double initiative, especially the speed and pace to market innovation frequency. Maybe help us put this in context, and help us understand the impetus behind this. From an external perspective, it seems to a lot of people in the market that the kind of steeper market shifted in the last couple of years, maybe a little bit away from some of the performance, styles and looks and products that have been the market and maybe a little more towards that street and fashion element. Do these initiatives help you kind of directly address that, and what's the timeframe I think for getting the inventory balance right, along what the market is looking for as you implement some of those initiatives? Or is that not the right way to think about it? Mark Parker : Well yes. The reason we're putting so much emphasis on this Triple Double strategy is it's going to get us closer to the consumer, and put us in a better position to serve the consumer with the innovation that we're creating, do a better job of editing that product selection and really calling out the key stories. The good news on a macro level is that the consumer appetite for active and sport based products is I think at an all-time high around the world. It's just sort of part of the fabric of everyday active lifestyle. And so the demand for the product is definitely there. People want more, they want product that obviously performs at a high level, but also looks incredible. It's not an either/or. It's an and proposition. And then want that product fast and they want it easy, at easy access to the product. So our whole initiative is about getting that direct connection strengthened to the consumer and making sure we're in the best position to keep that cadence of innovation moving out to the market as quickly as we can. It also puts us in a position to be more responsive. When we see product that's hot, we can turn that product around a lot quicker and get it to the retailers and to our own -- for our own DTC, to the consumer a lot quicker. So overall, it's just making us more competitive and more responsive to where the consumers are at. The Express Lane, let me just touch on that, because you asked about speed specifically. There's really three different components of the Express Lane. Fulfill is one, and that means getting product more quickly, restocking product more quickly based on what consumers want, and that's real-time, and that's through sell-through based insights. Another dimension is what we called update, and that meaning editing materials or colors on popular or existing styles for models based on consumer feedback or insight that we gather. And then the third dimension of it is create, and this is basically creating new products from scratch and bringing them to market with much greater speed. Again, that\u2019s in half the time that we\u2019ve done it traditionally. So that whole end-to-end process is basically being cut in half today from six months down to roughly three months or less. And I think that\u2019s again, it\u2019s going to put us in a much more competitive position. Andy Campion : Mark. I\u2019ll just add couple of other things. I would just say that what we see from the marketplace is consumers want both great performance, and they want style, and they want those two things together. And I think a great example of that is the product that we\u2019re actually just launching, which is the Air VaporMax, which you\u2019ll see that there are actually different variations to that product; one which is a very clear high performance product, the running shoe and we\u2019ve also got a laceless version, which actually appeals to more of a style perspective. But the shoe in and of itself is both great performance and it\u2019s also superiorly stylish. And so that is what we believe the consumer wants. So when we bring new platforms, you will see us bring more variations, that gives the consumers more choice on the thing that they actually love all the time. Go ahead. Omar Saad : Sorry, I appreciate that. I appreciate those answers. I also wanted to ask a question about SG&A, if it\u2019s okay. It's been down kind of in dollar terms the last couple of quarters. You guys obviously have had a track record of really over investing to fuel long-term growth. Should we be thinking about the SG&A line differently? Is there something about this era that we're in, where maybe this requires the same spend levels or is that really just lapping kind of the year-over-year Olympics and other activities? Andy Campion : It\u2019s a great question Omar. To be clear our top priority is investing to fuel long-term growth. So that\u2019s where the dialogue with respect to SG&A or capital expenditure starts at NIKE. But we\u2019ve identified is in over time, our growth has allowed us to invest appropriately, and in some cases in a very ample, maybe even a little more than we necessarily needed to. And I would think about this way. We have existing and new truly differentiating capabilities or competitive advantages in NIKE. Those include things like product innovation, design, digital, brand marketing, including sports marketing and our supply chain, especially the elements of the supply chain that Mark spoke too, the ones that we're looking to get greater speed out of, in service to the consumer. That\u2019s where our focus is on investment. The other functions that we have within the Company are certainly important, but they\u2019re not differentiate capabilities for NIKE and we look at those other functions as functions where we can optimize our spending, not just for purposes of saving expense, but it actually makes us more streamlined and nimble as an organization. So in some cases, our editing is aligned with shifting business priorities, or with existing business priorities, and in other cases our editing is really a form of zero basing in areas where we believe, we have the opportunity. And that\u2019s what I would call from the financial perspective, my version of Mark's Edit-to-Amplify initiative from a product and business perspective. And we believe that we continue to have opportunity in this regard. Again, if you exclude FX, we've made ourselves much more efficient and profitable over the last couple of years. And we still see opportunity ahead in that regard. Nitesh Sharan : Operator. We\u2019ll take the next question please. Operator : The next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs. Lindsay Drucker Mann. Lindsay Drucker Mann : I wanted to ask on North America, and maybe a follow-up to Shane\u2019s question. I think a couple of quarters ago, you had talked about the need to de-stock and cleanup the channel, and that as we sort move through that, you had expected revenue in U.S. to accelerate. I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re \u2013 given the commentary on the U.S., specifically on your fourth quarter, how you\u2019re thinking about the timeline to U.S. sales acceleration? Andy Campion : Hi, Lindsay. It\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll start on that one. The first part of your question was about what we\u2019ve been talking about over the last several quarters, and we have made great progress in that regard. You obviously saw revenue growth and margin expansion in the quarter with inventories declining. That is pretty squarely in the zone of effective and efficient supply and demand management. So we have re-solidified our foundation in that regard. As Trevor and I think Mark to some extent touched upon, we\u2019ve also solidified the fundamental drivers of growth in North America. Trevor talked about all of the work we\u2019ve done to reignite momentum in Basketball. We have continued momentum in Sportswear. So what we\u2019re referring to when we talk about being measured in the short term in Q4 is the recognition and reality that it\u2019s a promotional marketplace, particularly in North America is, in light of some of the digital disruption that\u2019s going on. I think Kate earlier referred to there, select channels that are more challenged than others. What we\u2019re most excited about is there are dimensions of the market that are tremendous opportunities. And so as we move into fiscal year 2018, what we\u2019re really focused on is creating a springboard for accelerated growth in North America, again, through the triple double. And in the marketplace, obviously, one of those -- the three doubles is doubling our direct connection to consumers through DTC and our wholesale strategic partners. Lindsay Drucker Mann : Got it. So to the degree that the environment is disruptive, how do you think about your ability to achieve the long-term revenue growth algorithm in North America that you laid out in your Investor Day? Does the market dynamic make that harder to do? Andy Campion : Frankly, we\u2019re probably more bullish than ever on the long-term growth projection in North America. And why I say that is it\u2019s becoming even more crystal clear to us that the strategies we\u2019ve been employing to elevate the experience, the personal service of consumers in the market, digital, we\u2019ve been leading the NIKE.com but also membership, we\u2019re seeing much stronger growth in the dimensions of the market where NIKE is connecting with consumers. Of course, we connect with consumers in our Direct-to-Consumer business. We do it through concepts like House of Hoops, with Foot Locker. And as we said, in each of those dimensions, and when you get down to purely digital membership, we\u2019re just seeing the growth outpace or the sales per transaction outpace. And so we see our way to incredibly strong growth in North America long term. There will be puts and takes in the short term. Clearly with innovation and disruption, comes both puts and takes. I think by analogy, you might look to greater China. Greater China is a market with extraordinary growth, by really focusing on aligning product, a NIKE-branded environment, both owned and through partners and digital to fuel sustainable sustained growth. Trevor Edwards : And one other things too I\u2019d just say, that the brand is extremely strong in North America and consumer\u2019s appetite for our brand continues to really be almost unsatisfied. So what we continue to is make sure that we line up the right products in the right environment, and as Andy spoke about, especially when we can do that more direct, and we can connect with the consumers more personally, we find that that continues to really allow us to continue to expand the market and expand our position in the marketplace. So we do feel very confident about North America in the long-term, and we certainly feel that the brand is very strong. Nitesh Sharan : Thank you, Lindsay. Operator, we'll take our last question please. Operator : The last question is from Jim Duffy from Stifel. Jim Duffy : Thank you. Andy follow up for you. Your FX kind a [indiscernible] around those hedge contracts have, but we said the most significant impact in fiscal 2018. Can you elaborate on that please? Maybe help us make sure how much of the $1.6 billion to $2 billion you've referenced will have been absorbed by year end fiscal '17? Andy Campion : Sure. So as you probably know Jim, and for others, we can't eliminate the impact of foreign exchange. And as you know, over two years ago, we saw significant strengthening of the dollar pretty dramatically and quickly against a lot of international currencies, particularly the euro. And we've seen a lot of volatility over the last couple of years. But largely dollar strengthening. Our hedging strategy is largely using longer dated. So 12 to 24 months out forward hedging to mitigate and delay that impact. So when I spoke to the $1.6 billion to $2 billion of impact over two years, on a rate basis you see those moves happened in the foreign currency impacts immediately. Our hedging strategy essentially steps us down or frankly in the opposite would steps us out, but steps us down to that impact. The largest single annual impact will be in fiscal year 2018. That said, it hasn't been insignificant in fiscal year 2016 or 2017, it is actually -- the FX impact has been a double-digit negative headwind on EPS growth. So while we continue to deliver strong EPS growth, what we're actually most proud of is that excluding foreign currency, that would be double-digit higher in terms of our growth. So that hopefully gives you a little bit more dimension, but we're not providing a specific forecast as to the impact of FX on fiscal year 2018 today. Jim Duffy : Fair enough. Considering the headwinds you are facing from FX, are there other areas in the P&L that you hope to use to mitigate that as you look out to fiscal '18? Andy Campion : Absolutely. And we have certainly done that over fiscal year 2016 and 2017. First and foremost is growth. We are obviously a growth company and in fact with attacking compelling growth opportunities in the market. Long-term obviously is our focus but in the short term as well. I'd say from a margin perspective, the underlying drivers of gross margin expansion are very strong and we see those being very strong in fiscal year 2018 versus fiscal year 2017, again on a currency neutral basis. I mentioned that we continue to see opportunity to become even more fit for growth from an SG&A perspective through Editing to Amplify. And what I would say is most importantly for us in the short term is how we're executing against our long-term strategy. And that's what we\u2019re going to be most focused on as we finalize our plans for 2018 and as we move through 2018, as executing against Triple Double that Mark referenced. Nitesh Sharan : Thank you, Jim. Okay, I think that\u2019s all the time we have for today. Thank you, guys, for joining us. We\u2019ll speak with you soon. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker. Mark Parker : Thanks, Nitesh and hello, and good afternoon, everyone. Serving athletes in today\u2019s quickly evolving marketplace demands a new approach. It means rethinking the fundamentals with an action plan that focuses on speed and deeper connections with consumers. In fiscal 2017, we managed our business through this dynamic environment, while at the same time we initiated big changes to set the stage for our future. It was a year for making aggressive moves. All with a goal of igniting the next phase of accelerated growth for NIKE. So let\u2019s take a look at the numbers for the year. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 6% to $34.4 billion on a reported basis. On a currency neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 8%. Gross margin declined 160 basis points to 44.6%. Earnings per share rose 16% to $2.51 and we delivered ROIC of nearly 35%. As I reflect on the year and what the consumer is telling us, three insights stand out. First, the consumer appetite for newness and choice has never been higher. Their connected world means unlimited access to new products. So when they see something they love, they want more versions of it from performance innovation to style. For example, this year the introduction of the Air VaporMax energized the whole Air platform. Five of our top 10 sportswear styles featured Air Max cushioning, adding fuel to a NIKE Air business that already represents several billion dollars. Second, consumers are choosing brands who lead with elevated service and new experiences. They want brands that are engaged and make a personal connection. Our opportunity is to create more compelling experiences in NIKE environments and with our best partners. Third, consumers want the latest products faster. This year we continue to build more agility and speed into our organization. We\u2019re becoming better editors through high impact initiatives like EDIT to AMPLIFY, and we\u2019re driving scale and efficiencies. Innovation is how NIKE sets trends and new capabilities like the Express Lane are how we adapt to them. All told, these are the forces helping to shape our triple double strategy and our recently announced Consumer Direct Offense. We\u2019ve aligned product, design, categories in key cities all the way to the consumer. Supported by our strong brand, we are executing with precision and focus. Under this new formation, we\u2019re in the best position to drive growth against the biggest opportunities. And we\u2019re clear about what those opportunities are, to double innovation, speed and direct connections with consumers. So let\u2019s start with 2X innovation. It\u2019s about taking the consumer somewhere new and expanding our opportunities for growth. For example, we all know how critical cushioning is to an athlete\u2019s performance and that -- and the different athletes have different preferences. So this summer we\u2019re offering a range of experiences through a cushioning revolution. That\u2019s three new platforms that push the edges of performance. The first is the Air VaporMax, a product that hits the sweet spot of performance and style. As I\u2019ve always said, NIKE\u2019s competitive advantage is that our innovation creates new expressions of style. Equally, the consumer expects lifestyle product to look good and feel good with no compromise. VaporMax has been very successful out of the gate with strong sell through across multiple releases. And looking ahead, will add even more breadth to the VaporMax family of products, scaling into millions of pairs through fiscal \u201818 to meet the growing demand. Another platform, ZoomX, played a key role in an own inspiring moment this past May. I was there at the finish line at Monza, Italy, when [ph] Iliade Cantogi (7:43) finished with an extraordinary 2 hour 25 second marathon time. It was a thrilling moment for sports and an incredible validator for one of the most amazing breakthroughs I\u2019ve seen in performance footwear. During the NBA playoffs, another new platform, NIKE React made its debut in both the [ph] NIKE HyperDon (08:07) 2017 and the Jordan SuperFly 5. NIKE React is the first high performance pump system that offers a major leap forward in three key benefits, lightweight, ultra-responsiveness and durability in one single platform. With all three platforms, we\u2019re just getting started. NIKE\u2019s strength is our ability to get more out of each of our innovations by scaling across brands and across sports and what you\u2019re seeing right now is just a snapshot. We have a relentless flow of exceptional products and platforms on the way. We\u2019re preparing for major launches with the first Flyknit apparel starting with the Flyknit bra, a radically designed comfort cushioning platform and HyperAdapt 2.0 delivering new forms of adaptive technology at more accessible price points, plus we have never before seen technology in NBA Apparel along the way. New sustainable innovation brought to scale through some of our most iconic footwear styles and new additions to the Air Max family that leverage our new capabilities in Air sole manufacturing. Up and down our categories, we think the consumer is going to be excited about what we have in store in fiscal \u201818 and of course, as always, we\u2019ll have few more surprises along the way. Turning to 2X Speed, the Consumer Direct Offense will intensify our focus on 12 key cities in 10 countries. Currently, these markets represent over 80% to NIKE\u2019s projected growth through 2020. The cities and countries are now supported by a simplified structure of four geographies, North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Greater China, and Asia Pacific and Latin America. The key city strategy will create two big changes, it will add greater digital expertise and control in the markets, where consumer connections happen and they will be the source for real-time sensing of the market to influence product creation, primarily through our Express Lane teams. The Express Lane serves three functions, the first is to fulfill and that means more quickly restocking what consumers want based on real-time sell-through data. The second is update and that\u2019s editing and refreshing materials, colors, or prints on popular existing models based on consumers\u2019 insights. And the third is create and that\u2019s creating new products and moving from design to shelf in half the time. The Express Lane is already up and running in North America and Western Europe, and this summer a new Express Lane will be activated in Asia. As part of our key city approach, we\u2019re cutting critical weeks out of the delivery time in the world\u2019s most promising markets for sport. And through manufacturing partners like Flex, we\u2019re also moving at a faster pace than ever before. Flex has already produced approximately 1 million pairs of footwear across multiple styles and together in fiscal \u201818 we\u2019re piloting more responsive business models to deliver product to market faster. We\u2019re ramping up speed at scale. One of the areas where I expect to see the most dramatic change quickly is in 2X Direct. We\u2019ve now aligned our teams in DTC and digital to bring the consumer closer to the products, services and experiences that only NIKE can provide and leading with mobile, we\u2019re unifying and simplifying access for the consumer. Our digital products just passed an important milestone in fiscal \u201817. NIKE.com and our apps now total more than $2 billion in revenue and that\u2019s nearly double in just the last two years. In fiscal \u201818, both SNKRS and NIKE+ are expanding into Europe and Greater China. With the opening of our new digital studios, we activated a new vision for the future of sneaker culture and commerce, tapping into uniquely creative outlet within our key cities. There\u2019s some very exciting work here, especially in app-base experiences and commerce. Trevor will highlight some of the examples of how these are coming to life. In Retail, we know the opportunity for innovation isn\u2019t ours alone. Innovation in Retail is everybody\u2019s opportunity. With Nordstrom, a destination for women, we\u2019re combining digital and physical experiences with the dedicated NIKE and Nordstrom page on Nordstrom\u2019s app. Over the past five years with Zalando in Europe, we\u2019ve had great success growing our business to an elevated presentation and service and in China, we have a premium experience on the world\u2019s largest platform, TMall, where NIKE is the biggest sports brand reaching an incredible 500 million users. In the U.S., we\u2019re executing a new pilot with Amazon with a limited NIKE product assortment. As we do with all of our partners, we\u2019re looking for ways to improve the NIKE consumer experience on Amazon by elevating the way the brand is presented and increasing the quality of product storytelling. We\u2019re in the early stages but we really look forward to evaluating the results of the pilot. Whether it\u2019s through our own channels, printing press concepts with long time partners or exploring new commerce partners, NIKE\u2019s defining what\u2019s possible at Retail to better serve consumers and unlock growth. We\u2019re making big shifts in the year ahead to our business and within our teams. We\u2019re taking the qualities that differentiate NIKE and making them even stronger. We have a brand that inspires globally, a thriving culture of innovation, a deep lineup of amazing products, the world\u2019s greatest roster of athletes and a consumer obsessed model. These moves are about taking action to accelerate growth and we have a clear plan and a competitive talented leadership team to get us there. Thanks and now here\u2019s Trevor. Trevor Edwards : Thank you, Mark. In Q4 and throughout fiscal year \u201817, the NIKE Brand delivered strong growth, demonstrating again the power of our uniquely diverse global portfolio. As always, my comments are on a constant currency basis. NIKE Brand revenue grew 7% for the quarter and 8% for the year with double-digit growth internationally in all quarters this fiscal year. NIKE Brand DTC revenue was up 12% for the quarter. For the year, DTC revenue was up 18% driven by online growth of 30%, new stores and comp store growth of 7%. The NIKE brand is strong with an unmatched ability to inspire consumers across the globe. And while we are seeing healthy growth across many dimensions of our business, we know ample opportunity remains. With our new Consumer Direct Offense, we are more focused than ever on amplifying those areas where we have momentum and accelerating those where we have opportunity. We\u2019re doing this by bringing the NIKE Brand closer to consumers, moving faster and serving them more completely. Mark discussed how our new offense is moving decision-making closer to our consumers, so that we may move at their pace, if not a step ahead. Let me briefly share the work we\u2019re doing in the marketplace and how we expect it to drive even greater growth. We have a uniquely powerful connection with our consumers. They want to be a part of our brands. They want a relationship and that means we think of membership differently. It\u2019s providing distinctive access and improving the ways we serve them. With these deep connections, it\u2019s no surprise that time and again our consumers choose us. The results prove this vision with members on our apps spending nearly triple what others spend on NIKE.com. Through Consumer Direct, we are elevating our concept of membership to take full advantage of this commercial opportunity. We connect consumers to the product they want through exclusive offerings and tailored recommendations. For us, membership is an accelerator, a catalyst that drives growth. In Q4, nearly three quarters of our NIKE.com consumers were members, up 25% and growing, with plan to accelerate through stronger member benefits and international expansion. We know there are member benefits that only NIKE can provide. For example, we leverage the breadth and depth of our most coveted products to bring physical and digital retail together. With our mobile apps, we\u2019re disrupting the sneaker shopping experience. This quarter with sneakers stash, we unlocked access to exclusive products using geolocation and with Shock Drop we offered unannounced releases that surprised the sneaker community. The sneaker app was only available in North America and is now expand into Europe, Greater China and Japan. This work is strengthened by our key cities strategy as we move our digital teams into cities to offer distinct experiences and connections. One exciting example is a new interactive experience through sneakers in New York that makes certain styles exclusively available to members who unlock them through the app\u2019s new augmented reality features. We have also begun a new partnership with Instagram that will allow consumers to purchase NIKE product seamlessly in the Instagram app. Clearly, we are boosting our ability to create new ways to serve consumers, making the entire NIKE+ ecosystem available to consumers where they already live. This is why we are so excited about the Consumer Direct Offense. It will take these elements and all these great concepts and scale them to make the most of our connections with consumers everywhere. These kinds of meaningful connections are always elevated during major sports moments. From Breaking2 to the NBA Final showdown between LeBron and KD, these incredible sports moments fueled momentum across running, basketball and other key categories in Q4. Starting with NIKE Sportswear, which draws inspiration directly from performance categories like running and basketball, we had another strong quarter of strong double-digit growth with sportswear -- the sportswear -- NIKE Sportswear stands as nearly $8.6 billion business as we shape the look of sports for our industry. In particular, we are seeing strong momentum in many iconic styles with the -- from the Cortez to the Presto, and the success of the Air VaporMax, a high-performance running shoe is energizing the entire NIKE Air platform. As always, we are very excited about the innovations in the pipeline that will continue to bring performance to sports style. And with the reintroduction of the popular style guide on NIKE.com, we continue to elevate the experience for our consumers driving strong sell-through in products like our Beautiful Power collection in Women\u2019s. In fact, all told, our Women\u2019s business led by sportswear is showing tremendous growth having outpaced Men\u2019s over the full year. In Running, fiscal year 2017 was headlined by the balanced success in performance and lifestyle that Mark mentioned. For the year, we saw 8% growth with very strong momentum across our international markets. In Performance, we were proud to sweep the podium at the Boston Marathon with five of the six runners wearing our new ZoomX technology. We know people are drawn to extraordinary performances and we worked throughout Q4 to use our brand to bring this energy to scale. This, of course, leads to the nascent success we had with Breaking2, where performance innovation ignited global excitement like only NIKE can, 20 million people watched the live stream on Twitter and Facebook as the world tuned in. Those are viewership numbers that rival the biggest events in sports. That attention created global awareness for the Zoom Vaporfly 4%, driving momentum across the entire Zoom platform, including the new Zoom Fly and the Pegasus 34. In Basketball, the momentum we have been seeing accelerated as we returned to growth in Q4. Our return to growth in NIKE Basketball shows the energy we are driving is real and lasting. What\u2019s more, as we look at the industry as a whole, we know that as NIKE Basketball -- as goes NIKE Basketball, so goes the entire basketball market. The signs of NIKE\u2019s basketball progress are clear. Our strength in footwear came in large part due to Kyrie 3 remaining the number-one performance basketball shoe and the Paul George 1 becoming the hottest shoe in the market with incredible sell-through. Successes like these drove significant market share gains in the all-important $100 to $150 price point. Though the overall category declined for the year, NIKE Basketball saw strong double-digit growth in Greater China and Western Europe. The innovations we launch create excitement and continue to drive energy for the culture of sport, which we bring to life through sportswear. This all adds up to incredible potential as we look to leverage our NBA partnership to drive our 2X Direct strategy. Yet we aren\u2019t waiting. The NBA Finals provided an opportunity to deeply engage with our consumers. During game one, we gave members first access to buy the KD 10, still KD Callaway, as soon as he stepped on the court. This is the kind of on-demand interactive digital commerce experience that you will see more of as our NBA partnership takes off. Jordan also continued its run of success with an outstanding year of 13% growth. Today the Jordan brand is a $3 billion business. This year outside of North America, Jordan grew in excess of 25%, showing incredible international potential for the brands signature style and sole. Also, the new AIR JORDAN 31 Lows along with the several other popular styles drove energy and demand at premium price points. All told, in Q4, we saw growth across all three dimensions of our complete basketball offense from NIKE Basketball to Jordan to Sportswear. Now turning to our geographies, the success we\u2019re internationally has us excited about with the Consumer Direct Offense will do. These are markets where we\u2019re leapfrogging over all the models of retail to drive accelerated growth and we are bringing these successes domestically as we recalibrate the landscape. In North America, momentum is building. In Q4, we saw another quarter of revenue growth driven by sportswear and Jordan, gross margin expansion, and improving inventory levels. For North America, we\u2019ve made great progress in the supply chain managing inventory this year and today it\u2019s clear we are well on the right path. At the same time, we still see a dynamic and promotional landscape. This is why we are aggressively executing our Consumer Direct Offense is so important. That said, we have tremendous anticipation for the products we will launch this year. Our partners that have seen the products are excited. Consumers are starting to talk. We have loaded the pipeline and we can\u2019t wait for everyone to see it. That pipeline and the excitement we know it will bring is why we feel so confident about our North America business. In Western Europe, we saw 12% growth for the quarter and 11% for the year as our market position strengthened. Throughout Europe, we\u2019re seeing apparel outpace footwear as our work driving the look of sport continues to fuel growth. Here\u2019s one example we are really proud of. NIKE Sportswear in May was the biggest month for any category in the history of our Western European business. In Q4, we saw significant strength in DTC and digital. Our largest accounts in Western Europe also showed strong growth highlighted by strong momentum with JD and Zalando. At the same time, we activated the Express Lane in Europe ensuring consumers are served with stronger, quicker response to the products they love. In the emerging markets we saw strong double-digit growth across channels and in nearly all territories. Overall revenue grew 14% for the full year and 18% in Q4. In March, we saw an amazing execution of Air Max Day throughout the emerging markets. A series of city activations with more than 75,000 participants sparked extraordinary sales with 100% sell-through of the Air Max 1 and the Air VaporMax styles. This is yet another example of how our city teams localize global stories and bring them to life for their consumers. Finally, in Greater China, the brand is stronger than ever. Mark mentioned we are the number one sports brand on TMall and with our digital commerce apps expanding here we are just beginning to tap into our full potential. For the full year, we saw 17% growth in -- with quarter four up 16% driven by double-digit growth across most dimensions of the business. In Q4, we launched White Hot, a powerful white sneaker collection. Fueled by influencers and athletes, White Hot was an incredible success as NIKE continued to leverage trend-right concepts to go deep with the styles that consumers want. Throughout NIKE.com, TMall and WeChat, we saw strong product sell-through and significant consumer engagement. Through work like this, we keep our momentum in Greater China moving full speed ahead and we plan further acceleration as we expand the Express Lane to this geography. In fiscal year 2017, we saw real successes in our greatest growth opportunities. We also know there are areas where we can get better and with the Consumer Direct Offense, I know we will. Thanks. Now here\u2019s Andy. Andy Campion : Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and hello, everyone, on the call. Reflecting on our financial performance in fiscal year \u201817, I\u2019d like to focus on three key themes that serve as important context going forward. First, the more closely we connect the NIKE brand to consumers in the marketplace, the stronger our growth. In fiscal year 2017, our DTC businesses grew 18% on a currency neutral basis, led by NIKE.com, and our NIKE branded experiences with partners also grew at a rate that\u2019s far outpaced less differentiated multi-brand wholesale distribution. Second, we continue to deliver strong growth internationally and we have even greater potential for growth ahead. International markets currently represent roughly 55% of our portfolio and grew at a double-digit rate in aggregate in fiscal year 2017. While NIKE is the leading brand in fast growing developing markets around the world including China, current per capita spend on NIKE in those markets is still less than one-tenth of the per capita spend on NIKE in more developed markets. Over time, macroeconomic drivers and consumers expanding passion for sport will create even greater capacity for the NIKE brand to grow in those markets. Third, we continue to demonstrate our ability to manage all of the operating levers within our portfolio to deliver sustainable, profitable growth under a wide range of circumstances. In fiscal year \u201817, we delivered 16% growth in earnings per share, despite significant geopolitical and FX headwinds, and a rapidly evolving competitive and promotional marketplace. These themes reinforce why we are so aggressively executing on and we are so excited about the potential long-term financial impacts of our new Consumer Direct Offense. First, take 2X innovation. Innovation fuels growth. We have doubled our investment in innovation over the past three years and we\u2019re now beginning to see the outsized returns that can be generated through incremental investment in innovation. As Mark and Trevor detailed, we broke through the barriers of human potential with the Breaking2 initiative and the ZoomX platform. We also launched the Air VaporMax platform in Q4. If there was a question as to consumers appetite for performance innovation or willingness to pay premium prices for products that exceed their expectations in terms of performance and style, our launches in Q4 answered those questions. Demand for the products we launched well exceeded our initial supply and over the course of fiscal year \u201818, we will be scaling these new innovation platforms across our global portfolio of categories and geographies. To be clear, from a financial perspective, incremental investment in innovation drives asymmetrical returns on the topline by favorably impacting both our pricing architecture and overall demand. Second, the benefits associated with doubling our speed favorably impact one, revenue growth through greater demand capture; two, gross margin expansion through a higher mix of full price sales; and three, inventory efficiency as our supply is even more closely tied to real-time consumer demand signals. While selling out of a style within hours is evidence that we have exceeded consumer expectations, selling out within hours also represents lost opportunity. By reducing our time-to-market, our Express Lane in North America, Western Europe and soon Asia are beginning to help us translate data driven demand signals into more timely, profitable and capital efficient revenue growth. Third, doubling our direct connection to consumers will drive an amplification of our topline growth. Consumers are showing us through traffic and spending patterns that they want experiences that offer the NIKE products they love in a NIKE branded environment with the level of service and experience that only NIKE can provide. Today the dimensions of our business that fall within our broad definition of Direct represent roughly 35% of our business on a wholesale equivalent basis, but drove 70% of our growth in fiscal year 2017. These dimensions are also more productive and profitable than other less differentiated consumer experiences. For example, fulfilling demand through NIKE.com generates nearly twice the revenue and significantly higher margin on each transaction and over time, we see the growth of digital as accretive to NIKE\u2019s bottomline profitability. So we will continue to prioritize and drive a more immediate shift towards more direct service of the consumer. We are confident that the continued execution of the Consumer Direct Offense will drive NIKE\u2019s next horizon of accelerated growth. Our confidence as evidenced by the recently announced changes within our leadership and organizational structure. Those changes were not about cost cutting, but rather part of our more deliberate shift in focus and investment towards fueling growth through this new offense. Now let me turn to a brief review of our Q4 and fiscal year \u201817 results. In Q4, we delivered growth in line with and profitability that exceeded the guidance we provided 90 days ago. Specifically, NIKE in Q4 revenue increased 5%, up 7% on a currency neutral basis. For the full year, NIKE Inc. revenue increased 6%, up 8% on a currency neutral basis. Fourth quarter diluted EPS increased 22% to $0.60. Full year diluted EPS grew 16% to $2.51 driven by revenue growth, SG&A leverage and a lower effective tax rate. Gross margin contracted 180 basis points in Q4 and 160 basis points for the full year. For the quarter, margin contraction was primarily driven by foreign exchange headwinds of approximately 140 basis points, as well as higher product input costs offsetting sustained increases in average selling prices. Fourth quarter demand creation decreased 10% as our fiscal year spending was front loaded due to significant investments around the Olympics and European Football Championship. For the full year, demand creation decreased 2%. Operating overhead decreased 1% for the quarter was flat for the full year as we continue editing to amplify, fueling our strategic investments through productivity gains within our core operational spending. The effective tax rate was 13.7% in Q4 and 13.2% for the full year. The full year rate was 550 basis points lower than last year\u2019s rate, primarily due to a one-time benefit in the first quarter of the fiscal year related to the resolution with the IRS of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreign earnings taxed in the U.S. As of May 31st, inventories were up just 4%, as growth in our DTC businesses and increases in average product cost per unit were partially offset by a 3% decline in NIKE Brand wholesale inventory units. Now let\u2019s turn to financial performance for a few of our key operating segments. For the full year, North America revenue grew 3% on both a reported and currency neutral basis led by strong growth in DTC. EBIT also increased 3%. For the quarter, North America revenue was up 1% on a currency neutral basis and flat to prior year on a reported basis. EBIT grew 5% in the quarter, primarily fueled by gross margin expansion. As we\u2019ve evidenced over the past several quarters, futures are no longer a reliable proxy for revenue growth and our strategic shifts are amplifying this. As such, we continue to see a high single-digit disparity between revenue growth and futures growth in North America. While the North America retail landscape remains promotional, we are executing with greater precision. We continue to tightly manage supply and demand and in turn, we delivered margin expansion in the second half and closed the year with inventories down 6%. In fiscal year 2018, we will more deliberately fuel growth in the direct dimensions of our business, while also more deliberately transforming or transitioning away from other less differentiated and less productive points of distribution. Accordingly, we are planning overall growth in North America for the full fiscal year, with slight contraction in the first part of the year as we aggressively drive the strategic shift. Our key measures of success in fiscal year \u201818 will include stronger growth in the more direct dimensions of our business, both owned and partnered, healthy expanding margins for the geography overall and continued efficiency in the management of supply and demand. Now turning to our international geographies. In Western Europe, fiscal year \u201817 currency neutral revenue was up 11% with strong multidimensional growth across DTC and wholesale, footwear and Apparel all territories and nearly every category. In Q4, revenue increased 12% on a currency neutral basis, led by our Sportswear and Running categories, as well as our Young Athletes business. On a reported basis, fiscal year \u201817 revenue increased 6% and EBIT declined 16% reflecting the impact of transactional FX headwinds on gross margin. Our emerging markets geography also delivered broad-based revenue growth. On a currency neutral basis, fiscal year \u201817 revenue grew 14%, led by our Sportswear and Running categories. We also saw double-digit revenue growth across DTC and wholesale, footwear in several territories. For Q4, currency neutral revenue was up 18%, with double-digit growth in most categories in nearly all territories. On a reported basis, fiscal year \u201817 revenue increased 8% and EBIT increased 9%, as strong revenue growth was offset permanently by transactional FX headwinds on gross margin. Last, but certainly not least, we continue to see extraordinary momentum in Greater China, as we delivered another record breaking year with over $4 billion in reported revenue and currency neutral revenue growth of 17%. We saw a strong growth across DTC and wholesale, footwear and Apparel in nearly all categories. Greater China is currently the geography where the NIKE brand is most directly serving the consumer in the marketplace, leveraging NIKE brand at digital and bricks-and-mortar experiences, both owned and partnered to exceed consumer expectations and fuel growth. For the quarter, currency neutral revenue grew 16%, with double-digit growth in both footwear and Apparel, DTC and wholesale in most categories. On a reported basis, fiscal year \u201817 revenue grew 12% and EBIT expanded 10% as strong revenue growth was slightly offset by lower gross margin, primarily due to transactional FX headwinds. Now moving to our outlook for fiscal year \u201818 and beyond, given the dynamic operating environment, the strategic shifts we are driving through the Consumer Direct Offense and significant foreign exchange headwinds, we are providing more detail on this call with respect to our financial expectations. I\u2019ll begin with our currency neutral expectations for fiscal year \u201818, which are an important lens into the underlying health and momentum in our business. For the full year, we expect to deliver currency-neutral revenue growth in the mid-to-high single-digit range. This includes growth across all geographies, led by continued strong growth internationally. We expect NIKE, Inc. gross margin, excluding the impact of foreign exchange to expand beyond the high-end of our stated long-term goal of 30 basis points to 50 basis points per year. For SG&A, we expect growth in the mid single-digit range. As a result, we expect to deliver another year of double-digit currency neutral EBIT expansion in fiscal year \u201818. On a reported basis at current rates we anticipate FX will be an approximately $700 million headwind in fiscal year \u201918. As the favorable hedges that mitigated and deferred the impact of adverse currency movements in each of fiscal year \u201816 and \u201817 mature and roll forward. As such, we expect fiscal year \u201818 reported revenue to grow in the mid-single digits. As for gross margin, we anticipate modest contraction by as much as 50 basis points, with FX having a more pronounced impact on the first half of the fiscal year. We expect SG&A to grow in the mid single-digit range, inclusive of costs related to our leadership and organizational realignment. We expect to incur the majority of those costs in the first half of the fiscal year, with savings being reinvested to fuel growth of our new offense. Other income and expense, net of interest expense, is expected to be an approximately $30 million to $50 million expense in fiscal year \u201818 and we expect our effective tax rate to be between 16% and 18% for the full year. Note that the impact of stock option exercises under the newly-adopted ASU 2016-09 may result in increased volatility in our quarterly effective tax rate. Shifting to the first quarter, it\u2019s important to note that year-over-year comparisons will be impacted by various factors, including the Olympics, European Football Championship, foreign exchange and our exit from the golf equipment business in the prior year. As such, we expect reported revenue to be flat, which on a normalized basis would be in line with our growth over the past two quarters. We expect gross margin to contract between 150 basis points and 180 basis points driven by FX headwinds. We expect SG&A to grow in the mid single-digit range and for other income net of interest expense, we expect to -- we expect a $10 million to $20 million expense in the first quarter. Looking out to fiscal year \u201819 and beyond, at current rates, we expect the negative impacts of foreign exchange to be behind us, positioning us to continue delivering strong growth and expanding profitability on a currency neutral operating basis, as well as on a reported basis. With that, we\u2019ll now open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Kate McShane from Citi. Corrina Van Der Ghinst : Hi. Thank you. Corrina Van Der Ghinst on for Kate McShane. Thanks for taking our questions. Maybe you could just start off with the -- more detail on the pilot that you guys are doing at Amazon. Do you guys have any color in terms of the timing of the launch, the segmentation focus that you guys are kind of aiming for in terms of price points, are they going to be more comparable to mid-tier premiums, are you guys going to do any -- are you planning on doing any exclusives and just in terms of the timing of why now? Mark Parker : Okay. Sure. Let me give you some perspective on how we\u2019re looking at our Amazon partnership. First of all, I would start by saying that our overall goal is to elevate the consumer experience by better segmenting and differentiating all of our channels. Just as a backdrop, that\u2019s foundational for NIKE. Every partner we have ultimately requires a specific approach and in other parts of the world, as I mentioned in my remarks, we\u2019re executing with e-commerce platforms like TMall and Zalando. We\u2019ve been doing that for over the past five years. With Amazon in the U.S., we\u2019re running a pilot that begins with a small product assortment across footwear, Apparel and accessories and what\u2019s most important to us is that we have the opportunity to elevate how the NIKE Brand is presented on the Amazon platform, and that includes the quality of the product information, and of course, providing a simple experience for the consumer. So we\u2019re really looking forward to seeing how this pilot combines, ultimately the convenience that Amazon is well known for with NIKE\u2019s brand and product power. Trevor Edwards : Yeah. And I\u2019ll just add a couple things around the merchandising strategy. I think one of the things that we have been able to do over many years is really just execute a merchandising strategy that really delivers against a wide range of consumers really across the marketplace. So we\u2019ve always been very thoughtful around how we segment and differentiate with our partners, ensuring that they have the right assortment that allows them to best serve the consumers with the right products and we will continue to do that certainly with this Amazon partnership. As Mark talked about, it is really a small pilot and it\u2019s just a start, and obviously, as we continue to work with them we will -- and we see success then we\u2019ll continue to think about how we scale it. Corrina Van Der Ghinst : Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just my second question, it looks like North American and European footwear both accelerated in the quarter, but Apparel decelerated on a sequential basis. Can you kind of walk us through what you\u2019re seeing in those categories and kind of your expectations for the next couple of quarters in terms of how those are progressing? And then if you could provide some commentary around the current U.S. wholesale environment by channel as you\u2019re seeing it? Mark Parker : Okay. Yeah. Certainly. Yeah. I want to touch on the Apparel piece first. I think, one of the things that you\u2019re looking at when you look at the Apparel. If you compare it against the prior year, you\u2019re making comparisons when we certainly had the corporate America. So we are seeing, it\u2019s just a tough comparison in Q4, and in North America we\u2019re certainly seeing that because we were doing also there was the promotional activity in the marketplace. Around Apparel, we continue to feel very bullish about our Apparel business. Obviously, as we go into the first quarter, we\u2019ve got the NBA partnership that we\u2019re launching and we\u2019re bringing some more innovative products. So we\u2019re trying to be excited and positive about our Apparel business. But not only in North America, but if you go around the world, we\u2019re seeing really, it go from strength to strength. So it really is just a great period. Trevor Edwards : Yeah. If I can just add a little bit of broader context too, it\u2019s obviously no mystery that the U.S. marketplace is undergoing quite a transformation. The consumer is leading a lot of that change and we see that really as a great opportunity. For us, it always starts with product. That\u2019s how the consumer ultimately casts their vote. And the good news, I think, from our perspective is that the product that we\u2019ve got in the pipeline as we mentioned is as strong as it\u2019s ever been across quite a spectrum. Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s, young, adult\u2019s, retro, modern, performance and Sportswear, so feeling good about our complete offense on the product side. But the important point is that product isn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s about better services and experiences and that\u2019s why we believe in this Consumer Direct Offense, I think, enabled by our Express Lane and then creating more disruption through digital. And then a lot of the great work we\u2019re doing to scale some of the app-based commerce that we\u2019re doing. So it\u2019s a very dynamic environment there, but we feel really good, we\u2019re doing what we need to operate a healthy business. Mark Parker : Thanks, Corrina. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question please. Operator : The next question is from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : Thanks for taking my question, guys. I was hoping you could maybe help us understand, how you\u2019re going to execute some of these really exciting Consumer Direct Offense strategies. The Express Lane, everything you\u2019ve got going on the NIKE+ membership side and given that so much of your business is still in that kind of tradition channel points-of-sale and the distribution used there, how do you -- can you integrate some of these new strategies with that wholesale backdrop or is it really something that\u2019s more refined and left to sit more predominantly in your DTC business? Mark Parker : Well, let me just start, Omar, with a little broader backdrop and these changes that we\u2019re making around our Consumer Direct Offense are really about accelerating our growth potential. We\u2019ve never really been about sustaining the status quo. It\u2019s not a winning proposition. This consumer led offense for us is about getting sharper. It\u2019s about getting more focused. And it\u2019s about, as we\u2019ve said, accelerating growth through the direct connections and then the elevated experiences in targeted channels and markets. So -- and as I\u2019ve mentioned, it\u2019s about innovation and storytelling, editing and focusing and we have a lot of opportunity there. We have to be better editors. I\u2019m really confident that we are. We\u2019re targeting some of the better innovation stories and doing a better job, I think of leveraging and scaling those across multiple categories and then we\u2019ve got to move faster and that\u2019s part of what this offense is all about. So we\u2019re looking at going half -- taking half of the time out of design to shelf to the consumer and that\u2019s a big step forward and we\u2019re looking and continuing to scale that over time. So there\u2019s growth if you look at it in all dimensions of our business and that includes channels as well. But as Andy mentioned, our focus is going to be pushing for the shift to direct where we have elevated experiences and that includes, as you mentioned, some of the app-based commerce that we\u2019re working on. Some of the biggest growth that we\u2019re seeing is in dotcom and some of the biggest growth on dotcom is really through mobile and the biggest growth on mobile is on app-based commerce, so incredibly exciting things happening there. So, overall, we\u2019re incredibly energized, excited for ourselves, but also bringing our strategic partners and the rest of the industry along. Trevor Edwards : Yeah. Mark, a couple of things I\u2019d just add to that, which is one of the things that we\u2019ve certainly seen in the landscape is the cities are really the center of the action where you\u2019re seeing really trends drive from the city. You\u2019re also seeing the acceleration of expectations in those cities. So one of the things that we did with our Consumer Direct Offense is we have a real complete offense in the key cities. What we mean by that specifically is before we had brand teams and maybe marketplace teams. Now we have complete teams from product to digital to creative teams to membership teams all based in the city and this is a big shift. And this is where they are able to really use the knowledge that they get around the trends in the marketplace to drive that connection with the Express Lane to create specific products to ensure that we could drive the business not only in that city but really across the market. So for us it\u2019s a very, very important piece. I think the other part that we did with the reorganization is we really put categories, design, products and merchandise all together as a full unit and their job is to ensure that we create the most innovative products and concepts that gets driven all the way through the market and then also we combined DTC with our digital organization. So now they\u2019re one unit and so we have a really a one way that the consumer wants to come through the journey of a direct connection with the brand, we\u2019re able to now serve them both physically and digitally. So we\u2019re super excited about this and it really does create an incredible opportunity for us to drive growth. Omar Saad : That\u2019s helpful. And then a quick follow up on the NIKE+ membership, sounds like that\u2019s really starting to accelerate. Can you give us some color what you\u2019re learning about how those NIKE+ members behave relative to just an ordinary customer and you also mention, I think, you\u2019re going to accelerate some of the features and benefits of that program? Trevor Edwards : Yeah. Thanks for that. I mean, we\u2019ve really seen just great, really great progress with NIKE+, both the sneakers app. What we\u2019ve certainly seen is that they triple that they -- spend three times as much members on the apps versus those who just come through as sort of an everyday consumer. So membership really has tremendous benefits for us and from a business perspective and we are driving that commercially. We will also be expanding that really across into Western Europe, as well as in China and Japan, because it has predominately been within North America and that\u2019s really just the start. I mean, we see a tremendous opportunity here and like I mentioned in the opening remarks, consumers expect more from us around membership and we have a lot more coming. So we couldn\u2019t be more excited as the months go ahead. So stay tuned. It\u2019s going to be fun. Mark Parker : Thanks, Omar. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next\u2026 Omar Saad : Thanks. Good luck. Mark Parker : Thanks. We will take the next question please, operator. Operator : The next question is from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim. Bob Drbul : Hi. Good evening. Mark Parker : Hi, Bob. Bob Drbul : I guess the first question that I have is around the three new platforms when you look at some of the bigger platforms and the more recent platforms prior to these, they ramped pretty quickly, I think, achieving a $1 billion faster and faster. Do you have any expectation on how quickly some of these can get to the scale you\u2019re talking about in the next few years? Andy Campion : Yeah. It\u2019s a great question, Bob. This is Andy. In the past you\u2019ve seen platforms ranging from Free to Lunar to Flyknit. Start with a bit of a ceding based approach as we assessed consumer demand and we took the exact same approach with the Air VaporMax and the ZoomX platform, which was part of the Breaking2 initiative, which is start with a healthy amount of supply, but get a read for consumer demand and as we said, those products sold out within hours in multiple color ways. And so we, much like some of the most compelling innovations we\u2019ve launched in the past, you\u2019ll see us ramping those up or scaling those pretty significantly and that\u2019s not just the same styles that we launch, but taking the actual innovation, the Air and the ZoomX cushioning system across price points and frankly across categories. Trevor Edwards : Yeah. I have to say, I love how the CFO jumps in on the product questions. Let me just quickly add that the focus on scaling and leveraging platforms is a big focus for us, and one of the things it\u2019s going to drive growth, and one of the things that this new organization, I think, is going to enable editing and focusing on those biggest opportunities to scale in the innovation arena is absolutely critical. Air VaporMax is an incredible opportunity, as we\u2019ve seen, not only in performance, but in style. It\u2019s bringing those two worlds together and obviously the consumers\u2019 responded very well there. A lot of excitement around ZoomX, as I talked about and where that can go. We\u2019re just seeing the very frontend. I\u2019ve talked about React. We\u2019re just starting to come to market with some React products and that\u2019s got massive potential, and there\u2019s frankly a couple of others that have huge scale potential that I did not mention and I probably won\u2019t go any further right now. But that we\u2019re really excited about. And then we have Flyknit, which getting outside of footwear for a minute and looking at Flyknit\u2019s potential to scale in Apparel is tremendous. Some real performance breakthroughs there that also combine innovation and style. I know I say this, but honestly, I\u2019ve never felt as energized by what we have from an innovation standpoint coming in the pipeline and that\u2019s why we\u2019re so confident. Bob Drbul : Got it. And then could I just ask like a couple of quick questions on the Amazon announcement? Is -- when you think about opening Amazon Direct, does that change your view on the NIKE 2020 targets of your DTC and your NIKE.com to $16 billion and $7 billion and is it a global pilot and will Jordan product be included in there? Trevor Edwards : It\u2019s -- like we said, right now, it\u2019s really a small pilot and we have a very tailored assortment for Amazon, so that we can actually learn as we go through this. In terms of looking forward, obviously, we have tremendous plans to continue to grow our NIKE.com business and what we talked is we\u2019re rolling out certainly the apps, not only around the world, but also accelerating the work that we\u2019re doing on that. So you can expect that to continue to grow at a very strong pace. So we\u2019re not giving any further guidance at this point in time, but we certainly feel confident about the growth that we\u2019re seeing and it\u2019s really is part of our Triple Double Strategy. And so the Amazon piece is just one element of how we serve the broader market by making sure that we are serving consumers wherever they choose to shop and making sure that that\u2019s through our doors, through our wholesale partners, as well as through platforms. So we\u2019re really looking to make sure we serve the consumer in the appropriate way. Mark Parker : And we expect the digital commerce platforms to be a bigger part of the picture going forward not just here in the U.S., but around the world. We\u2019ve mentioned Zalando and TMall, but that\u2019s going to be a bigger part of the picture for us. Bob Drbul : Great. Thanks very much. Good luck. Mark Parker : All right. Thanks, Bob. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please. Operator : The next question is from Jim Duffy from Stifel. Jim Duffy : Thank you. Hello, everyone. Mark Parker : Hi, Jim. Jim Duffy : Mark, my question is for you around efforts to compress a product timeline and speed time to market to improve responsiveness. What are the steps in the product development cycle that offer the most opportunity for time savings, is it more on the design and pre-production side or is it more related to manufacturing logistics? Mark Parker : Yeah. That\u2019s a good question. And really -- the answer really is there\u2019s opportunity in every segment of the product creation process through the supply chain, part of it is in better planning, part of it is in better editing of the product itself and also the product line in general. But everything from rapid prototyping on the very frontend, all the way through some of the modernization techniques in automation that we\u2019re pioneering with partners like Flex, HP, for example, are going to be critical factors there. But part of this is really staging, the innovation, tooling related, making sure that some of the more time intensive parts of the process or that\u2019s where we apply the innovation to cut those timelines down tremendously. And we\u2019ve already talked about the three different dimensions of Express Lane. I touched on update, fulfill and then create. And across those three dimensions, there\u2019s tremendous opportunity. Update and fulfill is more straightforward because that\u2019s existing product that we can rally behind quickly, and then create is all about accelerating the whole process from end to end. But again, I\u2019m really excited about some real step change innovation that the Express Lane work is going to enable and also our advance product creation center here in Beaverton with our key manufacturing innovation partners. Jim Duffy : As a follow-up to that, can you maybe build on that with comments about opportunities to use data to better anticipate consumer demand and how that dovetails with the speed to market initiatives? Mark Parker : Yeah. That\u2019s a great question. In that zone, one of the things, which is a huge, let\u2019s say, benefit of the consumer direct strategy is to have better knowledge of the consumers. It\u2019s one of the things that we continue to work on, which is to be able to have a better read on the demand from the consumers and then turn that demand directly into how we come back and give them the person they actually want. The part about membership is that we also get to know who actually wants what and what they desire so that\u2019s part of the vision that we\u2019re working through, which is why data is fundamentally important to understanding the consumer, who\u2019s buying, why they\u2019re buying, what they want, what is trending and how we can then put all that information back into our product creation cycle quickly to then bring, so we can scale against those opportunities, so it\u2019s a key piece. Trevor Edwards : That\u2019s -- actually this is a huge part of NIKE\u2019s future, and frankly, many, many other companies is capturing and interpreting that data, turning it into insights, personalizing services, experience, and of course, products. And that\u2019s going to happen at the local level and then we\u2019re going to aggregate that more effectively at the Inc. level. Mark Parker : Thank you, Jim. Jim Duffy : Thank you very much. Mark Parker : Thanks, Jim. Operator, we\u2019ll take one last question. Operator : The last question is from Matthew McClintock from Barclays. Matthew McClintock : Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in. Mark Parker : Hi. Matthew McClintock : On brand Jordan, I was actually wondering if we could talk about brand Jordan, continued strong growth there, $3 billion of revenue, as you look into fiscal \u201818, what makes you most excited about the opportunities for that brand specifically and then can you talk more about your efforts to transcend the brand beyond its basketball roots and into other product categories such as Apparel? Thanks. Trevor Edwards : Yeah. Certainly. Obviously we continue to be truly excited about the opportunity of brand Jordan and how brand Jordan continues to perform. So it had a great year and we envision that it will have a great year next year again. One of the areas that we continue to work on is expanding the different consumer groups that we connect with. One clear opportunity for us is certainly the women\u2019s business, which we see tremendous passion for the brand coming through there, so we will grow the business there in addition to continuing to drive its connection with Basketball, so the NBA partnership actually allows us to do some things with brand Jordan. So we\u2019re very, very excited there. And we will continue to actually sign more athletes and teams against that business. So we recently did UNC Football, so all of those are really just examples of how we\u2019re expanding the actual positioning of that brand to tap into new consumer groups. Andy Campion : $3 billion is an impressive milestone for Jordan, but the international potential for growth is, as we mentioned is really significant going forward. Apparel is still underpenetrated and then as Trevor mentioned, categories beyond Basketball and Sportswear are wide open. The Jordan brand has a huge base, a huge following not just here in the U.S. but around the world, so we\u2019re excited about capitalizing on that and taking the brand to more people around the world. So this is a huge growth opportunity for NIKE going forward. Trevor Edwards : Yeah. I didn\u2019t mention Apparel and Apparel also continues to grow at a tremendous rate. So again, just great opportunity around that portfolio and we\u2019re absolutely committed to seeing it grow around the world. Andy Campion : It\u2019s also a place where we can leverage NIKE technology and NIKE innovation in a new way. We can interpret that through the Jordan lens and that creates more opportunity for us as well. Matthew McClintock : Thanks a lot. Mark Parker : All right. Well, thank you, Matt. I think that\u2019s all the time we have for today. Thank you all for joining us and we\u2019ll speak with you next quarter. Take care. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

In the event, you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to requeue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker. Mark Parker : Thanks, Nitesh, and good afternoon, everyone. Last quarter, we began our conversation with three consumer insights that are driving today\u2019s marketplace shifts : the appetite for a constant flow of fresh and innovative product, the expectation of superior service and the demand for real-time delivery. To stay ahead of these needs, we\u2019ve done what successful companies do, evolve and lead through a time of change. We\u2019ve aligned into a new formation that Consumer Direct Offense, just focused on reinventing our business and the industry. And while changing your approach is never easy, NIKE has proven before that when we do, it\u2019s always ignited the next phase of growth for our company. We\u2019ve had to make some tough choices with our teams. We\u2019ve tested and learned and we got better. Looking back to the creation of the category offense in 2007, we went from being organized against footwear, apparel and equipment to realigning through the eyes of consumers by sport. With the new Consumer Direct Offense, we\u2019re taking that consumer connection one step further. We\u2019re going deeper. We\u2019re connecting more personally to help each individual make the right choice for them. That\u2019s incredibly powerful for a brand that motivates people to do more. And to make that vision a reality at scale, we\u2019re taking some bold steps. We\u2019re breaking old models and we\u2019re fully realigning our teams to be more personal by adding resources to our fastest-growing cities, editing our lines to create more choice on top-selling products, investing in better data and analytics to sense market shifts faster, activating new product creation teams focused only on speed to market and we\u2019re leading with mobile. In the last 90 days, we have moved through the final stages of this realignment. Before reviewing what we\u2019ve accomplished, let\u2019s look at the numbers. NIKE, Inc. first quarter revenues were $9.1 billion, flat to prior year on both a reported and currency-neutral basis. Gross margin was 43.7%, down 180 basis points to prior year. Earnings per share was $0.57, down 22% in the prior year, and we delivered ROIC of 32%. In Q1, we made meaningful progress against our triple-double strategy; 2X Innovation, 2X Direct and 2X Speed. Let\u2019s start, of course, with two times innovation. The foundation for NIKE success will always be inspiring an innovative product. It\u2019s the source of creative storytelling, it\u2019s how we drive distinction in the marketplace and it\u2019s a competitive advantage under any market conditions. We\u2019ve talked a lot about accelerating both the cadence and impact of innovation. And in the last few weeks alone, we\u2019ve introduced the lightest and most breathable high-performance NBA Jersey ever, one of the most anticipated sneaker releases of the year with a collection of reconstructed icons called The Ten and basketball innovation that delivers on the right balance of performance and style with a highly-tuned and detail-obsessed Jordan 32 and the LeBron 15 with the new high-strength Flyknit Battle construction and articulated Max Zoom cushioning system. We know that creating innovation with impact requires more than the launch of a single style. Impact really comes from scale. Air Max is a great example of that this quarter, where energy and performance is being led by VaporMax and where we\u2019ve increased access to high-demand classics like Air Max 97. Stay tuned, we have exciting new Air Max platforms on the way soon. Our latest cushioning platforms, ZoomX and NIKE React, have been getting strong reviews from the most demanding runners and basketball players. And this spring, we\u2019ll bring the sensation of NIKE React to even more sports and to the streets. A few weeks ago, we unveiled a fully sustainable leather called Flyleather, which is a real game changer. It\u2019s 40% lighter, five times more durable and has an 80% lower carbon footprint than traditional leather manufacturing. You can look for Flyleather versions of our most iconic footwear styles soon. In apparel, we also have some exciting new developments with Flyknit technology. To push both performance and style, the new Flyknit bra is a great example and just a start. We always rally behind big sports moments. In this quarter, nothing was bigger than NIKE and the NBA. I mentioned the NBA Jersey. We not only unveiled new court \u2013 on-court innovation, we also introduced NIKE Connect, our first step into an era of digitally-connected products. We see great potential ahead to link future product with services and experiences in seamless ways. There\u2019s also a massive commercial opportunity that comes from working directly with the NBA. With the three most authentic basketball brands, NIKE, Jordan and Converse, we will drive growth for performance products and connect the energy of the NBA to sneakers, style and the culture around the game. That\u2019s the kind of consistency across performance, style and sustainability that we can expect to deliver. And all told, the lineup for the rest of fiscal 2018 is even more impressive, so we can tell better stories, increase demand and accelerate full price sell-through. One of the topics on everybody\u2019s mind is the overall marketplace, which is why 2X Direct is so important to our growth. One point I want to make clear is that, this approach is about serving all of our consumers globally. It\u2019s more than transforming a developed market like North America. It\u2019s also about accelerating developing markets as well. Our international business is now over 55% of our revenue, and there\u2019s much more opportunity ahead in our developing markets. That\u2019s why we focus on a market like China, for example, where 2X Direct works so well. With an economy that\u2019s being driven by digital natives, they bypassed old models, naturally blending digital and physical retail and shopping within their social channels. In contrast, a developed market like North America must embrace change to its legacy retail infrastructure. As the leader, we\u2019re fully committed to energizing and growing the marketplace through both our own NIKE Direct businesses and with strategic wholesale partners. Although it\u2019s a shifting landscape in North America, our industry has key advantages over other retail sectors. In sport, storytelling expertise and service matter, people need and seek guidance, and for the sport and sneaker consumer, mobile is the first step in any search for the right product. The key is for our experiences to feel special, and that could mean a personal one-to-one interaction, reserving products based on a consumer\u2019s shopping history or as simple as delivering products within hours. Our vision is for every consumer who engages with the NIKE Brand to enjoy an elevated consistent experience regardless of channel. That\u2019s why we\u2019re working so closely with a select group of our strategic partners to define the new consumer experience together. Our most progressive partners are already testing elevated and digitally integrated consumer concepts. Others are just beginning their acceleration. And with the new commerce partners, we\u2019re really pushing the boundaries of existing models. Retailers who don\u2019t embrace distinction will be left behind. While the transformation maybe difficult for some, NIKE will lead the industry to come out much stronger. One pilot this quarter, as an example is that, which combines a consumer personalization 2X Direct and 2X Speed and that was our live design experience as a Nike By You Studio in New York. This will reengage the consumer to generate custom graphics and colors, and we build the shoe onsite and have it ready to take home in an hour. There\u2019s a lot of great learning here that we\u2019re connecting back to our broader membership plans. 2X Speed is coming to life in other ways across the company. On the larger scale, we\u2019re capturing more real-time demand, while delivering end-to-end benefits to our entire product creation cycle. A few specific examples this quarter from around the world include a quick return T-shirt process with Foot Locker in North America that resulted in higher sell-through and growth in our T-shirt business. In EMEA, an expansion of our replenishment programs with icons like Air Max 90 and Air Force 1 that drove a significant uplift in sales. And our new Asia Express Lane is already making an impact to our business in China, where it\u2019s accelerated our fleets business. We plan to provide much more dimension of all our growth accelerators at our upcoming Investor Day next month. And we\u2019ll show you in detail how personal and mobile are fueling our transformation into the Consumer Direct Offense, and how we\u2019re creating sustained growth for our company, the industry and our shareholders for years to come. Thanks. And now here is Trevor. Trevor Edwards : Thank you, Mark. Let\u2019s start with the financials. As always, my comments are on a constant currency basis. For the quarter, NIKE Brand revenue grew 2% and revenue in our NIKE Direct business was up a 11%, driven by online growth of 19%, new stores and comp store growth of 5%. Mark mentioned how NIKE evolves and leads through times of change. By leveraging the power of sport, time and again, we authentically connect with consumers through premium innovative product and elevated services led by digital and mobile. Our Consumer Direct Offense accelerates that work through a more personal lens. And by infusing digital in how we bring our brand to life for consumers, we invent new ways to connect more closely with them. It all comes down to serving the consumer completely. Our ability to connect breakthrough technologies to our brand-defining energy and emotion has us incredibly excited about the future. It\u2019s with this focus that we take the sports industry into the next era of digital. Now, let\u2019s talk about how that work comes to life through our key categories. First, NIKE basketball. The NBA partnership is now in full force, and we are confident about what it means for us and our consumers. First of all, of course, we are elevating performance through innovation with the lightest and most breathable NBA Jersey ever. At the same time, the NIKE NBA connected jersey is much more than a uniform. It\u2019s a digitally-enabled jersey that drives a new level of service for fans to tap into the game they love and get insider access to their favorite teams, players and special products. Above all, it\u2019s a premium and personal membership experience that fuels a direct emotional connection and allows us to serve them better. The jersey experience will unlock a new \u2013 a brand-new world of connection for members. For example, NBA players can now connect directly to fans who own their jersey, sending them personalized exclusive messages instantly to their phones. That\u2019s the future we\u2019re really excited about, both as a brand and as a business. In basketball footwear, the Kyrie 3 continues to be the number one selling performance basketball shoe. Also, in the quarter, the KD 10 showed incredibly strong sell-through. And of course, NIKE continues to lead in elevating the culture of the game, thanks to our full basketball offense stretching across the spectrum of performance and sportswear. Proving the power of that spectrum is the new Therma Flex Showtime Jacket, the first hoodie to be worn on the court during game time. The Showtime Jacket celebrates a style of the game by refreshing a beloved apparel icon into a new performance product for athletes on and off the court. Our NBA partnership is inspiring new exciting footwear as well, with eight new NBA exclusive colorways of the Air Force 1 offering just a taste of what\u2019s to come. Ultimately, we are confident that with this complete offense, we will fuel the game of basketball globally. Of course, the NBA partnership also elevates the Jordan Brand as the Jumpman logo will now be seen on NBA jerseys with a few more surprising spotlights for the Jordan Brand to come. And with the Jordan Brand\u2019s expansion into new countries and new dimensions beyond basketball like women\u2019s footwear, Jordan is setting the foundation for sustainable long-term growth. Global appetite for the brand remains extremely strong. For example, in Greater China, new expressions of the Jordan Brand like the Jordan 1 Retro High Flyknit have been incredibly successful. That said, in North America, within the retro side of the business, we\u2019re managing the cadence of our launches, while bringing to market fresher stories and expressions that drive demand. Over the balance of the year, we\u2019re focused on new ways of delivering on the exclusivity and the aspiration that is expected by fans of this iconic brand. In Running, we are leading the way with key products that translate our deep understanding of runners into groundbreaking performance innovation. The Zoom platform saw strong consumer response from the Pegasus 34 to the Zoom Fly to the Vaporfly 4%, which sold out completely in quarter one. As we revitalized some of our core footwear running franchises, in just the last three months, Air VaporMax grabbed the number one market share in the United States at the $150 and up price point. The success we\u2019re seeing with the VaporMax is lifting our entire air platform. And it underscores that when we deliver performance innovation and distinction, there\u2019s always demand at a premium price. Meanwhile, our sportswear category continues to impress. In Q1, NIKE Sportswear\u2019s momentum resulted in the largest revenue quarter ever. Thanks in part to the iconic styles, such as the Presto and the Air Force 1. Our women sportswear product like the Cortez and the Air Max Jewell also seen strong response in the market. And we continue to fuel growth through digital, with sportswear growing high double digits on nike.com. The sportswear category is also a great way to bring to life our key city approach, where we create energy with consumers in the most influential hubs of sport and style. Now, as Mark mentioned, this past quarter in New York, we launched OFF-CAMPUS, a collaboration with Virgil Abloh. There we introduced new energy for 10 of the most iconic shoes, while engaging with those who love the design and function of sneakers. Overall, our categories highlight what our new formation under the Consumer Direct Offense can accomplish, creating a vision and a journey for consumer that serves them better and more personally. Most importantly, they provide a roadmap for the future. This is particularly true as we leverage this approach to reignite strong momentum in North America. And of course, as we surgically apply the blueprint in all markets, we look to accelerate our already strong international growth as well. Let\u2019s take a look at these geographies now. In Q1, North America was down low single digits, as we continue to proactively manage the marketplace supply. However, the momentum in sportswear continued, along with new innovations like the VaporMax and the LeBron 15 driving performance distinction for the brand. Women\u2019s had a powerful quarter with popular premium executions from the Chrome Blush, a new collection of stylish workout gear that led to a strong performance in the market to membership accelerators like the Air Society, a network that serves to connect and empower creative-minded women. For North America, as we manage the marketplace, we are scaling our new innovations to reignite strong momentum with our strategic partners, such as Dixon Foot Locker, as well as accelerating growth in our own NIKE Direct business. At the same time, we still see a dynamic and promotional landscape, one that is having a pronounced impact on physical retail, especially in light of the continued consumer shifts towards digital. This is exactly why we are focused on elevating those differentiated and better service experience that consumers are voting for. For example, in our own digital business, in North America, we have a greater opportunity to accelerate growth by editing our assortment and delivering greater depth of the best product that consumers covet. And while we expect to see continued shifts in the broader U.S. marketplace, the solutions are clear. It\u2019s about leveraging the power of our brand, continuing to tell powerful stories that lift up the NIKE Brand and then using that brand strength to drive deeper relationships with consumers as we connect more personally and more directly. Fundamentally, we are bullish about the long-term opportunity in North America, as consumers continue to accelerate their pursuit for healthy and active lifestyles. We are confident in our ability to extend our leadership position over the long-term and reinvigorate growth in this region. In our new EMEA geography, we saw results up single digits, driven by sportswear in global football and with strong cross-categorical growth in apparel. We also saw strong energy in JD Sports and Zalando, two strategic partners who are leading the marketplace transformation. Digital, led by mobile remains a key driver for us in this region. For example, nike.com in London grew 60% over the prior year. Last quarter, we expanded our sneakers out to Europe adding 19 new markets and their performance is outpacing expectations. In EMEA, as in North America, we continue to grow the number of buying members in our ecosystem, fueled in part by a steady refresh of premium products like the Air VaporMax Colorways. And perhaps most important to this region is our global football business. Along with our New Chelsea and Tottenham partnerships, the continued energy we see with top players like Neymar and Cristiano Ronaldo and the upcoming World Cup in Russia, this region is primed for continued strength. Finally, in Greater China, we continue to see incredible results with revenue growing double digits for the quarter. The breadth and depth of our relationship with the Chinese consumer doesn\u2019t just continue our success in this geography, it accelerates it. In Q1, we drove incredible sports energy in the market, particularly with our athlete tours. This summer, we brought real heat to the market with visits from Cristiano Ronaldo, Lebron James, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant and the NBA \u2013 MVP Russell Westbrook. These tours drove deeper relationship between athlete and their fans throughout the country. This energy can be felt by the 500 million daily uses on Tmall, where NIKE is the number one sports brand. Just a few months ago, we opened a Jordan door on Tmall, which drove more than 2 million shoppers in the first 10 days, highlighting the tremendous growth we see in this vital retail platform. To capitalize on this growing market, we\u2019re investing to serve consumers where they shop. For example, in Beijing, celebrating two decades for the Jordan Brand in Greater China, we opened the largest Jordan door in Asia with our partner Tao Shen. Featuring hyperlocal customization, trial-in and services, this retail experience celebrates the brand\u2019s legacy, the culture of the city and most importantly it inspires the future. Our success in China also offers a reminder that no matter what may be happening in the United States retail, NIKE is positioned for continued sustainable growth. The power and consistency of our global portfolio gives us tremendous confidence for the NIKE Brand going forward. In the end, at a time when consumers have elevated their expectations, we feel great about where we are. The worldwide strength of our brand, the power of our innovative products and the largest digital presence in our industry gives us the opportunity to serve at a scale and depth that is unmatched. Thanks. Now here\u2019s Andy. Andy Campion : Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and hello, everyone, on the call. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, we delivered revenue and profitability in line with the expectations that we set for ourselves 90 days ago, despite an increasingly dynamic environment in the U.S. However more important than our financial results in any individual quarter are the actions we\u2019re taking to accelerate our Consumer Direct Offense and how those actions are igniting NIKE\u2019s next horizon of long-term growth. First, the Consumer Direct Offense is fueling strong momentum in our international geographies, which as Mark noted, now represent over 55% of our total revenue. In many of our developing markets, current marketplace structures are well suited to NIKE serving consumers more personally at scale through our new Offence, China is the best example. Today, over 90% of our business in China is already transacted through a NIKE branded experiences, digital and physical, both owned and operated through partners. We\u2019re also leveraging close to market manufacturing to enable our Express Lane in China and in other markets across Asia. That is a tremendous platform upon which to accelerate, both our speed and our NIKE Direct initiatives. In many of our international markets where we are executing this new offence with tailwinds from strong growth in consumer spending, an emerging middle class and increasing participation in sport. While the current platform in a market like China is a great foundation, we nonetheless see tremendous opportunity to accelerate growth by expanding the reach of NIKE branded experiences across key cities and increasingly leveraging digital to better serve consumers across all touch points. As Trevor highlighted, in Q1, we launched new digital platforms across many of our international markets, including a curated Jordan flagship experience on Tmall, which is China\u2019s largest digital commerce platform and the launch of our sneakers app in 19 new countries across EMEA. Initiatives such as these power nike.com growth of over 40% across our international geographies in Q1. Second, over the past 90 days, it has become increasingly evident to all that the North America marketplace is undergoing significant transformation. Several quarters ago, we said that the U.S. retail landscape was not in a steady state, but rather would continue to be disrupted by the accelerating consumer shift to digital and more personal brand experiences. We anticipated those shifts and that served as the foundation for our 2X Direct strategy. That said, those shifts are now profoundly impacting the more undifferentiated dimensions of retail, resulting in store closures, bankruptcies and a promotional environment in the short-term. Amidst this unprecedented disruption in U.S. retail, we have maintained to slightly increase our market share in the U.S. in aggregate across our NIKE Direct and wholesale businesses. Nonetheless, we are currently acting on category specific opportunities to even better serve consumers. For example, as Trevor noted, in Q1, we created strong consumer demand at a premium price point with the new Air VaporMax platform that crosses over from running to sportswear. We will continue attacking those opportunities with the launch and scaling of new innovative products over the balance of the year. And we are transforming the retail landscape to grow the market and create even further separation long-term. In our NIKE Direct businesses, growth continues to far outpace the broader marketplace, as we leverage digital to enhance the consumer experience. We look forward to sharing greater insight into our vision for the future of the North America marketplace and how we are executing against that vision at our Investor Day in October. Third, the Consumer Direct Offense is driving a more sharply focused investment agenda at NIKE. In Q1, we realigned our organization against this new offense and began accelerating the strategic investments required to deliver on our vision. We continue to increase investment in product innovation, and to enhance our speed, we\u2019re investing in the Express Lane and new demand and supply management capabilities. Finally, as we target doubling our direct connection to consumers, we are ramping up investment in digital capabilities ranging from data science and analytics to machine learning to augmented reality to image recognition and personalization. We will continue to use our unrivalled resources to ensure that NIKE is built to win now and for the long-term. Now let\u2019s discuss our first quarter results. NIKE, Inc. Q1 revenue was flat on a reported and constant currency basis, as strong momentum in our international geographies and in our NIKE Direct businesses globally was offset by a decline in North America wholesale revenue. First quarter diluted EPS decreased 22% to $0.57, driven by planned gross margin contraction and a higher effective tax rate, which were partially offset by a slight SG&A leverage and a lower average share count. Gross margin contracted 180 basis points in Q1, primarily driven by 130 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds and to a lesser extent a higher mix of off-price sales. Those factors were partially offset by lower product costs. Total SG&A was down 1% in Q1, due primarily to an 18% decline in demand creation, driven by prior year investment around key global sporting events, as well as phasing of demand creation spend in fiscal year 2018. The decline in demand creation was mostly offset by an increase in operating overhead, due to costs associated with realigning our organization against the Consumer Direct Offense and continued strategic investments to fuel growth, including investment in mobile to expand our NIKE and sneakers apps globally. The effective tax rate was a 11.4% in Q1, compared to 2.5% for the same period last year, reflecting the tax benefit of stock-based compensation in the current period under the new accounting standard, as well as a one-time benefit related to the resolution with the IRS of a foreign tax credit matter in the prior year. As of August 31, inventories were up 6%, driven by a higher average cost per unit, primarily due to product mix and to a lesser extent changes in foreign currency exchange rates and growth in our NIKE Direct businesses. Now, let\u2019s discuss the financial performance for a few of our operating segments. In the first quarter, North America revenue declined 3% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis in line with the expectations we shared last quarter. The decrease in revenue was a function of short-term promotional headwinds in the broader marketplace, which were partially offset by continued growth in our NIKE Direct businesses. EBIT was flat to prior year as a short-term contraction in gross margin was offset by lower demand creation expense, primarily as a result of prior year comparisons. And inventories for the quarter were down 2% compared to prior year, as we continue to manage supply and demand tightly. In the short to medium-term, we will prudently manage risk as we focus on accelerating a shift in the composition of the market to experiences that consumers are increasingly telling us that they love. Those being digitally-enabled experiences that bring together the best of NIKE\u2019s brand, product and services. For NIKE, that begins with nike.com, mobile experiences, such as our NIKE and sneakers apps and NIKE-owned stores. Our 2X Direct strategy will extend into the broader marketplace through new experiences that we are creating with strategic partners, such as Foot Locker and DICK\u2019S Sporting Goods that will bring the NIKE Brand closer to our consumer. Turning to EMEA. Q1 revenue was up 5% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by growth in footwear and apparel and all key categories. We saw high double-digit growth in the UK marketplace and our NIKE Direct businesses, including double-digit comp growth. Normalizing for the comparison against prior year events and the impact of a cyber attack on one of our European logistics providers, currency neutral revenue growth would have been more in line with recent quarterly trends. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue increased 4% and EBIT declined 7%, primarily driven by the impact of transactional FX headwinds on gross margin. In Greater China, we delivered 12% currency neutral revenue growth, with double-digit growth across both footwear and apparel and fueled by our NIKE Direct businesses. We also continue to see strong growth in our NIKE branded experiences with partners and in nearly all key categories. again, we see continued momentum in China over the balance of fiscal year 2018, as well as a tremendous opportunity to deliver long-term growth through our new offense. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue grew 9% and EBIT expanded 6%, as strong revenue growth was slightly offset by lower gross margin, primarily due to significant transactional FX headwinds. Revenue in our APLA geography, which essentially combines our former emerging markets in Japan geographies grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis. We recorded multidimensional growth across footwear and apparel, NIKE Direct and wholesale, all key categories and most territories. On a reported basis, Q1 revenue increased 5% and EBIT increased 24%, driven by revenue growth and lower demand creation, following significant investments in the prior year against the Olympics in Brazil. And finally, Converse revenue declined 16% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis, as high double-digit growth in China was more than offset by a purposeful tightening of supply in North America. EBIT decreased 42%, driven by declining revenue, gross margin contraction from higher closeout in North America and SG&A leverage. I\u2019ll now move on to our outlook. Looking ahead, our overall outlook is generally in line with the guidance that we provided 90 days ago. We see continued strong momentum in our international geographies and we now expect slightly lesser headwinds from foreign exchange net of hedging. We believe there will be short-term headwinds within the U.S. retail landscape that will dampen growth. NIKE\u2019s primary measure of success in North America in the near-term will be driving growth in our NIKE Direct businesses and through new NIKE consumer experiences with our strategic partners. As for specific guidance, for Q2, we expect reported revenue growth in the low single-digit range, with contraction in our North America geography and Converse to be more than offset by strong international growth. For the full-year, we continue to expect reported revenue growth in the mid single-digit range. In Q2, we expect gross margin to contract at approximately the same rate we saw in Q1, with FX continuing to be the single largest driver. For the full-year, we now believe the challenging dynamics in the U.S. retail landscape could result in our gross margin contracting between 50 and 100 basis points versus prior year. For total SG&A, we expect Q2 to grow low double digits. For the full-year, we continue to expect SG&A growth in the mid single-digit range. We will continue to manage operating overhead prudently, while remaining on the offence investing to : one, drive brand heat and distinction; two amplify our launch of new innovative products; and three, build the capabilities required to enable speed and direct connections to consumers. We expect other income and expense net of interest expense to be approximately $30 million to $40 million in expense in Q2 and $80 million in expense for the full-year. And finally, we now expect our effective tax rate will be between approximately 15% and 17% for the full-year. We have operated in dynamic circumstances before and in every instance being on the offence and consumer-focused has served us well. Our organization is now realigned against our new Consumer Direct Offence and we\u2019re all energized by the opportunity to ignite yet another horizon of strong sustainable growth in NIKE. We look forward to sharing deeper perspectives into our vision and long-term growth strategy at our Investor Day next month. With that, we\u2019ll now open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim. Robert Drbul : Hi, guys, good afternoon. Mark Parker : Hey, Rob. Robert Drbul : I guess, the question that I had just to start is, when you look at the \u2013 like just the revenue expectation for the remainder of the year, what\u2019s giving you guys the confidence in the acceleration throughout the next few quarters to get to that mid single-digit full-year reported revenue growth projection for this year? Mark Parker : Well, I\u2019m going to jump in first here. First of all, I think it\u2019s the product that we\u2019ve got in the pipeline, what\u2019s coming. I mean, bottom line is consumer votes through the innovation and the product that we create. And I\u2019m very bullish, we\u2019re very bullish on what\u2019s coming down the pipeline. So we think that will give us opportunity obviously for \u2013 to reenergize some of the growth here in the U.S. market, North America, as well as continue to drop some of the success and momentum that we\u2019re seeing internationally. I think, there\u2019s a lot of good brand energy moments also in the works. And when you boil it down, having energy around products and the brand is the foundation. The obsession we have with the consumer with this new offence that we have in play, I think, you\u2019ll see that come to light in some new and quite dramatic ways. Trevor Edwards : Yes, and Bob I\u2019ll just add that, as I mentioned, we continue to expect mid single-digit reported revenue growth for the full-year. And the three primary drivers of that are continued very strong international momentum. Two, we see strong growth and some acceleration on our NIKE Direct businesses. And at the same time, we are seeing a bit of a favorable impact on our real dollar growth from the recent dollar weakening. Robert Drbul : Got it. And then you talked about North American, your North American inventory is down 2%. On the Jordan business, can you break that out for us, and can you just talk about where you think inventories are at the retail partners that you have product at? Trevor Edwards : Yes, I\u2019ll certainly about the Jordan brand and maybe just give some context there. One thing, I think, the Jordan brand has been incredibly strong over so many years. And it\u2019s certainly been the leading edge of performance, street style and culture. And it\u2019s really inspiring consumers all over the world to really have covet those premium products. What we\u2019re seeing is, we\u2019re seeing this clear growth in China, which is exceeding 30%, as we connect to a new generation of consumers there. And at the same time in North America, we\u2019re certainly going to continue to manage the cadence of launches, while bringing some fresher stories into the marketplace. And this is where we\u2019re going to really manage in the balance between scarcity and scale at the same time. So we\u2019re taking all the right steps to make sure that Jordan remains a special and coveted brand, and I\u2019m confident with the areas that we\u2019re \u2013 that what we\u2019re doing. What I\u2019m most excited about with the Jordan brand is, is how strong the brand is with consumers, and it continues to be a great driver of energy and we\u2019ve seen some great product lineups coming through. And with the Jordan 32, that\u2019s coming through, the Jordan 1 Flyknit and the upcoming footwear, we continue to be really excited. So a lot more is coming there, and I hope that gives you a good context of where the Jordan is. Andy Campion : And Bob, I\u2019ll just add on inventory. Globally, we\u2019re very pleased with our positioning. There are different dynamics across each region, of course. In the U.S., we have been vigilant and will remain vigilant managing supply and demand. And as you noted that led to a decline of 2% in inventories. Frankly, that is in part driven by our anticipation of some of this disruption in the retail marketplace, which again we began to note several quarters ago and managed prudently as a result. But we again are very pleased with the inventory position that we have in North America. Robert Drbul : Got it. If I could just ask one more quick one. With all the focus on the NBA, can you talk a little bit about if you\u2019re more excited to have Kyrie in Boston, or you have Carmelo in OKC with Russell and Paul George? Andy Campion : Bob, I\u2019m from Cleveland, so I\u2019m going to miss Kyrie. All right. Thanks, Bob. We\u2019ll take our next question. Robert Drbul : All right. Operator : Your next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs. Lindsay Drucker Mann : Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I was hoping to ask my first question on North America. Andy, last quarter your guidance you talked about North America being down slight for the first-half of the year with an improving cadence to finish off the year up. Could you talk about how you\u2019re in light of the industry disruptions you talked about in your new perspective on the North American market? How we should be thinking about the cadence for North America in 2Q and exiting the year? Andy Campion : Sure. We do anticipate continued marketplace disruption in North America. And so in the short-term, there are implications of that disruption that will likely be beyond our control, for instance, how certain retailers may be responding to some of these challenges, door closures and the precise timing of those potential discontinuities. That said, over the course of this year, you\u2019re going to see us embracing as we have been and accelerating the shifts in the marketplace, because our focus has been and always will be on responding to what we\u2019re seeing from the consumer. We see the consumer shifting to digital and to deeper brand connections. And we believe that\u2019s a tremendous growth opportunity over the medium to longer-term and actually will fuel some of our growth in the short-term. So our measure of success in North America in fiscal year 2018 will primarily center around accelerating our direct-to-consumer businesses, and also accelerating the work that we\u2019re doing with our strategic partners to reshape the broader marketplace. But given all of these dynamics just one quarter into the year, it\u2019s unclear and I wouldn\u2019t say precisely where North America will end for the full fiscal year. Trevor Edwards : Yes, and I\u2019d just probably add that, one area that we know that we\u2019re very confident about is that, it really all starts and ends with a great product. And we continue to feel great about the product launches that are coming up and the brand energy that we create around that. So we\u2019re really focused on scaling those innovations that we\u2019ve currently seeded, whether that\u2019s the Air VaporMax or the ZoomX and React, which clearly has other opportunities across other categories. We\u2019re also going to continue to elevate the brand to bring the brand to a higher level, so the consumers will absolutely feel the impact of our brands for the remainder of the year. So you\u2019re going to see that kind of come through pretty strong. The other area, I would say is that, we are going to continue to sort of attack in season opportunities using our Express Lane, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been focused to create that capability, so that we can respond with great items like the Air Force 1 or the VaporMax and even on the apparel side. So while it might not be as easy for you to see all of the momentum that\u2019s in the marketplace, I can certainly say, when you dive in deeper, we can see the momentum when you really \u2013 when we really focus on that direct connection that we have with consumers whether that\u2019s in our direct retail or when that you\u2019re coming to one of our partners. So that\u2019s how we, let\u2019s say, a better read on the underlying momentum that\u2019s actually going on in North America. Lindsay Drucker Mann : Got it. But to clarify, is there any, as we think about sort of 2Q for North America, are you looking for it to be consistent with what we saw in 1Q better or worse as far as revenue goes? Andy Campion : Yes, we \u2013 as we said on the last call, Lindsay, we expect \u2013 we expected and we continue to expect a slight contraction in the first part of the year. As Trevor noted, we have some things in store from a product innovation and from a marketplace perspective with our direct-to-consumer businesses and with our partners who are increasingly coming to us to help them also reshape the consumer experience recognizing our deep connection as a brand and leadership position with consumers. So we\u2019ll update you on the outlook over the balance of the year. But again, as I said, it\u2019s a little early in the year to be overly precise about where North America will land based on some of the dynamics. Lindsay Drucker Mann : Okay, got it. And then my second question is just on, you guys have talked about the significance of keeping the in line channel clean. And I think, Amazon Marketplace makes that challenging, because a lot of three key products from unlicensed dealers ends up there \u2013 can end up there are markdown. Do you expect your new partnership with Amazon will allow you to manage the visibility of unlicensed products on marketplace? Mark Parker : Well, I\u2019m not going to go into that level of detail. I will say that pilot that we\u2019ve been running with Amazon is still in the early stages. And what we\u2019ve seen so far is progressing actually quite well, excited about the possibilities going forward. We\u2019ve proven, I think, through our ability to create some real great success with other consumer-oriented digital partners like Tmall and Zalando that there isn\u2019t a real opportunity here, and we\u2019re excited about where that can go with Amazon. It\u2019s still early yet, not much more I can share with you today, but look forward to, as Andy said, on another topic to sharing more at the investor meeting and as the pilot progresses. Nitesh Sharan : Thanks, Lindsay. Now we\u2019ll take the next question, please. Operator? Operator : Your next question is from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : Thanks. Good afternoon. Mark Parker : Yes, good afternoon, Omar. Omar Saad : I wanted to \u2013 thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on some of Mark\u2019s, I thought kind of interesting comments about around retail and the need to change and embrace change, and you alluded to some new commerce partners doing some innovation \u2013 innovative things there. And maybe you can expand on that and kind of some extent without pointing fingers talk about how you expect the landscape to change, and what NIKE\u2019s role will be in the coming years? Mark Parker : Well, first of all, I think, it\u2019s important to distinguish between some of the near-term dynamics, as compared to the longer-term shifts and consumer preferences. The good news from a backdrop standpoint is that consumers I think are really increasingly passionate about leading an active healthy lifestyle, and that\u2019s obviously in North America, but around the world. And I think the rise of digital, mobile and social, that\u2019s amplifying the influence of sport on culture. So that\u2019s all good news and that continues to be the case. There\u2019s always that shift that takes place back and forth naturally between sportswear and the performance side of the business. And we\u2019re seeing a real symbiotic relationship between those two sides and trying to take advantage of that as best we can. And then there\u2019s the shift with the market landscape and the digital influence is obviously having a profound effect on what that landscape looks like. We are with the new offense are trying to accelerate that change, not to catch up, but to move ahead of the consumer. And we realize that a really important ingredient there is the partnerships that we create. We mentioned Tmall in China and Zalando in Europe and Amazon is a possibility here, but there\u2019s many others as well. The wholesale partners we\u2019ve had are making the shift as well to the emphasis on digital as part of their retail profile. And NIKE Direct through our own efforts is becoming a bigger more important part of our overall profile, and I think that\u2019s going to continue. We are with this new offense experimenting with a lot of new ideas at a small scale and looking at taking those ideas to scale as part of this new offense, and that\u2019s creating a lot of energy and excitement within the company. And honestly, I\u2019d say, that\u2019s newer for NIKE to be pushing as aggressively as we are with experimenting with those concepts ourselves and then with partners. We\u2019re definitely wired in the same way. Andy Campion : And Omar, to add maybe a few examples, since we announced the strategy, a number of the examples of what Mark just spoke to are expanding our sneakers and Nike+ apps globally from North America to Europe and Asia, partnership with Nordstrom, dedicated NIKE in Nordstrom page for women on their app and in-store experience, the pilot with Amazon that Mark mentioned, new Sneaker Boutique in London. And then looking ahead to our Investor Day without going into too much detail in this call, but we\u2019ll be sharing some new experiences relative to nike.com, as well as membership experiences that we believe are very much in line with where the consumer is headed and will accelerate growth in North America, but also beyond, as well as some physical experiences that we think could create compelling environments at retail, both owned and with our strategic partners. So stay tuned maybe for a little bit more tangible insight into these themes at Investor Day. Omar Saad : Great. And then one quick follow-up. You made a comment around the lifestyle kind of footwear opportunity going deeper, with \u2013 deeper selection within the certain \u2013 within the key styles. Where are we on that curve? It feels like that\u2019s a big opportunity for the brand, given its heritage, and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s expressing itself in the inventory that\u2019s at retail. How should we think about that side of the business? You just \u2013 you also just kind of mentioned that it\u2019s really getting more tied \u2013 closely tied to the performance side as well? Mark Parker : Yes, there is a real, as I said, it\u2019s kind of a symbiotic relationship between performance and sportswear. We don\u2019t look at it quite as black and white as two separate categories. These are dimensions of the product that kind of intersect and overlap one influences the other. I think it\u2019s clear that the consumer voting today is looking for authentic performance styles, but in styles that are maybe less overtly athletic and more acceptable from a street standpoint. And that doesn\u2019t mean that performance and innovation is any less important, in fact, it creates distinction for us in the sportswear space. And that\u2019s our unique strength of NIKE is that we have that authenticity and performance that we can then translate and express on the sportswear side of the business. And that\u2019s where consumers are focusing and that\u2019s a major shift for us as well and how we \u2013 even how we finish and how we detail our performance product. Trevor Edwards : I\u2019d just add. Certainly, I think, a great example is the Air VaporMax. And I think what we have done with that is, we focused more on that particular style and we have constant variations of that product coming through. So that\u2019s what with them. When we speak about the EDIT to AMPLIFY, that\u2019s what we mean, which is to take a style, focus more, give the consumers more reasons to actually buy that product and certainly come in and give different consumers other dimensions, so they can connect. So we\u2019re seeing that actually work really well. So we\u2019re seeing that. We know that on the sportswear side and we know it on the performance side. For us, as Mark said, it really plays on both styles. So it\u2019s really about creating an amazing product and then dimensionalize it, so that the consumer has more opportunity to connect with that. And when we do that and we storytell it, we see it drive incredible demand in the marketplace. Nitesh Sharan : Thanks, Omar. Omar Saad : Thanks. That\u2019s it. Nitesh Sharan : Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question please. Operator : The next question is from Jim Duffy from Stifel. Jim Duffy : Thanks. Hello, everyone. Mark Parker : Hi, Jim. Jim Duffy : My question around the transition to the more Consumer Direct Offense, even as you push towards implementation of the strategy, we\u2019ve seen direct-to-consumer and e-commerce growth rates flow some. Andy, I think, you mentioned expectations for accelerating growth in direct contemplated in the full-year expectations. Are there unique compares to call out in the first quarter? And then can you give us a preview of some of the key drivers to reaccelerate growth as the year unfolds? Trevor Edwards : Yes, I\u2019ll hit that first, and I\u2019d say that, we continue to see strong growth in our digital business, and it was up 19% for the quarter. As we pointed out, the international piece of that was actually growing at a faster rate, and so that\u2019s what we are seeing. We think there\u2019ll be continued expansion within the international business, so we\u2019ll continue to see that level of growth, because we\u2019re expanded things like our sneaker apps to get to more consumers and more countries in the marketplace. Domestically, one of the areas that we are focused on is allocating deeper assortments of our best products on our sites. So whether it\u2019s on nike.com, or it\u2019s on the X, we\u2019re going to drive a greater focus like we just spoke about on the key styles that we know that the consumers love. And so that\u2019s a clear focus. When we speak about Edit To Amplify, we\u2019re going to apply that very directly to our own nike.com and on the apps. In addition, we are working to make sure that we can have great data where we\u2019re leveraging and reading the marketplace at speed at the consumer speed. So we can bring even some more great items through our Express Lane. And so as we look at it all in all, you\u2019re going to see much more about this at the Investor Day. But the point here is that, we continue to expect that digital will outpace the every other dimension of the marketplace. And we\u2019re certainly putting the right focus and energy to ensure that we deliver that to our consumers. Andy Campion : And Jim, I\u2019d just add. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this very straightforward three-pronged strategy is really driving focus within our investment agenda and not just focus, but acceleration. We still have quite a number of untapped opportunities leveraging data science and analytics, personalization. You can imagine what we would do with image recognition, as a NIKE Brand and the icons that we have. And we have been accelerating our investment in that regard. We\u2019ve both built capabilities and acquired and will continue to do so. And then again, just to reiterate what Trevor said, we will give you some perspective into how some of that comes to life and in terms of membership and our overall digital experience at our Investor Day. Jim Duffy : Okay, very good. It seems a lot of good opportunity from segmentation as it relates to Direct specific to the North American marketplace and your transformation there, are you anticipating any proactive reduction in distribution in North America? Trevor Edwards : I think, as we\u2019ve really spoken about, we\u2019ve continued to say that the consumer is clearly moving to the distribution that is differentiated, that is providing them a clear reason for why they have to go whether that\u2019s online or at a physical store. So the partners that don\u2019t shift in that landscape, that don\u2019t quite create a clear proposition for consumers to come with will clearly shift away from those as the consumer shifts away from those. And so, our intent is to make sure that we are serving the consumers in the best way that they would expect in the marketplace. And so that\u2019s going to create some shifts and we\u2019re going to make some decisive decisions to make sure that we\u2019re meeting that demand where the consumer would expect it. Andy Campion : Yes, I\u2019d just add that, while one of the primary shifts is the consumer shift to digital. The consumer is also telling us, as Trevor and both Trevor and Mark noted, that deeper connections with brands and translating that, that means a higher level of service expertise advice that only a brand like Nike could provide are what are really punching through. And we\u2019ve had a number of partners both North America and globally come to us to join forces and thinking about what a vision for those types of experiences that really bring the NIKE Brand closer to the consumer through that distribution might look like. As for your question about dimensions of the market, that may contract or decline. We are very proactively thinking about those that translates into everything from how we manage risk from a credit perspective just also as well as in terms of how we manage growth with some of those more undifferentiated aspects of retail. We do anticipate a shift, again, we\u2019ll talk more about this at our Investor Day. But what we\u2019re really focused on is what the shift is toward more so than what the shift is away from. Mark Parker : But let me add, as we shift towards we will definitely shift away, though it\u2019s not \u2013 everything is not equal here. I just want to close on that by saying that the obsession that we have in creating that distinction, that retail ourselves and with our partners is making us faster, it\u2019s making us more personal. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re obsessed with right now, that\u2019s our focus. So those are the partners that will definitely move forward with us as a company as a brand. Nitesh Sharan : Thanks, Jim. Jim Duffy : Thank you. Nitesh Sharan : Operator, we\u2019ll take our next question please. Operator : The next question is from Kate McShane from Citi. Kate McShane : Hi, thank you for taking my question. There seems to be a good degree of discounting on the market both in apparel and footwear. And I think even one of the major retailers is talking or mentioning the words price war. So I wondered how that pricing is being managed during this period of disruption? And how do you retrain the customer to accept higher ASPs once inventory is worked through and the disruption is stabilized? Trevor Edwards : Yes, obviously, for us investing in our brand and building relationship with athletes and consumers has always been our top priority. And it really goes without saying, we\u2019re very mindful to make sure that we are protecting our brands and importantly strengthening the brand over the long-term. And one clear lever is map and we\u2019re \u2013 and particularly in the backdrop that you have right now going on in the United States. And we \u2013 so we recently spent a lot of time with our partners and we\u2019ve tightened up our map policy with our retailers and you\u2019ll see that go live very shortly. And we expect it will have a positive impact on the brand and the businesses over the balance of the year and beyond. So that\u2019s clearly a very important piece for us. But at the same time, we will continue to make sure, we\u2019re investing energy in driving our brand at the highest levels and making sure that consumers can get access to the best products. So that\u2019s a really important piece, because we believe that there is a great demand out there for full price. Kate McShane : Okay. Thank you. And if I could just follow-up with an unrelated question with regards to the supply chain. In terms of what progress you made during the quarter and finding more efficiencies and speeding up the supply chain? And it also sounds like maybe some of those investments now are benefiting the gross margin line? Andy Campion : Yes, we will actually talk more about this at the Investor Day. But let me just say that the obsession or the fixation we\u2019ve had on the opportunities around man rev continue to be a central point for us, but we are seeing the effect on the bottom line as well, product cost reductions, more efficiencies in manufacturing we\u2019re taking that to scale, and then we\u2019re seeing some of those really showing up in our cost reduction or product cost reductions as well. And then a lot of this has to do with our Speed initiative, our 2X Speed. So the investments we\u2019re making in manufacturing revolution are really helping to support our Express Lane efforts. So there\u2019s a cost benefit, but there\u2019s also a speed to market benefit. And we\u2019re looking at optimizing both directly and then obviously through our relationships with partners like Flex. Nitesh Sharan : Thanks, Kate. Kate McShane : Thank you. Nitesh Sharan : Operator, we\u2019ll take our last questions please. Operator : The last question is from Simeon Siegel from Nomura Instinet. Simeon Siegel : Thanks. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Just given the comments on the retail disruption at the same time that you\u2019re referencing the North American inventory control, can you just any color on how you view that off-price sales penetration heading over the year and maybe the impact on the margins? Andy Campion : Yes, similar to some of the remarks we made, I think that the most important thing to keep in mind is, as we look out over the next several years, we see a bigger and more stable premium marketplace in North America. The consumer trends are telling us that on many different dimensions folks leading a much more active lifestyle. The expansion in media, both social media and traditional media, coverage around sport and the energy around sport, and that\u2019s translating into a full price, healthy business, and sell-through in many dimensions of our business. As Trevor noted, the Air VaporMax is a shoe well above $150, $160, up into the $180, $190 range. And as we continue to release that product in different colorways with different iterations, the sell-through is extraordinary. And so we really look at the promotional environment in the near-term as a discontinuity. And the result of the consumer-led disruption more so than a trend or something systemic relative to athletic footwear and apparel. As I mentioned, we can\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not sure anybody could predict with complete precision what some of those discontinuities will be. But as Trevor noted, what we\u2019re really focused on is ensuring that we are not in that dynamic, the dynamic we\u2019re creating is tremendous brand impact and energy around sport. And again, as we\u2019ve all mentioned, you\u2019re going to see us bring some new innovation that again the Air VaporMax and other styles proof consumers love when you bring it even in an environment like this. So I do believe that that promotional marketplace will put some pressure on pricing and off-price in the short-term. But we definitely believe that that is a short-term impact. And that as we work as our retailers and our industry work through that and we help them work through that with new experiences and energy will be back to a full price led marketplace in the medium and long-term. Trevor Edwards : Yes, and just to maybe give a couple of finer points to there, Andy spoke about certainly the VaporMax and the Air platform how that continues to really hold its price. What we\u2019ve also understand is, we\u2019re going to continue to focus on our NIKE React, which is clearly a new technology that has great opportunity across all the categories, so you\u2019ll see us do that, and ZoomX, another example of technology. So what we\u2019re seeing is that, the consumer will pay for when they see sort of great value in the product and for us it\u2019s actually giving value through a great innovation. And so, we believe that is one of the, let\u2019s say, counterbalances to a marketplace that seems to head down to a more promotional aspect. So our task is to continue to give the consumer greater value. Trevor Edwards : And to leverage the demand that we created at the premium price points through innovation by taking that down into broader platform opportunities at the same time, and that\u2019s a big opportunity for Nike. Simeon Siegel : Can I just ask on that point, so given the savings this quarter about the demand creation, any thoughts on how that looks throughout the year? Mark Parker : Well, we certainly expect to continue to invest in the brand. I think, one of the greatest advantages we have is our brand. And it\u2019s not on our balance sheet, it\u2019s not in our P&L. What you do see in our P&L is the spending associated with creating energy around key sport moments, innovation launches. And I think, as Trevor noted, you will likely see a stark contrast from us, as compared to some of the dynamics in North America. And then internationally, again, where we have tremendous momentum, we\u2019ll continue to invest to fuel that growth and equity in our brand. Trevor Edwards : Yes. And obviously, you\u2019ve got great sporting events coming out. You\u2019ve also got the World Cup coming up in the back-end of the year. So, you can expect that consumers will absolutely feel the impact of our brand, as the balance \u2013 as we go through the balance of the year and beyond. Nitesh Sharan : Thank you, Simeon. I think, that\u2019s all the time we have today. Thank you all for joining us. We look forward to speaking to you again in another month at our Investor Day. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

In Q2 we delivered solid results, showing early progress against the long-term strategies we laid out in October. Let\u2019s look at the numbers for the quarter. NIKE, Inc.\u2019s second quarter revenues were up 5%, growing to $8.6 billion. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 3%. Gross margin was 43%, down 120 basis points to prior year, earnings per share was $0.46, down 8% to prior year and we delivered ROIC of 32%. While the athletic marketplace continues to shift, we\u2019re very confident in the factors of our business that we control. Though our Consumer -- through our Consumer Direct Offense, we\u2019re identifying which consumer opportunities have the most upside and we\u2019re over-indexing in those areas to fuel growth. As we outlined at Investor Day, we\u2019re focused on unleashing a relentless flow of innovation at a scale that our industry has never seen, bringing NIKE closer to the consumer in key cities and delivering with speed and using the power of digital to go deep and broad by rewarding our most active NIKE+ members, while expanding that community to hundreds of millions. We\u2019re entering the second half of the year with a wave of new products and concepts. Consumers want fresh, innovative product and they want choice, and right now, our innovation cycle is delivering against those demands. Let\u2019s start with the three distinct platforms in our running revolution. They cover the spectrum of runners and they\u2019re beginning to scale to create a significant commercial impact. NIKE React, for example, is just a few weeks away from being available for runners for the first time with the epic React. The early response to its combination of responsiveness and ride have been very positive. In a sport where every ounce matters, it\u2019s one of the lightest platforms we\u2019ve ever created and it\u2019s incredibly comfortable for people that want to wear it all day. As we move into summer, Nike React will quickly scale across all major price points on its way to being NIKE\u2019s next billion dollar performance platform. ZoomX has exceeded our expectations. I\u2019ve been a part of almost every major innovation at NIKE and I can confidently say the 4% is among the most significant performance advancements in our history and this summer, ZoomX will be even more accessible through our celebrated Pegasus with a new shoe called the PEG Turbo that will join the Zoom Pegasus 35. We\u2019re also introducing the iconic look and feel of ZoomX into lifestyle through Sportswear. This is NIKE at its best, delivering game-changing innovation for the athlete and bringing it to more people through new dimensions, including street and active wear. The diversification of VaporMax is also well underway. We\u2019ve introduced multiple silhouettes and added new material options at different price points. The energy is having a positive impact on our entire Air Max business. We\u2019ll carry that into March with one of the biggest brand investments in Air Max Day, where we celebrate with consumers around the world. This year we\u2019ll build excitement with new mash-ups and reissues like the Air Max 93 and the 98, along with the Air Max 270, a new lifestyle cushioning platform that will deliver at the key price point of $150. We know the running silhouette is connecting with consumers right now and over the next several seasons we feel very good about our complete Running offense across both performance and lifestyle. In basketball, we\u2019ve created a lot of opportunities for creative storytelling around the game\u2019s greatest athletes. In the next several weeks alone, we\u2019ll deliver the next version of the industry\u2019s biggest signature shoe with the KYRIE 4. We\u2019ll build on the incredible first year of Paul George\u2019s shoe with the PG2 and we\u2019ll introduce on an all-new Flyknit construction with Kobe\u2019s next performance design, and Jordan brand will launch its first signature shoe with reigning MVP Russell Westbrook. We\u2019re also thrilled to expand our relationship with Giannis Antetokounmpo as we bring his unique personality to life through new signature product and storytelling next year. In Apparel, we\u2019re leveraging our complete portfolio to realize its massive potential. This spring and summer, we\u2019ll push the edges in performance for the biggest sports moments like the NBA All-Star Game, the Tennis Majors and the World Cup 18. We\u2019re designing more focused commercial collections with women\u2019s core items and Sportswear, and we\u2019re shortening the product creation process to get everything to the consumer faster. We also have platforms that are going to take the industry in a completely new direction. We\u2019re bringing the energy we\u2019ve created through adaptive fit technology to more people through a broader collection across performance categories, as well as Sportswear. We know amazing innovation is fundamental to commanding full price and creating a healthy pull marketplace. With the most robust lineup we\u2019ve ever created, I am confident we have the foundation in place to fuel NIKE\u2019s next phase of long-term growth. As part of our Consumer Direct Offense, we continue to transform the way we operate to get closer to the consumer. Through 2X Direct and 2X Speed, we\u2019re testing and learning, then sharing and scaling throughout our key cities. I was just in Europe and there was incredible excitement for what we\u2019re bringing to the consumer. We\u2019re creating differentiation in one of the more complex and competitive marketplaces by taking control of our brand and storytelling across more channels, while elevating consumer services. For example, across EMEA, we\u2019re taking friction out of the delivery and return process. In Berlin, we offer same day delivery, leveraging inventory within the city with Paris and London following this summer. In Shanghai, we\u2019ve built a digital studio that will focus on creative selling opportunities and more fully leveraging real-time data with platforms like WeChat and Tmall. And in North America, we\u2019re leveraging the Express Lane to sharpen our position in key markets. In New York, we\u2019ve set up market design teams to create hyperlocal apparel for Nike Soho and early next month we\u2019ll deliver the Nike Shox Gravity that was created in a greatly condensed time line. Through our focused investments we\u2019re adding new capabilities and tremendous energy to the markets that matter the most. One of the biggest drivers of that plan is, of course, our strategic shift to digital. It\u2019s how we get to know and reward members with what they want and that includes investments in personalization that leverage machine learning to curate assortments to match individual member preferences. For example, the Nike+ apps Reserved For You service is converting sales at a rate that\u2019s 40 times greater than traditional outreach. That\u2019s a tremendous return on investment. And what\u2019s exciting is that our apps have yet to arrive in all of our key markets. We launched the sneaker app in China earlier this month and later this fiscal year we\u2019ll go live in Japan for some of the world\u2019s most obsessed sneaker fans. Membership is opening up opportunities for new digital service partnerships as well. Next quarter our Nike+ personalized benefits will include special offers from service like Apple Music, Class Pass, Headspace and more to come. And on the commerce side, our digital footprint continues to scale to hundreds of millions through new partnerships. Our strategy is to partner with platforms that advance our brand, as well as our business through presentation, pricing and consumer data to support our membership efforts. Zalando and Tmall are great examples of partners who actively engage and we\u2019re scaling those learnings to other platforms. This spring in the U.S., we\u2019ll run a pilot with Stitch Fix, the online personal styling service to bring personalized women\u2019s product to their expansive audience and we\u2019re extending our pilot with Amazon. It\u2019s going well and we remain focused on learning and elevating the consumer experience. Another key piece of our digital strategy is to continue to advance the role that product plays in unlocking experiences. You know about our first step with the NBA Connected Jersey and next year we\u2019ll introduce the Nike Connected in the Air Force 1. We see massive potential in a future where more NIKE products are connected, bringing consumers inspirational content and serving as the onramp for NIKE membership. And you can envision where that future goes, where consumers seamlessly engage with us through digitally connected products that continue to inform our design, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, creating new growth opportunities across each of our Triple Double pillars. It should be clear that NIKE is actively driving change in our business and throughout our industry. We\u2019re partnering, experimenting and we\u2019re fast tracking our greatest opportunities. We\u2019re off to a good start and we see a long runway of growth ahead. Thanks and now here\u2019s Trevor. Trevor Edwards : Thank you, Mark. Happy holidays, everyone. Let\u2019s get right to the results. As always, my comments are on a constant currency basis. For the quarter, NIKE Brand\u2019s revenue grew 4% and revenue for Nike Direct was up 15%, driven by online growth of 29%, comp store growth of 6% and new stores. Mark mentioned how we are identifying our biggest opportunities through our Consumer Direct Offense. We invest in these opportunities through a focused growth agenda, with a focus on 12 key cities, shaping 10 key countries in service of our consumers. It is through the execution of the category offense that we drive brand heat and distinction, which in turn leads to growth in the marketplace. Mark spoke about the great progress we have made in innovation, speed and digital, and at our Investor meeting in October, we discussed how we drive brand heat. In Q2, we created new brand energy and strong demand around the world. From red hot product launches like the Air VaporMax to powerful collaborations like The Ten with Virgil Abloh to creating completely new ways to engage such as the new Nike+ Unlocks, our latest membership service. When we create distinction for our brand and show up authentically, the consumer responds. That brand heat makes us even more confident that we will see continued international strength and underlying improvement in our domestic business, more on that later. Now to the category offense, we create brand and product concepts that generate heat. So let\u2019s review some of the categories where our deeper consumer connections came to life in Q2 starting with basketball. Nike Basketball grew strong double digits in Q2, as we energized basketball culture globally through performance and style. Our new NBA partnership is already energizing our Apparel business, feeding innovation and growth. Both the NBA connected jersey and the showtime hoodie are generating strong demand in the marketplace through our Nike Direct channels and through partners like Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods. In footwear, consumers continued to respond to our deep roster of styles across the spectrum of performance and lifestyle. Of note was the consumer\u2019s phenomenal response to the Lebron 15 making it one of the quarter\u2019s highlights. And the KYRIE 3 which continued to be the number one selling shoe in the market is being fueled by using incredible season and is growing global popularity. We will soon release a second version of Kyrie signature shoe at the $80 price point and we continue to see strong sell-through with the PG 1 and the KD 10. Next the Jordan Brand, our key launches in Q2 proved yet again that the Jordan Brand is a powerful force starting with the great results we saw from the AJ 32 and the AJ 11. When we connect the right product with the strength of the Jordan storytelling, the results are incredible. For instance, the Air Jordan 1 was the most coveted product in The Ten collection, cementing its position as 2017\u2019s Shoe of the Year. We also want to keep Jordan icons coveted and special, which is why we are proactively managing the exclusivity of specific iconic styles and color ways in North America. At the same time, we accelerated into new dimensions for the Jordan Brand across performance and lifestyle. In fact, we\u2019re already seeing momentum in the areas where we are dimensionalizing the brands from International to Apparel to Women\u2019s, where we\u2019re bringing new styles just for her. For example, this quarter, the Jordan\u2019s Women\u2019s business saw success with the Air S11, a shoe designed specifically for women, which sold out quickly across the marketplace. Overall, the strength and breadth of the Jordan Brand continues to expand. It\u2019s clear in the excitements we see from consumers of all ages, when Jordan partners with colleges, as we saw in Q2 with the universities of Florida and Oklahoma coming onboard, bringing new consumers into the Jordan Brand. Ultimately, growth in Jordan will be driven by further dimensionalizing Jordan\u2019s iconic sneakers and the overall brand to create new growth opportunities, and we are activating against these new dimensions now and into the future. In Running, we are seeing brand heat through the running revolution that Mark mentioned. The performance story of Q2 was the incredible impact of the Zoom Vaporfly 4% and the impact it had in the marketplace, as it dominated the podium at the top six marathons this fall. The energy around the Vaporfly 4% and the ZoomX cushioning has a real impact on the rest of our Running business. It shows how truly breakthrough performance product drives distinction and creates demand in the market. Next our Women\u2019s business, which offers a huge opportunity as we deliver with more focus both on sport and style in our unified women\u2019s line. We continued to evolve and invest in our Women\u2019s business from concept-to-consumers, with increased resources focused on serving her in the right way. And as always, it starts with innovation. We\u2019re driving that new innovation in the most important areas of our workout, from bras to pants to tights. Whilst we are already the number one brand for performance bras globally, we expect to quadruple this business over the next five years. We\u2019re also number one globally in pants and tights, and we see more growth ahead as we introduce new styles across statement and core. Last month, we launched our new Nike Pants Studio on nike.com and at thousands of doors worldwide. The Studio launched with new and updated workout tights and pants, providing more choice in materials, finishes and lengths driving stronger in-season sell-thorough. And we\u2019re also focusing on the massive untapped opportunity in women\u2019s footwear. Consumers are responding to the rich storytelling and the great product offerings at the Nike Sneaker Boutiques led by the Air VaporMax, the Air Max 97 and our Force is Female Air Force 1 collection. We\u2019ve been rolling these out across the marketplace with our partners like Nordstrom\u2019s. Ultimately, NIKE is the only brand that can bring all this together, footwear, apparel and deep storytelling to serve her complete active lifestyle. Lastly, our momentum in Sportswear continued with another quarter of double-digit growth. Our Sportswear apparel continued to lead the market with strong consumer response to our Tech Fleece and our Basketball off-court apparel. At the same time, our high heat collaborations, like the celebration of the 35th Anniversary of the Air Force 1, fueled momentum in their key cities and across the marketplace. In Q2, our power franchises strategy helped Air Max 97, one of the hottest sneakers in 2017. First, we launched the -- we re-launched the icon with limited pairs at the Milan Fashion Week last year, before growing it to where it stands today close to a million pairs each season. It is this kind of energy, thanks to the right strategies and the power of the right product that continues to fuel growth in our categories. Now let\u2019s discuss our geographies, where the Consumer Direct Offense offers strategic focus on how we drive brand heat and shape differentiated retail in our key cities. In Greater China, we delivered strong double-digit growth, as we continued to extend our leadership position. We\u2019re seeing great sell-through across our power franchises from the VaporMax to the LeBron 15 to the Air Force 1 and the Jordan 1. While our growth in China is being led through digital across both nike.com and Tmall, we are also driving very strong comp store results. In fact, our overall Greater China direct business was up over 30% in Q2. This quarter we also had Singles Day, which offered even more proof of our growth strategy. On the biggest shopping day in the fastest growing geography, we set records as NIKE emerged as the number one overall brand for both footwear and apparel. Throughout China, we see sports transcending and driving culture. For example, this quarter when we organized the Shanghai Marathon, which we have for the last six years, we had a record of 120,000 people sign up to fill 38,000 available spots. This growth and the opportunities in front of us keep us very excited about the results we see in Greater China. On EMEA -- on our EMEA geography had a great quarter, growing double digits as we took share across the marketplace, fueled by very strong digital and comp store growth. Our latest door openings in EMEA with our JV partners are seeing excellent results as we implement new capabilities such as inventory integration and a membership pilot to improve the consumer experience. In Q2, we also piloted shoppable Instagram stories and our success there, as well as our success with Zalando and ASOS gives us incredible confidence in our digital commerce momentum going forward in EMEA and around the world. Finally, there\u2019s North America, where our strategies are starting to pay off as we reignite the U.S. marketplace. This quarter, we upgraded the nike.com and app experience with better search functionality, improved product presentation and faster checkout. At the same time, our Nike+ membership program is already showing good results, including a significant uptick in new and buying members. Members also now have personal access to an expert advice and recommendations through the NIKE app. All told, this improved consumer experience has led to increased engagement and overall conversion. To be clear, we are aggressively making great progress, building in scale in NIKE consumer experiences throughout our Nike Direct Retail. In addition, we are actively working with our key retail partners to help them transform the consumer experience as we accelerate the shift toward differentiated retail. One example is the new Finish Line flagship door in LA featuring a virtual product wall that lets consumers dive deep on innovation and storytelling. And our Sneakeasy pop-up in New York with Foot Locker delivered our best products in an environment targeting members with tailored experiences. These consumers\u2019 experiences create strong energy across the marketplace and the initial consumer response has been very positive. So as we execute against our Consumer Direct Offense in United States, we\u2019re creating a healthier market as we manage supply tightly to demand, as we deliver stronger full price sell through with new innovation and drive brand heat, and most importantly, make the investments that fuel long-term growth. In the end, all over the globe, we\u2019re seeing exciting successes in our greatest growth opportunities. But it\u2019s the momentum we\u2019re continuing to build that gives us tremendous confidence in the year ahead. Thanks. Now here\u2019s Andy. Andy Campion : Thanks, Mark and Trevor, and happy holidays, everyone. As we said at our Investor Day in October, we are operating in a dynamic environment on multiple dimensions, ranging from geopolitical volatility to the evolving retail landscape here in the U.S., to rapidly shifting consumer expectations around the world. In dynamic times such as these, some will try to do everything they possibly can to change their circumstances in the short-term. But at NIKE, we know that in times like these, you don\u2019t need to do everything, you need to do the right things and the right things are a function of what matters most to our consumers. Our new strategy the Consumer Direct Offense reflects our focus on what matters most to the consumers that we serve around the world, with an emphasis on our top 12 cities and 10 key countries. They are telling us and in fact showing us with their actions, that they want new, innovative products faster and through a more direct connection to NIKE leveraging digital. In Q2 our financial performance exceeded the expectations that we had set 90 days ago, from the topline to the bottomline. But more importantly, our results were amplified by our focus on what matters most. As Mark and Trevor detailed, the launch of new innovative products drove brand heat and strong consumer demand. New versions of the Air VaporMax propelled it to the top selling running shoe globally over $100 and sparked demand for other icons within the Nike Air portfolio. The Zoom Vaporfly 4% propelled runners to the top of the podium at the biggest marathons and it continues to sell out immediately as we bring new supply to the market. And as Trevor mentioned, we saw incredible demand for the Virgil Abloh collaboration with respect to 10 of NIKE\u2019s most iconic styles, ranging from the Jordan 1 to the Air Force 1, to the Presto to the Blazer and beyond. All of these launches of new innovative products in Q2 were met with extraordinary demand, expanding and creating new energy within NIKE\u2019s unrivaled portfolio of power franchises. In Q2, we also saw increasing and enhanced service of our consumers more directly through digital. Once again, growth through nike.com and our strategic digital partnerships outpaced growth in all other dimensions of the marketplace. Nike.com growth was catalyzed by our re-launch of the Nike+ membership program in November, with growth in Nike+ members and buying members both accelerating. And it\u2019s important to remember that our new offense is not only reigniting momentum in the U.S. marketplace, innovation and digital are also fueling double-digit growth in aggregate across our international geographies. Our international businesses now represent over 55% of our revenues and as we shared at our Investor Day, we projected that they will contribute 75% of our incremental growth over the next five years. While our focus on innovation, speed and digital helped deliver solid results in Q2, we\u2019re even more excited about what we will bring to market in the second half of fiscal year \u201818. Over the next several months, NIKE will launch and scale more innovation than in any other time in our history. We will dimensionalize the Air VaporMax platform, expand the ZoomX platform, launch the Nike React and Air Max 270 platforms and reintroduce Nike Shox. The second half of fiscal year \u201818 will showcase NIKE\u2019s unrivaled ability to deliver performance and sports style innovation at scale, and we will also continue to enhance our digital commerce offerings globally, serving consumers and increasingly engaging in frictionless ways. While our nuance is first and foremost a growth strategy, innovation, speed and digital will also drive expanding profitability and returns on invested capital. As we exit this fiscal year and put FX headwinds behind us, the impact of the Triple Double on margin will become even more evident. By scaling innovation, we are enhancing the price-value relationship in an otherwise promotional environment. By leveraging digital to better sense and serve consumer demand, we are becoming a better retailer and beginning to drive stronger full price versus off-price sell-through. Suffice it to say that we are accelerating execution against this strategy that is fueling stronger growth and a return to expanding profitability. But before I go deeper into our outlook, let\u2019s reflect on our second quarter results in a bit more detail. Q2 reported revenue grew 5%, as international growth in the low teens was partially offset by an expected decline in North America wholesale revenue. Second quarter diluted EPS contracted 8% versus the prior year to $0.46, as revenue growth and a lower effective tax rate were offset by gross margin contraction and higher SG&A. Gross margin contracted 120 basis points in Q2, as higher average selling prices were offset primarily by foreign exchange and to a lesser extent, higher average product costs. Total SG&A was up 10% in Q2, due primarily to a 15% increase in demand creation investments and that increase in demand creation was primarily driven by sports marketing, our new partnership with the NBA and the launch of new digital and physical retail experiences in key cities. Operating overhead increased 8%, driven primarily by investments in our Nike Direct businesses. The effective tax rate was 12.7% in Q2, compared to 24.4% for the same period last year, reflecting the tax benefit of stock-based compensation in the current period under the new accounting standard, as well as an increase in the mix of earnings from operations outside the U.S., which are generally subject to a lower tax rate. As of November 30th, inventories were up 6%, driven by changes in foreign exchange rates and to a lesser extent, an increase in NIKE Brand units. So now let\u2019s turn to the financial performance for a few of our key operating segments. In the second quarter, North America revenue contracted 5%, on both a reported and currency-neutral basis. While the marketplace continues to evolve and remains promotional in the short-term, we see momentum and a pull market building beneath the surface of our aggregated results. Growth in our Nike Direct business continues to outpace growth in the consolidating wholesale marketplace. Looking ahead, we see Nike Direct growth accelerating and the broader marketplace beginning to stabilize as partners like Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and Foot Locker transform their consumer experiences. As such, we anticipate significantly less contraction in the second half of fiscal year \u201818, as compared to the first half. In line with the timing of new product launches, coming to market late in Q3 and scaling over the course of Q4, we are positioning the North America marketplace for a return to sustainable profitable growth. For the quarter, EBIT was down 14% versus the prior year, driven by investments in SG&A, including the launch of our new partnerships with the NBA and our re-launch of the Nike+ membership program. Next let\u2019s turn to EMEA, where we continue to have strong momentum. In Q2, revenue in EMEA was up 14% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by double-digit growth across footwear and apparel, as well as most categories and territories. Our growth was led by Nike Direct, digital momentum, as well as double-digit comp store growth. On a reported basis, revenue increased 19% and EBIT grew 8%, as strong revenue growth in SG&A leverage were partially offset by lower gross margin, with gross margin contraction, primarily driven by transactional FX headwinds. In Greater China, revenue in Q2 was up 15% on a currency-neutral basis, with strong double-digit growth across footwear and apparel in most categories and led by Nike Direct. Digital momentum in the quarter was fueled by nike.com and our partnership with Tmall, with both being amplified by a record shattering Singles Day for the NIKE Brand. We continue to see tremendous growth potential over the long-term in China, but we\u2019re not taking that for granted. We will continue to invest in China to ensure that we can exceed consumer expectations and extend our leadership. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue grew 16%, while EBIT was up 1%, due to lower margins in Nike Direct, significant transactional FX headwinds and higher SG&A. Moving to APLA, a dynamic, globally diverse geography fueled by key cities including Tokyo, Seoul and Mexico City. In Q2, revenue in APLA grew 8% on currency-neutral basis, driven by strong double-digit growth in Nike Direct, Sportswear and Basketball, and balanced growth across footwear and apparel. We are the leading brand in the key cities and countries across this geography, and we\u2019re increasingly capturing the strong demand for our brand through the expansion of our digitally ecosystem of apps, as well as strategic partnerships with innovative digital retailers. On a reported basis, Q2 revenue in APLA was up 6% and EBIT grew 9%, driven by revenue growth and SG&A leverage. And finally, at Converse, Q2 revenue declined 4% on a currency-neutral basis, as international growth was more than offset by a decline in North America. On a reported basis, Converse revenue declined 2% and EBIT was down 38%, due to gross margin contraction and demand creation investment to drive brand heat and reignite growth in the North America market. I\u2019ll now move to our outlook for the balance of the year. Our full year guidance for fiscal year \u201818 remains consistent with the guidance that we provided 90 days ago. We are targeting revenue, gross margin and SG&A, all, within the ranges we previously communicated. We are building momentum in the second half both in the U.S. and internationally as we execute our new offense. However, there are some anomalies by quarter. So, with that, the following is more specific guidance. For the full year, we continued to expect reported revenue growth in the mid single-digit range. In Q3 in particular, we expect reported revenue growth at or slightly below the rate of reported revenue growth that we delivered in Q2, with the timing of new product launches coming later in the quarter. As for gross margin, for the full year, we continued to expect contraction of 50 basis points to as much as 100 basis points. We are seeing improvement in the underlying drivers of gross margin expansion. That said, there are two factors that will weigh on our Q3 margin. First, FX remains a material headwind in Q3, but eases in Q4. Second, we will remain measured with respect to our targeted margin in Q3, based on the continued promotional environment across the broader U.S. retail landscape. Thus for Q3 we expect gross margin to contract by 125 to 175 basis points, followed by significant sequential improvement in gross margin in Q4. As for SG&A, we continued to expect full year growth in the mid-single digits. While we remain disciplined in our spending, we are also identifying opportunities to accelerate investment that will fuel growth. For example, we see opportunities within demand creation to drive brand distinct and heat and within operating overhead to elevate our digital capabilities. Accordingly, we expect low double-digit SG&A growth in Q3. We expect other income and expense net of interest expense to be approximately $30 million to $40 million of expense in Q3 and roughly $120 million of expense for the full year. Finally, we now expect our effective tax rate to be between approximately 14% to 16% for the full year before taking into account U.S. Tax Reform. Note that assuming U.S. Tax Reform is enacted into law, our tax rate would be significantly higher in Q3, driven primarily by the one-time taxes on deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. That said, we expect U.S. Tax Reform will have a net favorable impact on NIKE, taking into account the impact on taxes, access to capital and capacity to invest across our value chain. Assuming enactment, we will update you with more specifics next quarter. As we look ahead to the second half of the fiscal year and into fiscal year \u201819, we have an unprecedented wave of new innovative products coming to market. We have strong international momentum and we are building underlying momentum and a pull market in the U.S. Our current momentum is the direct result of our focus on what matters most to consumers. Accordingly, we are increasingly confident that our new offense will ignite NIKE\u2019s next horizon of strong, sustainable, profitable growth. With that, we\u2019ll now open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : Thank you. Great quarter. I really appreciate all the information. There\u2019s a lot there to chew on. Andy, there was a couple comments you made. I wanted to see if I could get you to elaborate on. I think one you said something along the lines of scaling digital to leverage the price value relationship. Are you talking about ASP increases over time, is that -- are you thinking along those lines early in the customer advertising curve, is that something that you guys are prepared to start thinking about again? Andy Campion : Yeah. Happy holidays, Omar. There are couple things we\u2019re scaling there and enhancing the price value relationship. One being innovation. As I referenced, we all know it\u2019s a relatively promotional environment, particularly in the U.S., but even within that environment as we\u2019re launching innovation. At the higher end of the price spectrum, we\u2019re seeing sellouts and incredibly strong demand, and obviously, we have always seen that as an opportunity to expand the entire spectrum of product offerings across price points as we cascade innovation across styles, categories and price points. To your question on digital, we also see digital being opportunity to expand the price value relationship, as well as full price sell-through. So on the first point, we\u2019ve spoken about Editing to Amplify. Digital is where we\u2019re probably doing that most significantly. So editing down our line or our assortment to the products that we know consumers matter -- the products we know consumers love most. Great example we\u2019ve shared in the past would be the Air Force 1 and giving them fewer styles, but better choice and dimension within that and we are seeing strong demand when consumers get what they really want, they\u2019re willing to pay that full price and they\u2019re willing to pay increasing prices as we bring innovative products and new styles. And then we\u2019re also seeing the opportunity as we move forward, as we build new capabilities that leverage demand signals that we get from consumers in terms of how often they buy, what they buy to improve full price versus off price sell-through. Omar Saad : Thank you. Happy holidays, everyone. Mark Parker : Thanks, Omar. Andy Campion : Thanks, Omar. Trevor Edwards : Thanks, Omar. Nitesh Sharan : Operator, we will take the next question, please. Operator : Your next question is from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim. Bob Drbul : Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Mark, you mentioned, the Amazon pilot is going well and your partnership will be expanded. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about what you\u2019re pleased with so far and what we should be looking for in coming months from Amazon? Mark Parker : Sure. First of all, as I said, the pilot has gone well. We\u2019ve seen good sell-through on the limited selection of products that we have offered. We are extending the small pilot that we\u2019ve got, as I mentioned, we know, I think, when this operates at the highest level that there\u2019s a great opportunity between NIKE and Amazon to serve the consumer in ways that are mutually beneficial to both Amazon and NIKE. So we are extending the pilot. We were bullish on where this can go from here. It\u2019s -- I think the important part is that we advance the brand through better presentation and then the sharing of data, yeah, so we can better serve consumers. I think that\u2019s really what we\u2019re driving for behind the Amazon relationship. And frankly, any digital platform relationship we have. Tmall, I think, in China, we pointed that out. That\u2019s a great example. I met recently with Alibaba\u2019s CEO, Daniel Zhang, a few weeks ago and we\u2019re incorporating our brands on their platforms in ways that benefit both companies, and I think that\u2019s, again, that\u2019s the real opportunity we see with Amazon, as well as we move forward. We\u2019re learning a lot and we\u2019re bullish on our ability to extend that relationship, and continue to grow. Nitesh Sharan : All right\u2026 Bob Drbul : Got it. I just have a follow-up question for you. On the NFL partnership, you guys have a vote on the competition committee with your partnership and do you have an opinion on the [Technical Difficulty] (45:51)? Andy Campion : Hey, Bob. Sorry, we cut -- I think you cut out there at the end. I caught the NFL part, but that was about it. Bob Drbul : I was wondering if you had an opinion on the tax rule. If you\u2019re on the -- do you have a competition committee vote and whether or not Jesse James made that catch last Sunday night, do you have anything? Mark Parker : Okay. We don\u2019t have a vote. Trevor Edwards : No vote. Mark Parker : No vote. But I am waiting\u2026 Bob Drbul : Happy holidays, guys. Trevor Edwards : Yeah. Mark Parker : Happy holidays. Trevor Edwards : Thanks, Bob. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Kate McShane with Citi. Kate McShane : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Andy, in your prepared comments, I didn\u2019t hear you flag closeout or promotions as a reason for the decline in margin this quarter. So I just wondered if you could quantify that for us and what is your view of the inventory level in the marketplace right now, and is there any differentiation between footwear versus apparel inventories? Andy Campion : Yeah. One of the reasons we didn\u2019t speak about closeout as a driver of margin contraction is that it was not very significant. Almost all of our margin contraction in the quarter was driven by foreign exchange. As you know, we have said time and time again over the last several quarters that what we\u2019re most focused on was tightening supply and lining it up with demand to create a pull market and we feel great about the progress we\u2019ve made there. Overall across the world, we believe our inventories are relatively healthy -- healthier and improving. We still have room for improvement and so we are keeping a close eye on it. And there are discrete pockets, but there is no dimension of inventory that we would call out as risk factor or an item of concern at this point. Kate McShane : Okay. So closeouts in terms of your guidance for Q3, the guidance that you just gave for Q3, are they expected to tick up, because of what they\u2019re comping against or should it be a similar dynamic in Q3 as what we saw in Q2? Andy Campion : No. Actually, there are a couple of factors in Q3. One, FX remains a bit of a headwind, more than a bit, a headwind at about the same level and I spoke to some extent about that. There is another dimension within our margin that I\u2019ll call out. As we launch greater volume and scale of new and innovative products, our tooling and other upfront product costs associated with new styles is amortized in the first season of launch, and that is having a bit of an impact in the second half of the year. In a sense, it\u2019s one of those things you all might often refer to as a weakness that\u2019s really a strength. It is a discrete anomaly within the first season of launch, but it\u2019s really the benefit of this wave of innovation that we\u2019re bringing to market. And so, as we go forward, those products have a very favorable impact on price value and margin. It\u2019s just that this pretty significant shift up in mix of new innovative products in this second half of the fiscal year versus last year is having a little bit of an impact, particularly in Q3. Nitesh Sharan : Thanks, Kate. Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please. Operator : The next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Good afternoon. Mark Parker : Hi, Paul. Paul Trussell : Very strong performance out of the international segments, so congratulations on that, but I do want to better understand the dynamics of the North American market. In particular, if you can just discuss what you\u2019re seeing from a demand standpoint and how you are changing supply into the marketplace and is the commentary regarding anticipating significantly less contraction in second half primary related -- primarily related to the timing of product launches? Thanks. Mark Parker : Yeah. Let me start with North America, your question. First of all, we continue to see as we all do the shift, consumer shift toward digital, and obviously, that\u2019s why we\u2019re over-indexing in that area. In the near-term, as Andy had mentioned, we expect that there\u2019s going be a promotional backdrop and some continued retail consolidation in the North American market. Despite that, and I think, Andy, touched on this as well, there is a real consumer appetite for innovation and new retail experiences, and that has us very excited, particularly as you look at what\u2019s coming in the second half of this fiscal year, particularly ramping up in Q4. Many of the new product innovations that we have and the platforms that I think are very leveraged -- highly leverageable, really ramp up in the Q4 period of the second half. So and the consumer, there is an appetite for premium product and new innovation, and we see that driving full price, and again, a real pull market for us, which is really what we\u2019re driving for in North America especially. So we also have membership. We\u2019re connecting through membership. We\u2019ve seen really strong results as we build our membership base. And then speed, we talked ability our ability to move and our focus on moving closer to market. We know that that\u2019s also a major factor in driving full price demand with the consumer. So, I guess, I would say that disruption really is what\u2019s creating opportunity. So we\u2019re investing in a sustainable platform in North America for long-term growth and we see that wave of growth coming for NIKE in the U.S., building into Q4 and then moving through fiscal \u201819. Andy, do you want to? Andy Campion : Yeah. In short you\u2019re right. I did mention that we did see significantly less contraction in the second half of fiscal year \u201818 than with the first half. The -- what\u2019s beneath the surface of our results is we\u2019re building momentum and we\u2019re seeing -- we are going to see that momentum build monthly over the second half, particularly as we start to launch some of these products late in Q3 and then scale them in Q4. We obviously don\u2019t plan the business on a fiscal quarter basis. We plan it on consumer time lines and we\u2019ve got some pretty impactful consumer moments coming up and product launches. And so just to reiterate with what Mark said, we see accelerating growth in our Nike Direct businesses. We see the early stages of stabilization in a consolidating, but more importantly, transforming wholesale marketplace and that\u2019s really positioning us well for growth as we exit fiscal year \u201818 and from fiscal year \u201819 forward. Paul Trussell : Thanks for the color. Best of luck and happy holidays. Nitesh Sharan : Thanks, Paul. Same to you. Mark Parker : Thanks. Nitesh Sharan : Operator, we\u2019ll take the next question, please. Operator : The next question is from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Jim Duffy, your line is open. Jim Duffy : Oh! Hi, everyone. Happy holidays. Thanks for taking my question. Mark Parker : Hey, Jim. Andy Campion : Hey, Jim. Jim Duffy : Very encouraged by the comments about the anticipated inflection in North America into fiscal \u201819, with respect to focused wholesale distribution resources in North America, I am curious where you are in the process of communicating that to channel partners. Specifically, what\u2019s been the message to those deemed not strategic on a go-forward basis and how are you navigating those kind of delicate communications? Mark Parker : Yeah. I\u2019ll start on that, Jim, and happy holidays, by the way. Jim Duffy : Thank you. Mark Parker : As you know and you\u2019ve followed us for a while. We don\u2019t disclose the specifics of our partner investment or trade terms publicly. That being said, one of the reasons is, because it depends on the partner. And what you highlighted is great to mention on what that means in particular right now, which is, where we\u2019re really focused on investing is with those most strategic partners who want to move fast, test and learn with was and prove out the financial benefits of more direct, differentiated retail, with higher levels of service, and that connect the NIKE Brand more closely to the consumer leveraging digital. And to your point, we are shifting investment or funding from more undifferentiated dimensions of wholesale toward those partners that share our vision and both Mark and Trevor discussed some of the examples that we are currently testing and implementing with partners. And we\u2019re seeing great results early on from those experiences that are better serving consumers and giving them more of what they want, leveraging digital and in a more personally-oriented service environment. And so it will be a shift, but we are deep into those discussions, and in fact, we are investing with our partners already in that regard. Trevor Edwards : Yeah. And what I\u2019ll just add is that, and Andy kind of touched on it. The thing that really grounds us in that discussion is really the consumer. At the end of the day, the shift of the consumer moving to what we describe as differentiated retail is a call for them saying that they actually want to be better served, and we see that digitally and we also see that physically. So that\u2019s the conversations that we have and that\u2019s why when we see the work that we\u2019re doing, when we test, learn and scale with the partners, that actually see that, that\u2019s where the conversations have been really pretty straightforward, which is the consumer ultimately decides. Our job is to create even better experiences. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been working on. So a lot of the things that we touched on in the prepared remarks, whether it was the Sneakeasy concept or it was the work that we\u2019ve done with Finish Line or JVs in Europe. They are great examples of how we\u2019re better serving the consumer, and as a result, those dimensions are actually driving some more significant margin and better profitability. So that\u2019s the reason why we -- the conversations are usually pretty straightforward. Jim Duffy : Very good. My next question is on consumer shift. The pendulum seems to be swinging from casual lifestyle back towards performance. Mark or Trevor, I am curious to what extent you guys think this is serendipitous or cyclical versus simply consumers responding to a more compelling product offering in the marketplace? Mark Parker : Well, I think it\u2019s more B than A. The consumer shift, I don\u2019t think these are cycles as much as a response to specific products and compelling stories behind those products. We find that the esthetic of the product is absolutely essential no matter if it\u2019s performance or sports style. We are, as you know, the largest lifestyle business in the industry with, I think, we\u2019re at $8.5 billion in revenue in fiscal \u201817 and in Q2, our Sportswear business was the largest in our history as a company, and that was driven by both footwear and apparel. That said, the appetite for pure performance product is incredibly high. It also drives opportunity in Sportswear. So there\u2019s a symbiotic relationship between performance and Sportswear that we are very focused on creating and leveraging. That\u2019s really what sets NIKE apart I think in the end is our ability to take performance insights to drive unique product designs that we can then leverage for everyday lifestyle. And I feel really good about where we are right now as far as that\u2019s concerned, and then as we look at the new platforms and products that we have coming Q3 and ramping up in Q4, I think, we\u2019ll even be in a better position. Mark Parker : Thank you, Jim. Jim Duffy : Thank you. Nitesh Sharan : Operator, we\u2019ll take one last question, please. Operator : The last question is from Jonathan Komp with Robert W. Baird. Jonathan Komp : Yeah. Hi. Thank you. I want to actually ask about the strength on the direct side of the business. I think Trevor mentioned it accelerated and it was broad-based across nike.com and the same store sales globally. So any more color on where you\u2019re seeing the strength globally across geographic segments and any more detail on the color would -- on the drivers would be great? Mark Parker : Yeah. Hi, Jonathan. Happy holidays. I\u2019ll start on that. It\u2019s broad-based. We\u2019re seeing growth in nike.com in every geography and outpacing growth in almost every other dimension in every geography. In particular, where we really see the strongest dimensions of growth are in the key cities and key countries where we\u2019re really focusing execution of our offense. And that go a little even more narrow than that is Nike+ membership. We re-launched that in November. I would say the strongest rates of growth within digital were in the number of new members we got in the month of November alone, in the number of big members in November alone and what\u2019s great is we were really closely tracking what types of offerings the member unlocks and other services were resonating with them most. Trevor Edwards : Yeah. And I\u2019ll just add that one of the things that we did talk about is, we\u2019re clearly seeing the consumer shift to digital commerce and buying stronger online, as well as buying through the app. So one of the things that we have done and which, I think, is helping to fuel that growth is certainly as we rolled out the sneakers app in Europe, as well as in seven of the 10 key cities or key markets in Europe, we actually, it will go into Japan at the back end of this year. So we\u2019re really excited. International business is again exceptionally strong and we see just continued growth rates. Also, we are also seeing strong growth with our partners like Tmall and Zalando and ASOS. All of those are really key drivers also in terms of how they\u2019re actually working with us. So the fact that we\u2019re on their platforms, we\u2019re working with them very closely and we\u2019re certainly seeing them be able to grow in particular segments, whether those are premium segments or those are specific category segments. Jonathan Komp : Okay. Great. And then, I just wanted to follow-up with a question on the mix of growth overall international versus North America. And I think, Andy, you highlighted the Analyst Day guidance for the next five years at 75% of the growth will come outside of North America. And I am just wondering how to think about when you\u2019re expecting the shift to start to meet that metrics of growth. So starting in 2019, do you see that mix of growth starting to play out or it\u2019s about three quarters of international and North America returns to growth or how soon do you think\u2026 Andy Campion : Yeah. Jonathan Komp : \u2026 that\u2019s the right way to think about it? Andy Campion : Yeah. From a growth perspective, one of the things that we are feeling great about and increasingly confident in, based on the success we were seeing in Q2 with the execution of our new strategy, lines up with what we communicated at Investor Day. We said at Investor Day we see North America being a mid single-digit revenue growth geography, we said we see Europe being mid-single digits to high-single digits, Greater China in the low to mid-teens and APLA in the high-single digits to low-double digits. And as you\u2019re seeing this year, we are -- we have actually greater momentum than that in our international markets. And while we not at that current -- at that rate of growth in North America currently, the underlying momentum we\u2019re building and the -- and that we see ramping in Q4 and then positioning us for fiscal year \u201819, we think gets us back close to that targeted range in North America. So I\u2019ll tell you that\u2019s one of the things we\u2019re most excited about in North America. While we talked about less contraction in the second half, it\u2019s really about the momentum that we see building as we get to fiscal year \u201819 and being more in line with that long-term growth algorithm that we shared at our Investor Day. Trevor Edwards : And as we look forward too, we say that it\u2019s never linear, right. So a huge part of that comes down to, in North America, we will continue to help transform that marketplace with the work that we\u2019re doing with the consumer experiences. So we think that that will clearly have impacted, whilst at the same time, we\u2019re obviously driving the digital business. So, we believe that, to Andy\u2019s point, it will over time look in that way, but it won\u2019t necessarily go just quarter-by-quarter. Mark Parker : Thank you, Jon. That\u2019s all the time we have for today. Thank you all for joining us. Happy holidays and we\u2019ll speak with you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

So we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event, you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker. Mark Parker : Thanks Nitesh and good afternoon everyone. I'd first like to acknowledge the changes we made last week to further evolve our culture and restructure our leadership. We became aware of some behavioral issues that are inconsistent with Nike's values of inclusivity, respect and empowerment. I'm committed to ensure that we have an environment where every Nike employee can have a positive experience and reach their full potential. As you know, I publicly committed to serve as Chairman, President and CEO of NIKE, Inc. beyond 2020. Trevor Edwards and I both agreed to a change in leadership structure in the Nike brand at this time. As we transition to our next phase of growth and continue to evolve our culture, Trevor will work with me as an advisor through this transition until he retires in August. And I'd like to thank him for his important and significant contributions in growing and strengthening the Nike brand around the world. We have a deep leadership bench at Nike and I'm confident that our restructured leadership team will continue to strengthen our culture and drive the Consumer Direct Offense. So with that this call will be led by our CFO Andy Campion and me. So let's turn to the results we delivered in Q3 and the strong momentum we're building as we look forward. Simply put the Consumer Direct Offense is working. Through 2x innovation, we're creating and scaling new product platforms while also becoming sharper editors. Through 2x direct, we're moving closer to the consumer through differentiated retail concepts leading with our mobile apps, dotcom and digital partners. And through 2x speed, we're serving consumers at their pace. During our Investor Day, we discussed the significant potential we see in our international markets. And in this quarter, we delivered strong and sustainable growth across all of our international geographies. Take Greater China for example where positive macro trends are accelerating from consumer spending to sport participation. Looking ahead, we have a tremendous opportunity to expand our full digital portfolio leading with key cities like Shanghai and Beijing. We saw this quarter with our Greater China business growing 24%. The end of Q3 also marks a significant turn in North America where we expect a reversal of trend in Q4. We've secured some great early wins here through new Nike consumer experiences and differentiated retail across both our direct and partner channels. Overall, there is a strong global appetite for athletic footwear and apparel and we're amplifying and capturing that demand through our Consumer Direct offense and triple double strategy. The momentum we're building in all four geographies is a result of getting the right product in front of the consumer in the right moment and it's becoming increasingly clear that the closer we connect, our strong brand to consumers in the marketplace the greater the returns. So I'm excited to share some of the highlights of how we're executing the triple double and fueling our growth in our key categories. At Nike growth always begins with innovation and great product and this quarter through 2x innovation, we intensified the pace and scale of which we're bringing fresh and unexpected products to consumers. And we've done that by focusing our resources to create new platforms not just new models by diversifying those platforms across multiple styles and categories through our complete offense and by editing our assortments to offer more compelling choice of our power franchises. So let's start with the new platforms. What's most exciting about our momentum is that it's being driven through a performance lens delivering clear consumer benefits through platforms like the Air Vapormax and Nike React. The Air Vapormax for example is delivering lightweight comfort with a distinct style and it quickly became the number one performance shoe above the $100 price point and we're now scaling that platform into millions of pairs. We're doing that with new designs like the Vapormax 2.0, the Vapormax 97, and the Vapormax Utility. Turning to Nike React, the consumer response has set new records for performance innovation launch. We initially offered the product to NikePlus members exclusively selling out within hours and when we broadened the launch we sold through several weeks of supply in just four days. As we move into Q4, we'll leverage that demand by scaling the Epic React launching the Odyssey React, a new running shoe at $120 price point and leveraging our portfolio to expand React cushioning into sportswear, basketball and Jordan Icons. With the Airmax 270, we launched Nike's bold lifestyle specific Air platform with consumers responding to its comfort and style. Both the Air Vapormax and the Airmax 270 are fueling energy across our Nike Air family of products. With more Air innovation in the pipeline, we now expect to grow the Nike Air business by several billion dollars over the next few years. The greater scale of these platforms will create greater impact on our business into Q4 and beyond. With other innovation platforms, we're just getting started. For example, we invented a new process for Flyknit, which we unveiled with our Mercurial boots ahead of World Cup '18. Constructed in a 360 degree form that wraps the entire foot, it gives athletes better control over their movement. It's also incredibly efficient creating 60% less waste than traditional cut-and-sew methods. The Kobe 360 will be the next shoe to adopt this new process of digital knitting combined with the Nike React midsole to create an incredible court [ph] feel. And in just a few weeks, we'll unveil a new platform that I'm extremely excited about. It takes digital product creation to an entirely new place. And as we did with the ZoomX, 4% for Breaking2, we're working closely with Eliud Kipchoge on this one. I can't say much more today, but stay tuned to Q4. We have some other truly disruptive platforms ahead from HyperAdapt at new price points in new categories to non-powered adaptive footwear systems that improve fit to other lifestyle cushioning systems. We're also innovating in apparel. We've begun to unveil our high performance World Cup Vapor Knit kits with engineered yarns and open textures for breathability. In addition to designing the national team kits, we've created full lifestyle collections for fans. World Cup is such a powerful moment in sport and we look forward to amplifying its energy [Technical Difficulty] and sportswear businesses around the world. As we laid out in October, 2x direct is delivering a vision for a more differentiated marketplace connecting the Nike brand in deeper ways with consumers. And we're leading with our digital business which was up 18% on a currency neutral basis in Q3. And we just launched the SNKRS apps in China in December and in the first month alone we had 2 million downloads. And we're also scaling Nike+ membership with plans to launch in all 12 of our key cities within the next fiscal year. We're still in the early stages of Nike+ membership but we saw a strong consumer response in Q3 with new members rising more than 50% versus the same period last year. While we lead with digital we don't believe digital and physical retail operate in silos. In fact more and more they will intersect and amplify each other. For example in Q4, we're going to debut a new concept that we call Nike app at retail at both The Grove in Los Angeles and here in Portland. When you enter the doors, it recognizes you and opens up exclusive products in your approximately. You can scan for product availability in all nearby Nike doors or checkout and pay through the app with no waiting line. And if you are not in the store you can reserve product through the app and will hold it in a personal locker so you can try it on before buying. There are a number of other features that will be phased in as we test, initiate before scaling to a wider fleet of stores. What really powers all these immersive consumer experiences is great data and the ability to maximize. And while we're constantly building these skills in-house we're also acquiring capabilities to accelerate our strategy. Today, we're announcing that we've acquired an exceptional consumer data and analytics firm named Zodiac based in New York, this team of world class data scientists and their proprietary tools will help us deepen relationships with consumers all over the world with a primary focus on our Nike+ members. Better analytics are also a critical factor in our 2x speed initiative, as we sharpen our consumer sensing we can meet demand faster and deliver more relevant personalized products. We've made good product progress with our Express Lane teams especially in EMEA where Express Lane product is accelerating growth in our power franchise. In North America we are increasing our speed of delivery particularly around key cities. Our focus for fiscal '19 is to apply those learnings further and onto our biggest volume drivers around the world. The triple double comes to life through our categories. It's how we amplify sports biggest moments, connect to our brand emotionally with consumers and drive a complete offense to grow our business. So let's touch on a few of the category highlights from the quarter. The Nike basketball category had a very strong quarter growing double digits with growth across footwear and apparel in every geography and key city. We saw success with the launches of the Kyrie 4 and the PG2 and through the LeBron watch consumers could buy LeBron 15 player edition shoes as soon as he debut them on court. We've exceeded expectation in our first season as an official NBA partner growing the NBA business significantly over the last year. A major bright spot has been the iconic Showtime Hoodie. It's been a huge hit at retail and it's driven a whole new silhouette for Nike apparel. Perhaps the greatest source of brand energy for both Nike Basketball and the Jordan Brand was the NBA All-Star weekend in Los Angeles. Over the three days, we became the first brand to sell directly through snapchat with the Tinker AJ III selling out in just 23 minutes. We launched sneakers pass, our geo located digital wristband that unlocks access to IE product as we did with our Cortez collaboration with Kendrick Lamar. And we hosted thousands of consumers and our makers customization space. In college basketball, we're in the midst of one of the most unpredictable NCA tournaments in history. And Nike and Jordan once again show the strength of our partnerships sponsoring 85 teams across the men's and women's field from March Madness. With the Jordan brand, we're making the right moves to keep this iconic brand special and create sustained growth. This quarter, we deliberately tightened distribution in the North American marketplace while also driving extraordinary heat with the consumer. We launched Russell Westbrook, first signature performance shoe with the Why NotZer0.1. And we released limited edition Jordan III's on the SNKRS app immediately after Justin Timberlake wore them at the Super Bowl halftime show. We've talked about adding new dimensions to Jordan and this quarter we accelerated that strategy. Going forward, we will carefully manage the distribution of iconic styles, we will more completely leverage the company's innovation platforms to supercharge Jordan's performance products, we will expand into new categories beyond basketball and sportswear and drive our biggest growth opportunities in international apparel and women's. Moving onto our largest and most influential performance category running where we're driving more innovation than any other time in our history. In addition to all the platforms we discussed, we're focused on growing our core footwear business using our Express Lane to seize opportunities and we're adding new dimensions to our power franchises like the Zoom Pegasus. For example, this summer the women's Zoom Pegasus 35 will have cushioning, it's better tuned to her. And the new Peg Turbo will include ZoomX foam making our breakthrough platform accessible to more runners. We also had a very strong quarter in our sportswear category, which continue to grow double digits with strong growth across both footwear and apparel. Technically led the way in apparel, while in footwear we led with the Air Force 1, Cortez, Blazer, Tenjin and Airmax. Our women's business overall continues to accelerate, we created our first women's collection with both Nike and the Jordan Brand. The one reimagined featured 14 Nike women's designers who reinterpreted two of our greatest icons in the Air Jordan 1 and the Air Force 1. One of the best examples of our edit to amplify approach came from the women's team this quarter with a new retail concept we call unlaced. This new sneaker destination offers collections edited by leading stylists and will give access to a wider range of sizes for the first time with exclusive colors and elevated services. Unlace will be both a physical and digital experience starting with nike.com in North America. It will debut at Nike Soho this summer and then roll out to over 200 Nike direct and wholesale partner doors by the end of the calendar year. As you can tell, we were extremely productive this quarter. We're looking at every opportunity to improve and we're investing in the opportunities with the greatest impact. We feel very good about the short-term momentum we're driving and the foundation we are setting for long-term accelerated growth. With that, now here's Andy to provide more detail on the financial performance of our reported segment and our outlook. Andy Campion : Thanks Mark and hello everyone on the call. Our Q3 operating results make it clear that the Consumer Direct Offense is already igniting Nike's next horizon of strong profitable growth. And there are several key themes within our performance that speak to the long-term sustainability of our momentum. First, we exceeded the revenue and gross margin expectations that we set 90 days ago fueled by an unprecedented flow of new products and innovation platforms that will scale over time. As Mark detailed in the third quarter, we launched the Nike React and the Airmax 270 platforms to extraordinary consumer demand. We also began to scale and diversify the Air Vapormax platform and the ZoomX platform and running continues to sell out as we launched new colorways. While we're clearly doubling the canes and impact of innovation our product momentum is even broader based. Our edit to amplify approach is bringing focus and accelerating growth within our power franchises like the Air Force 1 family of products and other key styles. We're running a much more complete offense, yet we still see tremendous opportunity to improve and edit how we serve our consumers. Second, our results in Q3 confirm that the Nike brand more directly connects with consumers, we see the greatest growth. Our Nike digital ecosystem in particular is setting the pace for growth in all four of our geographies. On a currency neutral basis, nike.com grew 18% globally driven by the expansion of our digital apps in international markets as well as the launch of Nike+ membership in North America. In each of our international geographies, nike.com's rate of growth outpaced the overall marketplace rate of growth by 2x or greater. And in North America nike.com not only grew but has been accelerating over the last two months. Nike consumer experiences at retail are also resonating. That includes owned and partnered digital and physical experiences. In Q3 Nike consumer experiences comprised more than 50% of our total revenue and drove over 100% of our revenue growth. In other words, we're both growing and reshaping the marketplace toward the vision that we share with you at our Investor Day. Third, as we exit Q3, we will put two significant headwinds largely behind us. At current rates, we expect the impact of foreign exchange on EBIT net of hedging to be roughly neutral in Q4 and begin shifting to a slight tailwind in fiscal year '19. At the same time as Mark said the close of Q3 marks a reversal of trend for North America. We have reset Nike's supply; we're fueling demand through the launch of innovative products. We have reignited brand heat. We're connecting more directly with consumers through our digital ecosystem and orders from our strategic partners are building. In short, Nike has returned to a pool market in North America. Nike North America revenue is now projected to be roughly flat to prior year in Q4 and return to growth in the first half of fiscal year '19. But before I share more on our outlook lets first touch on our Q3 results. Q3 reported revenue grew 7% as continued strong double-digit international growth and Nike direct growth in all geographies was partially offset by an expected contraction in North America wholesale revenue driven by undifferentiated doors. Gross margin contracted 70 basis points in Q3 a stronger result than we expected 90 days ago as our launches and stronger sell through fuel expanding full price gross margin. However, that expansion was more than offset by approximately 90 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. Total SG&A was up 11% in Q3 operating overhead increased 9% driven by investments in our Nike direct businesses and demand creation increased 15% primarily driven by sports marketing and activations related to the NBA All-Star weekend as well as new product innovation launches. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was roughly 180% including the one-time impacts related to the U.S. tax cuts and Jobs Act. Income tax expense included provisional charges of $2 billion primarily related to the transition tax on our accumulated foreign earnings and the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The onetime charges include some non-cash impacts with the cash impacts to be paid over several years. The impact of U.S. tax reform is slightly favorable to Nike in terms of both our normalized steady state effective tax rate and more efficient access to capital. When I speak to our outlook, I'll provide more dimension on the go forward implications and tax reform. As a result, Q3 diluted EPS was a loss of $0.57 that said the one-time impact of U.S. tax reform had a $1.25 impact on EPS in the quarter excluding that impact our profitability in Q3 exceeded our expectations. As of February 28, inventories were up 9% leading into Q4 as we scale our new innovations globally and capitalize on strong consumer demand. Q3 inventory growth was primarily driven by aligning in-season product to our stronger forecast demand while off price inventory declined year-over-year on a currency neutral basis. This quarter we saw a return to modest growth in North America inventory as we anniversary our efforts to tighten supply in the prior year and shift to a full market. Internationally our inventory levels are also healthy and generally aligned with the strong demand we continue to forecast in those markets. Now let's turn to the financial performance for our operating segments. In North America, nike.com differentiated Nike consumer experiences in retail, the impact of Nike innovation and brand heat are driving increasingly stronger demand. While North America declined 6% for the quarter, we expect that the momentum will now reverse the trend. While undifferentiated wholesale dimensions of the marketplace declined we are delivering and accelerating growth in Nike consumer experiences in aggregate across owned and partner with nike.com in particular accelerating to strong double-digit growth as we progress through the quarter. Our partners are also increasingly bringing Nike consumer experiences to life in the marketplace. As an example of Finish Line's Culver City store in L.A. was reset with Nike Epic React as the only product available in the store across all brands for three days. The execution brought together new innovative Nike product with great storytelling through our shoes-go campaign and expert service. The results were amazing and served as a proof point for the potential of Nike consumer experiences operated by a strategic partner in the U.S. marketplace. As Mark noted, year-over-year comparisons in North America were also impacted by our quick and deliberate tightening of the distribution of select styles within the Jordan brand. That said as we enter Q4, we believe Jordan inventories are now clean and we also began reigniting Jordan brand heat in the marketplace through the launches and activations over the NBA All-Star weekend. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to continue adding dimension to the Jordan brand through both performance and lifestyle product. For the quarter EBIT in North America was down 14% versus the prior year primarily driven by lower revenues and a higher selling and administrative expenses. Moving on to EMEA, where we continue to see incredibly strong momentum, in a region that is at the leading edge of consumer preferences. EMEA revenue grew 9% on a currency neutral basis in Q3 two of the hottest styles in the marketplace are the Air Vapormax and Airmax 97 and we're also seeing industry leading growth in apparel driven by our tech fleece business. Our growth in EMEA was also aided by our Express Lane, which is already quickly translating regional consumer preferences into color and material updates with respect to our power franchises. Overall growth in EMEA was led by very strong nike.com results as well as strong results with key strategic partners. Key strategic partners who are also relentlessly consumer focused and digitally connected such as JD and Zalando. Categorically, we saw double-digit growth in sportswear, men's training and Nike basketball. We expect continued strong growth in EMEA and we're excited about the impact of the upcoming World Cup. On a reported basis EMEA revenue increased 19% and EBIT grew 16% as strong revenue growth was partially offset by lower gross margin due to transactional effects [indiscernible]. Next let's turn to Greater China having just been in China two weeks ago, I can tell you the Greater China not only continues to lead Nike in terms of the pace of growth, but also in terms of executing the Consumer Direct Offense. In Q3, Greater China was up 19% on a currency neutral basis driven by strong double-digit growth across nearly all dimensions of the business but notably led by digital. Digital momentum in the quarter was fueled by the launch of the SNKRS app in China and the continued success of our partnership with TMall. And while our digital growth has been extraordinary we have not even yet launched Nike+ membership in China that is now slated for Q1 of fiscal year '19. Also worth calling out our women's business in greater China has incredible momentum with double-digit growth driven by our innovation and power franchises including styles designed specifically to connect with consumers around the Chinese New Year. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue grew 24% and EBIT was up 30% due to strong revenue growth and SG&A leverage. In APLA revenue grew 11% on a currency neutral basis led by digital growth that significantly outpaced every other channel. To unlock digital growth even more broadly, we will be more aggressively rolling out our digital platforms into key markets across APLA. One real-time example is the SNKRS app which just launched in Japan yesterday. It immediately surged to become Japan's number one free downloaded app in the iOS store. APLA was also fueled by the brand energy surrounding the Winter Olympics in Korea which helped drive strong and balanced double-digit growth across nearly every dimension. Women's, men's, footwear, apparel and across many categories. On a reported basis, Q3 revenue in APLA was up 13% and EBIT grew 31% driven by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. And finally at Converse, Q3 revenue declined 8% on a currency neutral basis as we rebalanced marketplace supply in North America. On a reported basis revenue declined 3% and EBIT was down 37%. Looking forward, we will continue to invest in reigniting strong sustainable profitable growth at Converse. More specifically we're dimensionalizing Converse's product portfolio through the One Star, Chuck 70 and other sports and sport inspired styles investing in more converse specific digital platforms and creating heat and energy for the brand through new collaboration. So with that, I'll now move to our outlook for the balance of the year. We remain confident we will deliver on the growth and profitability expectations that we have previously communicated for fiscal year 2018 excluding the one-time impact of U.S. tax reform. We will continue to invest in the key pillars of our strategy and drive accelerated growth in the dimensions of our portfolio that we highlighted in our Investor Day in October. We remain focused on what matters most to consumers and in turn what will fuel strong sustainable profitable growth over the long-term. As for specific guidance, we expect Q4 reported revenue to grow in the high single digit range. This growth reflects continued strength in our international geographies and the reversal of trend we're building in North America. We expect Q4 gross margin to be roughly flat to very slightly up versus the prior year demonstrating progressively stronger currency neutral gross margin expansion that will be almost fully offset by transactional FX headwinds albeit lesser transactional FX headwinds than in prior quarters. For SG&A, we expect low teens growth in Q4. We will continue to invest in digital and membership including completing the acquisitions of some key digital capabilities within the quarter as well as brand marketing and supportive innovation and impactful consumer moments such as Airmax Day and the World Cup. At current FX rates, we expect other income and expense net of interest expense to be approximately $30 million to $40 million of expense in Q4. We expect our effective tax rate for Q4 to be in the 10% to 12% range. It's important to note that our tax rate may be volatile as we expect to continue receiving more specific legislative and regulatory guidance as to the application of the U.S. Tax Act. Now looking ahead to fiscal year '19, while our planning is not yet finalized we currently expect fiscal year '19 reported revenue growth in the mid to high single-digit range as international momentum continues and we return to growth in North America. We also expect strong gross margin expansion roughly in line with our long-term financial model. In fiscal year '19, we will also see the full impact of U.S. tax reform on our access to capital and investments as well as the tax rate U.S. tax reform will certainly afford Nike more efficient access to capital. So as we finalize our investment plans for the next fiscal year, we are prioritizing accelerated investment in the select dimensions of our business that will fuel Nike's Consumer Direct Offense and drive long-term growth. At the top of our list is digital ranging from new Nike+ membership experiences to new capabilities including data and analytics to our core enterprise resource planning platform. Our acquisition of Zodiac a leading consumer data and analytics team was a great example of us seizing an opportunity to accelerate Nike's capability development. We will also continue to prioritize investment in innovation, brand distinction, new Nike consumer experiences in the marketplace and a faster more responsive supply chain. The incremental and more efficient access to capital will also enable us to amplify our returns to shareholders and complete our existing four year $12 billion share repurchase program within fiscal year '19 roughly one year earlier than originally planned. We currently expect U.S. tax reform to have a neutral to slightly favorable impact on our steady-state effective tax rate, which we would characterize as being in the teens on a normalized basis. That said in any given fiscal year geographical earnings mix the impact of the new stock based compensation accounting rules and other discrete items will create volatility in our rate. In fiscal year '19 specifically, our rate may also be impacted by adjustments to the provisional charges that we're accruing this quarter. Taking all of these factors into consideration, we will provide our updated outlook for fiscal year '19 on our Q4 earnings call. As Mark said our Consumer Direct Offense is working. Nike innovation is fueling strong consumer demand. Nike digital is accelerating. Our brands have great energy and our organization is aligned and executing against what matters most to consumers. Nike's next horizon of strong sustainable profitable growth is underway. With that, we will now open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Omar Saad : Thanks. Good evening. Mark Parker : Good morning, Omar. Omar Saad : I wanted to ask you guys -- great job on the quarter by the way, it's great to hear all the progress and a lot of information on the call as well. It\u2019s much appreciated. Mark Parker : Thank you. Omar Saad : The reshaping of the marketplace, wholesale especially going from I think 30000 to 40,000 partners, can you talk about the progress along that transformation where we are, what the impact has been, and maybe also layer in and put that in the context of the growth in the consumer experiences. You spent so much time talking about that aspect where you're engaging with consumers. I thought you said it was over 100% of the growth in the quarter. Are you seeing a lot of that new channel development offset that reshaping on the wholesale side? Is that the right way to think about it? Thanks guys. Mark Parker : Thanks Omar. Well, let's go back to the Investor meeting in October. We laid out how we want to shift the look of our overall marketplace. To be 80% differentiated is our target and that's over the next five years. And I'd say as we commented we're making some great progress on that front. You pointed out and that's what we said is Nike consumer experiences drove 100% of the growth in the quarter. That's double-digit increases in new NikePlus members which is a really key part of that strategy. We've had great feedback in terms of the NBA All-star weekend and some of the sell through in basketball, we are seeing and that involves not only our direct doors but some of our key partners. NBA All-star weekend, we had Kits and Revolve as two examples. Foot Locker was participating in that as well. And then, we're bringing some of the new concepts to market here starting very quickly with Nike Unlaced with a digital launch and then physical coming up in summer, the Nike app at retail and HyperLive are some of the examples there. As far as our -- this is impacting our overall marketplace, we're working with our key partners to help differentiate them in their respective positions. Those conversations are ongoing with most strategic partners. We've aligned on the role that they play in serving our consumers from Dick\u2019s to Foot Locker to Nordstrom, and this is not only physical retail but its how physical and digital interact. And then, we have other digital partners which are obviously key to this transformation. Zalando and TMall, ASOS and even Instagram for example. So this is a multi-year journey for us, and I'd say we're making great progress in shaping that marketplace and I think we'll continue to elevate our own direct business, but we will also help to differentiate and elevate our key wholesale partners along the way. Omar Saad : And Mark, one follow up. In terms of the new shoe launches, you\u2019ve talked about SNKRS and some of the other apps. Is this the new model for kind of those premium limited distribution shoe launches whether you're doing it internally or with a partner versus kind of the old world model? Is that the right way to think about it? Thanks. Mark Parker : I think digital and mobile apps for example are going to play a big and bigger role in how we launch some of these key innovations and platforms. It's definitely how consumers are shopping, and it's definitely where we're putting a lot of emphasis on how we orchestrate these launches, how we invest to serve the consumers through those apps. I think you'll see more storytelling coming to life from a digital standpoint including our mobile app based launches. So yes, I think you'll see this become a bigger and bigger part of our strategy and a bigger part of the results that we're seeing. Andy Campion : And then just to add to that Omar, as Mark touched on in his remarks, ideally we're also leveraging these digital applications in the physical retail environment, and we're going to be testing and iterating on the launch of the Nike app at Retail with our key flagship stores in our key cities, starting with North America. Mark Parker : That's a key point is the integration of physical and digital, which obviously is something that everybody is talking about. But you'll see that happen more and more with how we roll out new experiences in our own physical retail doors is that connection to digital. So this connection is going to start to blur more and more and I think one will complement the other. Nitesh Sharan : Thanks Omar. Operator, we will take the next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi Research. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Hi. Thank you. It's Corinna Van der Ghinst for Kate. You guys discussed the success of the Vapormax, some of these Air platforms and the React which I finally just got my hands on. But, we were just wondering what gives you confidence in the inflection in North America when the Q3 top-line was actually weaker than Q2? Mark Parker : Well, if you look at Q3, there is momentum that has been building through the quarter and that's where the confidence we have in terms of Q4 comes from. We're on the front end of obviously, the very front end of launching React and the response has been phenomenal. I think I said it's been a record-setting performance launch for Nike. I think that's also a case of a performance basis that has also translated well into a product that can be worn on the street. So there's performance actually driving sportswear and lifestyle in one product. The other aspect of that is, we are very committed to developing our platforms, so React starts with the Epic React running shoe, but you'll see that play out in other categories and also in more models at different price points within running. So I think that leverage is only going to build over time and that's something that isn't unique to react. It's also what we're seeing in Vapormax as well. And then, nike.com in the quarter has been a case of month-to-month acceleration and that's driven also in part by these launches and we think that that is going to continue at a strong pace and accelerate really through Q4 and beyond. So that's a big part of this as well. Andy Campion : Yes. And I just add, our results in the third quarter in North America were largely in line with what we expected in the quarter. The contraction was primarily a result of declines in undifferentiated wholesale and a deliberate tightening in the distribution styles within the Jordan brand. So that did have an impact on year-over-year comparisons. But as we said, we're really excited about the heat we've reignited with that brand and the clean inventory levels that we have there too. And then to your point on innovation platforms, one of the metrics that we look very closely at is the rate of sell through as we launch products at the initial levels of supply and the rate of sell through on the Nike React in particular the Airmax 270 and those other styles far exceeded our expectations. We talked about supply selling out in hours with members and in days as compared to what we expected would be weeks with more broader distribution. So that's a leading indicator of the magnitude of demand for those new innovation platforms. Mark Parker : I think it's safe to say that these key styles and platforms are accelerating at a more rapid pace than we've seen historically and we're doing everything we can to accelerate and leverage those platforms within the Nike brand, but across categories but also across the brands in the portfolio. Corinna Van der Ghinst : Thanks very helpful. Thank you. Nitesh Sharan : Operator we will take the next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Jim Duffy : Thank you. Hello everyone. Andy, I'll start with a question for you. Your initial comments around gross margin for fiscal '19 are encouraging. It's been a long time since that FX was in but a headwind there. Was FX now expected to make a positive contribution in fiscal '19? Are there other offsets that are holding back gross margin to keep it within your kind of long-term objective range? Andy Campion : Well, there are obviously a number of factors within gross margin as I said we see strong gross margin expansion roughly in line with our long-term financial model. We're still completing or finalizing or planning, so we're not providing more specific guidance than that at this point. As for product cost, labor and some other input costs are increasing a little bit but we do still see strong gross pricing margin expansion in addition to FX becoming a slight tailwind. So all of those things are incorporated in our guidance. I think the headline is we see strong gross margin expansion. And to your point, we're looking forward to putting those FX headwinds behind us, but we'll update you with more specifics in terms of a range on our Q4 call. Jim Duffy : Great. Thanks. Mark, question around Zodiac, do they have any particular strength or competency that you saw as strategic. I guess I'm curious are there particular algorithms or predictive analytics that distinguish them from your in-house capabilities or other outsourced alternatives? And then, related analytics, do you see that as an in-house competency, is that your objective to really strengthen that muscle in-house or do you expect to work with partners on an outsource spaces? Mark Parker : Yes. Well, first of all, the first part of your question Zodiac is a small tech company really comprised of world-class scientists and engineers who are based out of New York. They bring in-depth understanding of how to optimize consumer value and understand what's behind consumer growth or potential. We've been working with Zodiac for the past several months using their proprietary algorithms and models and I'd say we're just extremely excited about how we can more fully leverage those capabilities to accelerate some of the key pillars of our strategy. And one of the areas that I think I'd particularly call out is how they can help us power up our Nike membership to better leverage the data there to capture demand signals in our key cities and help to inform our Express Lane. Yes. Andy Campion : And I just add Jim, you asked is this acquisition versus in-house? The short answer is we're both building the capabilities in-house to drive our digital offense and selectively acquiring teams or technology to accelerate against that build. So we already have made significant investments in building our Nike membership team and data analytics capabilities and are fortunate to have some great talent that's joined our company over the past couple of years and bringing on teams like that at Zodiac and some other teams that we've been in discussion with are additive. Mark Parker : Yes. Advancing this capability, I would just say is, absolutely fundamental to fueling the strategy that we have in front of us, which is to be more personal at scale. So this is directly in line with that that critical part of our strategy. Nitesh Sharan : Thank you, Jim. Operator, we will take the next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura Instinet. Simeon Siegel : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon guys. So recognizing exciting innovation. Any help thinking through your expectations for footwear versus apparel embedded within the North America guidance? And then just any further color you can share on the Amazon test? Thanks. Andy Campion : Okay. Well, we certainly see strong growth in both footwear and apparel. Looking backwards, we've had incredibly strong growth in apparel. I mentioned that apparel was -- our growth in apparel was industry leading in EMEA driven by our tech fleece business and some other innovative products like the Flyknit bra and other products within our portfolio. We see these launches of innovation as well as our focus on the power franchises fueling accelerating growth in footwear. So that it's more balanced going into fiscal year '19. Mark Parker : Yes. I'll just add that apparel sometimes falls in the shadow of footwear, but we are one of the largest apparel companies in the world. I think our strength comes from both our performance position and how we leverage that across sportswear. So actually we're very excited about some of the performance innovation coming in apparel. In fact our 2x innovation initiative commitment is equally being applied to apparel. And I think that will impact a product that you'll see at the World Cup, you'll see it at the NBA championships, you're seeing with our relationship with the NBA across all sport categories training. And then, it will wind up influencing more and more of the sportswear category as well where we are performing incredibly well. I'm really excited about what's coming in innovation and apparel, and then, our ability to kind of push on both sides of the performance and sportswear side. So there's a lot coming in apparel and frankly there's a lot coming in footwear -- a lot more coming in footwear than we've talked about. So I think our 2x innovation investments which really kicked into gear about two years ago are really starting to pay off. Anyway back to your second question, Amazon as you know we have -- I think you know we have been extended our pilot with Amazon and to-date it's a smaller U.S. based pilot, it's performed quite well. We've seen good sell through on a limited selection of products. We're expanding that selection of products over this next phase. Our focus on this relationship really is, how we can best work together to elevate the consumer experience and that's really a key part of all of our digital partnerships. So we continue to engage with the U.S. Digital Marketplace to look at how we can serve digital demand from consumers and Amazon is definitely a part of that. We get just a backup for a second and get the most out of the partnerships that advance our brand through better presentation through the sharing of data TMall in China, Zalando in Europe. These are great examples of those types of relationships. So we'll continue to work with Amazon to what we think will be a mutually beneficial partnership over the months ahead. Nitesh Sharan : Thank you, Simeon. Operator, we'll take the next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : Hey guys. Good afternoon. Nice quarter congrats. Thanks for getting me in here. I'd like to ask about the investments for next year. You gave some help on the on the top-line and how to think about some of the shape of the P&L. But the investments obviously seem to be working up and down the commentary you guys are happy about it. I mean can we think about whether you'd be interested in front loading some of those investments a little more now. And can you speak to maybe how much you think SG&A growth rate would be next year is it faster than this year slower than this year with a newfound success in the investments and just any directional puts and takes to help us think about how the fiscal year and your early planning looks next to the mid-teens, long-term EPS algorithm? Andy Campion : Yes. Well as you know Michael we didn't give specific SG&A guidance for fiscal year '19 and there are really two reasons for that. One, we've never operated because we're not. We've never operated as if we are and we aren't capital constrained. So our top priority as we look ahead to any given fiscal year is to ensure that we're prioritizing the investments that are going to fuel growth over the long-term as compared to adhering to rigidly to a specific metric in the short-term period. The Tax Act does also afford us even more efficient access to the cash flow and the capital that we generate around the world. So yes, our planning process is taking both of those into account in the context of us having a new very focused strategy. So we're prioritizing investments specifically in innovation. I've told you in the past that we've doubled the investment innovation. We continue to make incremental investments there and I want to pause there for a moment. It's really a competitive advantage for Nike. We currently invest probably more than any other brand in the marketplace, but we're going to continue to make incremental meaningful investments. But those investments are still relatively insignificant compared to the kind of growth and returns that they generate when we consider launches like React to Vapormax and the other platforms that Mark and I have shared. So innovation is certainly a priority. We're going to continue to drive brand distinction. You probably saw our shoes go campaign over the last several months and the energy that that's creating as well as some of the energy recreated against the All-Star Weekend and other big moments in sport. And I would say even though I'm mentioning it third at the top of our list is digital capabilities both building them and like we said acquiring capabilities through teams like the team we acquired in Zodiac. And then, there are really two final areas that are on our short list of priorities making consumer experiences owned and partner that as Mark noted integrate or leverage digital in the physical environment. We are clearly doing that ourselves and we're increasingly doing that with our partners all at various stages of development. But, we are going to continue to test and iterate there. And then finally, we are prioritizing investment in Speed through two key initiatives, our Express Lane and Responsive Manufacturing. So in short, we believe these are investments that are going to drive brand distinction for Nike and fuel our next horizon of long-term sustainable profitable growth and we are going to over index our investment in those dimensions. Michael Binetti : Thanks for that. And can I ask a quick follow-up, obviously, you are squeezing a lot of -- more funding squeeze, you talked about, it's good to hear. But then, in your comment about nike.com North America accelerating to strong double digit growth. I know one dimension that channel has been the close out sales that you guys have been so focused on the back end -- past few quarters. And you called it out in the 10-K as the markdowns what will help the margin fact there? Can you give us a sense of how much excess markdowns contribute to the gross margin in third quarter that we will see in the 10-Q and do you think that line in the gross margin atypically give us will be reversing significantly to line up with the comments that you made here today about the foam market? Mark Parker : Yes. I will give you a few data points on that. Overall, ASPs for the entire enterprise were up and ASPs in North America were slightly up all in. On nike.com, we saw some of the margin upside that we delivered versus the expectations we set 90 days ago was actually based on stronger gross margin in our Nike direct businesses and in particular in North America. We are seeing stronger full price sell through and we are seeing better margin on the off-price dimension of that business. Now the off-price dimension of digital is bigger today than it might have been a couple of years ago, so on a relative basis, you've got more off-price in digital and general in the marketplace but not in partner. But, I would say that has been the source of margin expansion for us. And I just summarize it by saying, we are really confident in the go forward impact of both what we are doing from a product perspective and innovation and power franchises as well as the impact of the Nike direct and digital and Nike consumer experiences on our margin. Michael Binetti : That's really, really helpful. Mark Parker : Thank you, Michael. Michael Binetti : Thanks. Nitesh Sharan : Thank you. Okay. That's all we have time for today. Thank you everyone for joining. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So, we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event, you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to requeue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker. Mark Parker : Thanks, Nitesh, and hello and good afternoon, everyone. We had a strong fourth quarter with results that confirm why we\u2019re so excited about potential of the Consumer Direct Offense. The shifts we\u2019ve made to our business and our deeper focus on the three core areas, innovation, direct and speed are igniting the next phase of growth and profitability for NIKE. Here are the key areas where we\u2019re driving momentum in our business. First, we\u2019re winning with new innovation. We\u2019re leading with platforms, not just products. For example React and Air Max are scaling through multiple styles and across categories. They\u2019re driving extraordinary growth and brand heat with consumers. Second, our Digital Offense is transforming NIKE from how we connect with consumers to how we deliver products. This is a major shift from operating models of the past to a new digitally powered model of the future. And third, with a more focused strategy, we\u2019re running a more complete portfolio with better balanced growth across geographies and categories. For the quarter, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 13% on a reported basis. Specific highlights include our international business growing 23% with Greater China up 35%. We returned to healthy, sustainable growth in North America. Sportswear, a $10 billion business for NIKE had another quarter of double-digit growth. We saw a solid momentum in key performance categories and digital, NIKE Digital was up 41% for the quarter. The key to accelerating our strength is to continue to sharpen the execution of our Triple Double. And looking at our progress this quarter, I\u2019ll start with 2X Innovation. The lineup of fresh, unexpected products that we shared with you last fall at our Investor Day, has entered the marketplace. And as I noted, the consumer has responded. NIKE React for example is living up to big expectations. We extended the launch momentum from last quarter and scaled significantly with excellent sell-through globally. The Epic React is already the number two performance running shoe in the marketplace, above $125, only trailing the Air VaporMax. And Zoom Air continues to be the training platform of choice for serious runners led by our best selling Pegasus line. Our latest, the Peg 35 has the highest bookings in the first season for any Pegasus in our history. Overall, running grew 7% for fiscal year \u201818. And with the loaded pipeline in fiscal \u201819, led by the Peg Turbo with ZoomX cushioning, we see a great runway ahead for our largest performance category. In Sportswear, the consumer demand for all-day comfort is making Air Max one of the fastest growing platforms in our industry. Our icons, the Air Max Plus, 95, 97 and 98 are all performing incredibly well. Air VaporMax, built on that demand, and this quarter we took it a step further with NIKE's first innovation built specifically for lifestyle, Air Max 270. Since launching in March, 270 is the most successful Air Max launch in our history. And it\u2019s one of the driving forces behind Sportswear, a category that delivered more than $2.6 billion in revenue in Q4, its best quarter ever. [Technical Difficulty]. Can you hear me clearly there? Okay. All right. Sorry about that. Let's take this back up again. So I said, you should look for more Air Max platforms in the seasons ahead, pushing the boundaries on lifestyle innovation. Air is one of NIKE's greatest competitive differentiators and it continues to fuel extraordinary growth. Sportswear has begun to integrate NIKE React into new styles with more to come throughout fiscal year \u201819, including new icons from Jordan. The success of our new cushioning platforms is driving momentum in our women's business as well. In fact, following our launches the past three months, the 270, VaporMax and Epic React are already the top three selling women's athletic footwear models, above $125. Overall, women's lifestyle product continues to set the pace for the category. For the quarter, women saw the Air Force 1 continuing its strong momentum, The Blazer ramping up quickly in China and APLA, and key Air Max icons growing triple digits. One of our biggest opportunities for fiscal \u201819 is to scale our women's sneaker business across both NIKE and Jordan. In women's apparel, lifestyle is also leading the way, highlighted by strong growth in tops and fleece. And looking ahead, we're building on our leadership in bras and bringing more innovation through Flyknit apparel in the second half of the year. And as a part of our more holistic point of view on women\u2019s across Running, Training and Sportswear, we'll roll out a new approach with seasonal head-to-toe capsules and collections, like we did with the Meshed Up collection this quarter. There is great energy across our women's products and marketplace teams right now. One of our most important performance categories, NIKE Basketball has produced strong momentum this year off the back of the NBA partnership and high demand for key signature styles. We\u2019ve had an amazing year one with the NBA. We had a lot of firsts this year, but I\u2019d say our three biggest wins were our editions approach to jerseys, driving significantly higher NBA jersey sales than the league has ever had; the Showtime Hoodie, which is a new premium apparel business for fiscal \u201818, with sell-through approaching 100% across most teams and channels; and the steady flow of LeBron Player Edition footwear that we launched through LeBron Watch on the SNKRS app, this is a new feature that turns the on-court footwear into real-time buying opportunities. Jordan Brand proved, too, that the NBA is the ultimate sneaker runway. In many ways, Jordan defines the spectrum of performance and style as part of the pre-game walk-in on the court with the game\u2019s best players and courtside with fans. But we know consumers are demanding more from Jordan, and we know that people want wider access and new dimensions, and we\u2019re delivering. This quarter, we nearly tripled the size of Jordan\u2019s women\u2019s sneaker business,  Jordan apparel was up double digits in all geos, and the Jordan Brand in China was up nearly 50%. These are the areas where we see exponential growth and we\u2019ll continue to focus. We have a lot of opportunities to expand the Jordan portfolio of products to create a greater range of choice and to match the energy of the Jordan Brand. For both, NIKE and Jordan, our partnerships with the world\u2019s best leagues, teams and athletes are what fuel our growth. Nobody is better positioned to harness the expanding power of sport. Just look back at the moments and performances from our athletes over the last few weeks. Kevin Durant won back-to-back NBA titles and Finals MVP awards. Eliud Kipchoge won the London Marathon in our new 3D printed uppers with Flyprint and ZoomX, Brooks Koepka winning the U.S. Open for the second year in a row, and at the French Open, Simona Halep won her first title, and Rafael Nadal won his unrivalled 11th at Roland Garros. And of course, we\u2019re two weeks into one of the world\u2019s greatest sports moment, the World Cup where the energy for the NIKE brand has been tremendous. With over 60% of the players in the opening round wearing NIKE boots. In fact, [technical difficulty] scored by players in NIKE boots than all other brands combined with Harry Kane and Cristiano Ronaldo leading the way. We also debuted the latest generation of NIKE Flyknit, the Mercurial Superfly, 360 and Vapor 360. In apparel, we\u2019ve seen strong sell-through of our performance kits, and we\u2019ve designed full collections across performance, training and sportswear for key national teams including England, France, Portugal, Brazil and Nigeria. This quarter, we also made an important commitment to our future in football. We entered into a 10-year partnership with the China Super League, one of the fastest-growing football nations in the world. The stories of our athletes and the innovation they inspire have always been central to our brand. And today, those products and stories are being amplified even further by the power of digital. We\u2019ve talked about how critical mobile and social experiences are to our consumer and how that\u2019s driving change. But, really, the full digital transformation of NIKE that\u2019s taking place right now is even bigger than that. It's fundamentally shifting our entire company. Digital is allowing us to realize our vision for smart retail to remove friction and personalize experiences through the intersection of digital and physical environments. It\u2019s sharpening our ability to sense the market through data and analytics. It's unlocking new manufacturing tools that are more precise and drive a new esthetic. And it's opening up opportunities for new partnerships and how we develop talent in the organization. Let's start with how digital is fueling 2X Direct in our mission to lead the industry to more differentiated marketplace through NIKE consumer experiences. In our own ecosystem, NIKE Plus membership is the key to an elevated consumer experience. Once someone becomes a member and customizes their profile, we know what sports they like, how active they are, and the style of products they prefer. And that insight allows or unlocks for exclusive product, style advice from experts and rewards for their activity. It personalizes the entire experience and allows us to remove friction points for members as they move seamlessly from mobile to the in-store environment. We've relaunched NIKE Plus membership in November. And for the year, we've exceeded all of our membership targets with strong growth in new, active and buying members and improvement in engagement and in conversion. And we continue to explore the physical and digital intersection through our new NIKE app at retail, which is beginning to scale some multiple stores. Through Smart Retail, we can aggregate consumer buying patterns to better inform localized preferences and turn those into new growth opportunities. For example, next month, we're opening a new retail concept in LA, called NIKE Live. It's a small format, data-driven store with its assortment influenced by what consumers are buying from surrounding zip codes. We see great potential on this approach, and you'll see a lot more of it across our key cities. Digital innovation also allows us to push the edges of new immersive experiences whether that's in our own channels, or through partnered retail or social media platforms. The SNKRS App has delivered some incredibly compelling experiences this quarter. For example that venues during Kendrick Lamar\u2019s recent tour, we triggered SNKRS stash drops to make his Cortez Kenny III shoe available exclusively to his fans who are at the show. The SNKRS App is creating incredible demand and capturing more value from that energy as one of NIKE's largest upside opportunities for fiscal \u201819 and beyond. Our investments in the digital experience are also creating a platform for new brand-friendly e-commerce partnerships. Our work with Tmall continues to set the bar for how we co-create shopping experiences through mobile and social. This quarter, we leveraged key shopping moments for Air Max on Tmall's Super Brand Day and Young Athletes during its parent\u2019s channel launch. We continue to expand our presence in digital marketplaces through partnerships like Zalando in EMA and ZOZO-town in Japan which became fully operational in March. And we see huge potential emerging storytelling and shopping through our social platforms. This quarter, NIKE became one of the first companies to drive new consumer experiences in Facebook Messenger app, leveraging the AR camera to reveal the Kyrie 4 Red Carpet. To look for more exciting new shopping experiences with Facebook and other social media platforms in the coming months. And as we noted at Investor Day, we\u2019re also piloting and scaling NIKE Consumer Experiences with key wholesale partners. For example, the NIKE Certified Athletes program turned selected Foot Locker associates into NIKE experts. And after showing strong early results, Foot Locker will scale the program across North America in Q1. And with JD group in EMEA, we launched both a physical and digital concept to celebrate Air Max storytelling, called Undisputed Air, driving triple-digit growth of NIKE Air products in JD versus last year. Digital acceleration is also critical to creating an overall faster company, from consumer insight to responsive manufacturing to delivering products to the consumer when they want it. In other words, it is integral to our 2X Speed initiative. In fiscal 18, we\u2019ve invested significantly in the capabilities that heighten our ability to sense the market and drive efficiency through our supply chain. We scaled seven key distribution centers around the world this year. One of the facilities in North America is our new Rebound facility, the first to be focused solely on accepting returned products and getting it back into the market place significantly faster, to maximize full price, in-season selling. We\u2019ve also integrated the Zodiac team from our recent acquisition who are giving us new predictive tools and advanced analytics to drive targeted growth. And we continued to develop our sensing capabilities within our key cities and sharpened the Express Lane, our fastest growing product engine that serves as a key focal point of our Speed initiatives. This quarter, the Express Lane created a substantial impact by extending our in-line stories with new materials and colors, as the teams did with the Air Max 270 this quarter. And amplifying the brand concepts we know are connecting best with consumers, like the Tuned-Air Mercurial to celebrate World Cup, and capturing emerging trends, like we did in EMEA with a 90s-apparel collection where we identified the trend and quickly delivered product to market. Express Lane, as a whole, is leading to significantly stronger full-price sell-through rates. Through digital, we\u2019re also inventing new manufacturing tools that allow us to push the boundaries of product creation -- like computational design with React or new Flyknit apparel. And Automation throughout our supply chain continues to drive speed and efficiency. 2X Speed is a multi-year journey and while we\u2019ve made progress, we also know there\u2019s even greater opportunity ahead in this space. We\u2019ve closed out the fiscal year with a strong performance across our business. Being closer to the consumer and our new offense has us focused on the biggest growth opportunities, making the right investments with the greatest returns. We fueled increased demand for NIKE in fiscal \u201818. In fiscal \u201819, we\u2019ll continue that acceleration with an even faster pace of innovation and by serving consumers more completely across our entire portfolio. We have momentum, and we are continuing to transform across multiple dimensions and throughout our entire organization. And I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll use this quarter as a catalyst for growth into Fiscal \u201819 and beyond. Thanks. And now here\u2019s Andy. Andy Campion : Thank you, Mark and hello to everyone on the call. Fiscal year \u201818 was a strategically significant year for NIKE. As we began the fiscal year last June, we communicated our new strategy, the Consumer Direct Offense, which we believed would ignite NIKE\u2019s next horizon of strong, sustainable, profitable growth and transform the company in the process. Then, at our Investor Day. This past October, we showcased how our new strategy was already beginning to come to life. We displayed the pipeline of innovative products that we plan to bring to market in the second half of fiscal year \u201818 on our path to 2X Innovation. We immersed our stakeholders in the relaunch of our NIKE and SNKRS app experiences and the new membership services that would ignite 2X Direct. And we shared several of the manufacturing and supply chain initiatives that will help 2X our Speed and ultimately cut our time to market in half. Of course we also established a new long-term financial model. But, perhaps even more notable than the financial goals we established were some of the key operational measures of success that we shared. Those measures of success better define how we will transform NIKE into a digitally-led enterprise that connects more directly with our consumers globally through our key cities and countries. And as we now close Q4, we are thrilled to see our strategic execution, translating into strong financial performance, as both revenue growth and profitability exceeded even our own expectations. At the same time, what\u2019s even more exciting is that we also delivered across all of our key operational measures of success. And, it\u2019s worth highlighting a few examples, as these are proof points that NIKE\u2019s strategic transformation is underway at an accelerated pace. So first, we said that new innovation platforms will drive over 50% of our incremental growth over the next five years. In fiscal year \u201818, revenue from new innovative platforms actually drove over 80% of our incremental growth, fueled by innovative new platforms such as the Air VaporMax, React, the Air Max 270 and ZoomX. We also said that we would 2X Direct with Digital Commerce growth, both owned and partnered, comprising over 50% of NIKE\u2019s total company growth over the next five years. In fiscal year \u201818, NIKE Direct, in fact, drove over 90% of our growth and 100% of our growth was driven by the combination of NIKE Direct and partnered NIKE consumer experiences. NIKE Digital in particular grew 34% in Q4 on a constant currency basis and was the single fastest growing channel globally. Yet, from many of the hottest styles launched on NIKE Digital platforms within the quarter, our supply was only a fraction of the actual demand we experienced. This underscores a significant opportunity to better sense and serve digital demand in fiscal year \u201819. We also said in October that we expect our international geographies to drive over 75% of our growth and that North America would return to mid single digit growth over the next five years. For the full-year, our international geographies accounted for over 100% of our growth, with Greater China growing nearly 2X the rate of any other geography on a currency-neutral basis. And, in Q4, North America returned to growth, sharply reversing its prior trend. As Mark said, as we enter fiscal year \u201819, we are now running a more complete offense across our global portfolio. But, before I go deeper into our outlook for fiscal year \u201819, let\u2019s first reflect on the drivers of our strong Q4 results. NIKE, Inc. Q4 revenue increased 13%, up 8% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit international growth and a return to growth in North America. NIKE Direct led our growth globally, including 5% comp store growth and 34% digital growth. For the full-year, NIKE, Inc. revenue increased 6% to $36.4 billion, up 4% on a currency-neutral basis. Gross margin expanded over 60 basis points in Q4, exceeding our own expectations due to accelerating full-price sales and NIKE Digital growth. For the full-year, gross margin contracted just under 80 basis points, as strong underlying product profitability was more than offset by a 90 basis-point headwind from foreign exchange. Fourth quarter demand creation increased 25%, primarily driven by investments in new sports marketing assets such as Chelsea, Tottenham, and the NBA; brand marketing around key global sporting events such as the NBA Finals and the World Cup; and global campaigns supporting the launch of new product innovations. For the full-year, demand creation increased 7%. Operating overhead increased 14% for the quarter and 10% for the full-year as we are investing in capabilities that will fuel growth long-term, particularly with respect to digital and innovation. Our effective tax rate was 6.4% for the quarter and 55.3% for the full-year. The full-year rate was significantly higher than the prior year, primarily due to the one-time transition tax associated with U.S. Tax Reform. Fourth quarter Diluted EPS increased 15% to $0.69. Full-year diluted EPS declined 53% to $1.17, taking into account the significant one-time impacts of U.S. Tax Reform. As of May 31st, inventories were up 4%, growing slower than the rate of revenue growth, which is an indication that our supply and demand management efforts over the course of fiscal year \u201818 have returned NIKE to a strong pull market globally. Finally, today, we are announcing a new four-year, $15 billion share repurchase program. We anticipate that our current $12 billion share repurchase program will be completed within fiscal year \u201819. This new, expanded authorization, coupled with our dividend program, are evidence of NIKE\u2019s strong cash flow generation and steadily increasing cash returns to shareholders. Now, let\u2019s turn to the financial performance for a few of our reported operating segments. In North America, Q4 revenue grew 3% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, led by new innovation platforms, very strong Digital growth, continued momentum in Sportswear and broad growth across Apparel. We\u2019ve returned North America to revenue growth and expanding margins, and this healthy momentum is carrying forward into this new fiscal year. As we expected, Digital continues to reshape the consumer experience and to some extent disrupt the more undifferentiated, multibrand, wholesale dimensions of the marketplace. However, NIKE Consumer Experiences at retail, both owned and partnered, and particularly those that leverage a digital connection to the consumer, drove over two-thirds of our growth in North America. Digital connections have been critical to launching new and innovative products, creating brand heat, and better serving consumer demand. For example, as part of the Epic React launch, through social media, we invited our consumers to Choose Go. The Choose Go campaign inspired more than 1 million NIKE+ members to participate in a run on the NIKE Running Club app that day and generated over 500 million social media impressions. We also launched an exclusive colorway of the Epic React with Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods through a takeover of their Digital Commerce platform and social media channels. And, as Mark detailed, we\u2019re in the process of launching the NIKE app at retail in key markets bringing NIKE+ membership into the store and accelerating the convergence of digital and physical retail. As for the Jordan Brand in North America, we are already back to a pull market, and we expect a return to global growth in fiscal year \u201819. Consumers love the Jordan Brand and their passion for the brand is unwavering. At the same time, we saw an opportunity to recalibrate the supply of select styles across just distribution channels. While that included tightening the supply in some cases, it also included expanding the supply of the hottest, most iconic Jordan styles on the NIKE SNKRS app, which has fast become the leading destination for high heat footwear launches globally. We also leveraged both Jordan and NIKE launches on the SNKRS app to create compelling new consumer experiences that merge digital and physical with our strategic retail partners, for example, through initiatives such as Shock Drop, SNKRS Pass, and SNKRS Stash. Looking forward, we see tremendous opportunity to continue diversifying the Jordan Brand for Women, in performance, and through Apparel. For the full-year North America\u2019s revenue declined 2% and EBIT was 7% lower. However, our Q4 results in North America reflect a reversal of trend and sustainable momentum going into fiscal year \u201819. Moving to EMEA, where revenues grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis in Q4, driven by strong growth in Global Football, Sportswear, and Running. Our apparel business is also particularly strong across Europe, with Global Football apparel approaching triple digit growth in Q4 fueled by high-energy national team collections associated with the World Cup. In footwear, Air Max continues to be the dominant platform in the region, with the Air Max 270 becoming the number one style across key European markets and Air Max month in March propelling Sportswear to record full-year revenues. The NIKE Brand is also number one in all of our key cities across Europe, fueled by campaigns such as Nothing Beats a Londoner that amplified the authentic voice of over 200 London consumers along with influencers such as Skepta and several of the world\u2019s greatest athletes including Mo Farah, Harry Kane and others. This was a great example of a hyperlocal city campaign that resonated with our consumers globally. While NIKE Direct continues to lead all dimensions of growth in EMEA, JD, for example, has also been a very strategic partner for NIKE. JD continues to leverage digital connections with consumers and differentiated store concepts, including size, to both create and serve demand. And we look forward to the best practices that they will bring to the North America marketplace For the full-year, currency-neutral revenue growth was 9%, fueled by double-digit growth in Sportswear and across Apparel. On a reported basis, fiscal year \u201818 revenues grew 16% and EBIT increased 5% as strong revenue growth was offset primarily by transactional FX headwinds on gross margin. So, next, let\u2019s turn to Greater China. In Q4, Greater China\u2019s growth accelerated to 25% on a currency-neutral basis, including strong double-digit growth across all categories, the Jordan Brand and across our Women\u2019s business. NIKE Digital growth continues to outpace all other marketplace dimensions, and we continue to partner with and learn from China\u2019s leading digital platforms. Through our partnership with Tmall, our first ever Air Max Super Brand Day in March became our largest day on the platform second only to Singles Day for the year. And with Tencent, we launched our Choose Go campaign through digital media, inspiring 2 million runners to participate in a seven-week running journey and creating strong demand for the Epic React. For the full-year, revenues in Greater China increased 18% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by Running, Sportswear, the Jordan Brand, and NIKE Basketball. On a reported basis, fiscal year \u201818 revenues were up 21% and EBIT increased 20%. There are several drivers of the extraordinary long-term growth potential we see in Greater China, from favorable macroeconomics, to the rise of sport and fitness, to the scale and impact of Digital, to the strength of the NIKE Brand. Accordingly, we will continue to invest to extend our leadership in this strategically important and fast-growing market. In APLA, Q4 revenue grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was strong across all key countries within this diverse geography and is being fueled by our focus on creating brand energy in key cities and through digital. In fact, while NIKE Digital growth was strong in every geography, APLA\u2019s digital growth led the pack. In addition to strong NIKE Direct Digital growth, growth through new, entrepreneurial digital partners also accelerated. Looking forward, we will continue to drive digital momentum by scaling the NIKE and SNKRS apps across key countries within APLA, while also continuing to explore and scale these digital partnerships. For the full fiscal year, revenue increased 10% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by balanced growth across all categories, including the Jordan Brand and our Women\u2019s business. On a reported basis, full-year revenues for the fiscal year increased 9%, while EBIT was up 21%, reflecting gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. And finally, at Converse, revenue declined 11% on a currency-neutral basis for fiscal year \u201818 and declined 14% in the fourth quarter. Contraction was primarily driven by the decision to right-size wholesale distribution in North America and EMEA. At the same time, Converse Direct grew double-digits in Q4, including strong double-digit growth in Digital for the full-year with acceleration in Q4. On a reported basis, full-year revenues were down 8% and EBIT declined 35%. As we move into fiscal year \u201819, we are reigniting energy in the Converse Brand, and diversifying Converse\u2019s product portfolio, both through Converse\u2019s authentic positioning in sport and through new sportswear styles and collaborations. In fiscal year \u201819, Converse will also launch a more direct, branded and immersive digital experience to drive closer connections between the Converse Brand and its passionate consumers. Fiscal year \u201819 will be the first full-year of execution against NIKE\u2019s Consumer Direct Offense and the long-term financial goals that we detailed at our Investor Day. As we are now deeper into execution of our new offense, it is becoming increasingly clear that Digital is transforming how we operate, and will favorably reshape our economic model over the long term. Digital is inflecting our revenue growth and has a favorable mix impact on our gross margin as we capture more of the value that we are creating for consumers. And, as for SG&A, we will continue to accelerate investment in scalable digital experiences and capabilities, building both organically and through acquisitions. At the same time, we are already seeing how upfront investments in experiences, like the NIKE and SNKRS apps, and in capabilities, such as data and analytics, can be efficiently leveraged globally to better serve our consumers across our key markets. Finally, digital also creates the potential for win-win economic models with our wholesale partners over time as they transform their retail experiences to serve the next generation of digitally native consumers. Taking all of these dynamics into account, we are updating our guidance for fiscal year \u201819. As of our last earnings call, we expected mid-to-high-single-digit revenue growth in fiscal year \u201819. As we now close Q4, our expectations for revenue growth in fiscal year \u201819 have moved up slightly, entering the high-single-digit range. This improved outlook takes into account building consumer demand for NIKE. However, we are also mindful of renewed FX volatility and the strengthening dollar of late. As for gross margin, we now expect expansion of roughly 50 basis points or slightly greater, fueled by strong full-price sales, expanding average selling prices, and growth in our NIKE Direct businesses, partially offset by higher input costs. As for SG&A, we will continue to prioritize investment in new digital consumer experiences and capabilities, in product innovation and in brand marketing. As such, in fiscal year \u201819, we expect SG&A to grow roughly in the same range as revenue growth. We are not targeting SG&A leverage in fiscal year \u201819. We are capturing productivity gains within SG&A, but we will use that incremental capacity to invest strategically for the long-term. As for other expense, net of interest expense, we expect roughly $125 million to $150 million of expense for the full year. We see our effective tax rate being in the mid-teens range or potentially slightly higher for the full-year. It\u2019s important to note that our tax rate will continue to be volatile based upon the full implementation and further guidance with respect to U.S. Tax Reform. Variation in our mix of earnings geographically, will also have an impact as will be impact of stock-based compensation, and other discrete items. Our focus will remain on driving strategic transformation and delivering strong growth over the long-term, more so than on the results in any individual quarter. That said, for some additional context as we enter the fiscal year, we expect the same level of revenue growth in Q1 as we do for the full-year. We also expect less gross margin expansion in the first half as compared to the second half of the year. And, finally, as for SG&A, our investments will be more front-loaded towards the first half of the fiscal year driven by key consumer and sports moments such as the World Cup. The Consumer Direct Offense is transforming how we operate at NIKE and how we will create value for shareholders going forward. More specifically, Digital is proving to be as transformative as we expected, and potentially even more so. We still have much work to do ahead of us to realize the full potential of our new offense; that said, it is clear as we accelerate into fiscal year \u201819 that we have now ignited NIKE\u2019s next horizon of strong, sustainable, profitable growth. With that, we\u2019ll now open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Drbul from Guggenheim. Your line is open. Bob Drbul : Hi, guys. Good afternoon. I guess, the question that I have is on the North American market, you talk a lot about the sustainability of the growth in the U.S. Can you just -- as you look for the -- throughout the next fiscal year, in terms of -- is expectation for like the low single-digit increase, is it expected to accelerate based on what you're seeing? I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit more around the outlook in the North American market. Andy Campion : Sure. We do see sustainable momentum in North America. As you know, our investor day guidance for North America was that we believe it was a mid single digit growth market over the next five years. And so, we don\u2019t typically provide geographical specific guidance, certainly by quarter or for the full-year. But I would say that we have momentum going into the year, and that's really primarily fueled by new innovation platform that we are scaling, NIKE Direct, certainly NIKE Digital which accelerated to well over 30% growth, driven by strong results on SNKRS and through the membership. And then, I\u2019d note that importantly, we have returned North America to healthy pull market. Inventory is clean, up only 2%; full price sales are accelerating; off price sales are declining; and gross margins are expanding. So, we do see strong momentum, sustainable momentum going in to fiscal year \u201819, but we aren't providing specific guidance by a line item by geography. Mark Parker : And much of what you saw in terms of Q4 in terms of the momentum that has been building, we'll see that continue throughout the fiscal year. And I'll put an exclamation point on the products as being a driving force beyond just executing some of the basics better across the board. Bob Drbul : Okay, great. And I just have a follow-up question I think for Mark. The LeBron Watch, can you just give us some insight into where you expect LeBron to land in free agency this year? Mark Parker : I'm not going there. I think, wherever he goes, he's going to help his team more than anybody else, I think in the league. So he's -- yes, everybody wants to know that question but I can't give you any more insight. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kate McShane from Citi. Your line is open. Kate McShane : Hi. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. My question's centered around Jordan. You made a couple of comments in the prepared comments about the brand. But, I was curious, could you remind us now like you're back into the pull model, how big that business is in terms of dollars? And could you also maybe walk us through size of a retro versus the marquee business, and if there's been any significant change in the pricing structure within Jordan? Andy Campion : Yes. Kate, if you refer to our earnings release, this is the time of the year where we actually report our revenue by category. And what you would see in the release is Jordan brand for the 12 months ended this fiscal year was about $2.85 billion. Mark Parker : Sorry, Kate. Can you repeat the second part of that question related to pricing? Kate McShane : Just if there was any change in the structure of the pricing, now that you're back to the pull model for the brand? Mark Parker : From a pricing perspective, I'd say that the leading indicator in terms of the strength of the Jordan brand is that we're seeing strong full price [ph] sales. In fact, it might be an understatement to say that our inventories are clean in North America. And that was not a result of adjusting prices. That was entirely about right sizing supply and within distribution channels. And what we've seen is that certainly with respect to the hottest styles and the most iconic styles, we've had extraordinary demand, again the demand that outpaced the supply that we had planned, particularly with respect to our digital experiences like the SNKRS approximately. So, we continue to feel that there's great price value there and certainly as we bring innovation and storytelling to those icons and across the rest of the Jordan line. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Merriman from Bernstein. Your line is open. Jamie Merriman : Thank you very much. I had two questions related to digital. Andy, you talked about the investments that you're making in digital and the visibility that you have in terms of the results that is delivering. Can you talk a little bit about how you think about the ultimate opportunities from a profitability prospective, as that business does scale? And then, the second part would be, you mentioned Tmall I think really setting the bar in terms of your digital partners. You didn\u2019t talk about Amazon. And so I\u2019m just wondering if there are learnings from the Tmall relationship that you could work with Amazon to apply or if there is an opportunity there? Thank you. Andy Campion : Sure. I will off start with your question around the impacts of Digital. It\u2019s a great question and a timely question. As both, Mark and I detailed, we saw acceleration in Digital that quite frankly exceeded even our own expectations. It wasn\u2019t by accident, we have certainly been investing both organically in digital experiences such as some of the experiences we have shared with respect to our membership initiatives as well as in capabilities. You\u2019ve heard us refer to our acquisitions of Virgin Mega, Invertex and Zodiac over time. And so that acceleration is definitely a result of the investments. In terms of our evolving view of the impact of Digital on our economic model or how we create value for shareholders, we do see Digital being a platform that helps us better optimize supply and demand. We obviously get a very direct read and signals from consumers in terms of which products they are most interested in, and that ultimately helps us amplify revenue growth through full price sales. When we're leveraging digital in a more direct way, we obviously capture more of that revenue at the retail price. When we are leveraging digital with our partners, we do see a benefit from a full price sales and win-win relationship with our partners. Digital Commerce also has margins that are favorable from a mix perspective relative to our traditional wholesale brick-and-mortar business. From an SG&A perspective, I would suggest there are two ways to look at it. One is short, medium and long term, and then the other one is specifically more in the shorter term. I think short, medium and long term, what we\u2019re finding is that the capabilities or experiences we\u2019re building in digital are very scalable and they are scalable in efficient way. You think about creating experiences around the SNKRS or NIKE apps, and to the extent we have success in the markets where we launched that we\u2019re then able to take that investment we\u2019ve already made and leverage it in markets around the world. And we\u2019re certainly seeing that for example with the SNKRS app, which is number one in Japan. In terms of free applications, we\u2019ve seen millions of downloads of that app since launch in China, leveraging a lot of that upfront initial investment. So, we think it's a source of leverage. At the same time, because we\u2019re focused on long-term and we do think digital has the ability to really inflect our value creation. We\u2019re accelerating investments that we\u2019re making in digital now to accelerate as down that path. Mark Parker : And quickly on Amazon, I would just say that our partnership is progressing well. We remain focused on elevating the consumer experience on the platform, we\u2019re learning a lot, applying, and you mentioned Tmall, we did call that, partnership out in our prepared remarks, Tmall has been an exceptional partner for us. I think, the main focus is on elevating the brand profile and experience on the platform, and that will continue to be the focus as we explore next steps with the Amazon. And I'll call out our other digital platform partners to Zalando and Asos, and some of the others I mentioned earlier, this is a critical part of our digital opportunity going forward beyond what we're doing direct. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Duffy from Stifel. Your line is open. Jim Duffy : One of the things that jumped out of me from the call is that notable success you're having in capitalizing on sneaker culture for women. How far are you down the runway on this and can you highlight some things to look for in fiscal \u201819 and beyond? Mark Parker : Well, I would say that we're in the early stages here. To be frank, the demand that we've created from our SNKRS app has greatly exceeded our expectations and done so quickly both for men and for women. This is -- I mentioned this before but one of the biggest upside opportunities, I think we have over the course of fiscal \u201819 and beyond. The response has been phenomenal, and it's truly an area that we\u2019re excited about catching up, meeting end-to-end, being in a position to serve that incredible increase in demand that we've got from sneakers and the whole sneaker culture which is now a global and connected community that is creating again incredible buzz around the world and incredible demand. In some way, it's just a great problem to have but we've got a lot of upside opportunity here. Jim Duffy : And then, Mark, levering data, clearly a focus, where are you do you think in the process of providing data to some of the upstream operating units like design and demand planning and putting them in a position to use that data to inform business decisions? Mark Parker : Yes. That\u2019s a great question I'd say we're on the early stages. I mean, this is a constantly moving opportunity for us, design and product creation and the express line, the supply chain they are all connecting digitally; it's predictive demand planning -- sensing and demand planning is absolutely a critical part of advancing this capability moving forward. I feel like we're making a tremendous product - or progress in that respect. I think this next fiscal year will be an acceleration, the use of data to inform product design and capabilities going forward. And then, it's actually impacting how we do our -- manage our supply chain in our manufacturing flexibility in response time. So, I think you'll see a lot of scaling of the data and analytics capabilities for NIKE here in the months and quarters ahead. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel from Nomura Instinet. Your line is open. Simeon Siegel : Just looking further out over that multiyear mid single digit North America number, is there any color you could share on how you view footwear and apparel in any distinction there in terms of how you see the competitive dynamic? Thank you. Mark Parker : Yes. Actually, we see strength across both product types, footwear and apparel, both are competitive, market sizes for NIKE in North America but around the world. The health of the business both on the footwear and the apparel side is actually quite strong, and demand that we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re equally focused on innovation, both in performance and lifestyle, and footwear and apparel. But, we see the results that we\u2019ve rated I think in Q4 and the momentum it\u2019s building. We\u2019ll see that continue throughout the fiscal year, very bullish on both footwear and apparel, both performance and certainly Sportswear. Andy Campion : I\u2019ll just note that in the quarter, in North America, the return to growth was fuelled by growth in both footwear and apparel with a slightly faster rate of growth in apparel and part of that rate of growth was impacted by our new partnership with the NBA and Mark referenced some of the new styles that we brought the assortment with the NBA and then more broadly across our line in basketball. Mark Parker : And I\u2019ll mention too, it\u2019s across both men's and women\u2019s. Women\u2019s is a major growth area for NIKE, in both footwear, we mentioned SNKRS, and the sportswear success that we\u2019re seeing, but likewise in apparel, again particularly in the sportswear area. Simeon Siegel : And so, to the point -- and to the point about the digital strength, do you see any distinction between apparel and footwear online as that business grows or is it broad-based? Mark Parker : It\u2019s actually fairly broad based. We see it both in physical and digital, direct, and wholesale. But certainly on the footwear side, we\u2019re seeing incredible spikes in demand as I mentioned with our Direct business, particularly around the SNKRS mobile approximately, and again, expect that to continue. On the apparel side, I think it\u2019s more balanced. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Svezia from Wedbush. Your line is open. Chris Svezia : I guess, just first, western Europe, just curious beyond the World Cup, what\u2019s your ability to maintain some of the momentum you\u2019re seeing, whether it\u2019s in footwear or apparel, maybe any color by region, digital or DTC, just sort of what you\u2019re seeing in that market, that might give you some confidence that that momentum can continue, once you get through the World Cup event? Mark Parker : Yes. I think the underlying health of the business for NIKE in Europe is actually quite strong, beyond what we\u2019re seeing in World Cup, and again, I think that\u2019s both in footwear and apparel. Similarly to the North America, we have a clean marketplace seeing growing full-price sales, we\u2019re outpacing the marketplace, overall. It\u2019s the same dynamics. New product innovation is resonating, especially in the some of the key styles we mentioned like the Air Max franchise, the Air Max 270, the VaporMax. We\u2019re editing our product mix, we\u2019re creating more choice, but focusing on key products, and that\u2019s really helping to drive our strength in the marketplace. I think the focus too on the key cities, with hyperlocal products, and a lot of it\u2019s fuelled by Express line, it\u2019s really clicking into gear in Europe. So, we\u2019re over-indexing Europe. And again, beyond the World Cup, we expect that to continue. Chris Svezia : And Andy for you, you outperformed Q4 on the gross margin. You guided to roughly 50 basis points for fiscal year \u201819, but it seems like some of the drivers are accelerating around products, favorable channel mix, and I believe also FX starts to become an incremental tailwind here. Can you just maybe just walk through with other pieces we might be missing that go into that gross margin to get through our product cost? But any color around that will be helpful. Andy Campion : Sure. As I said, we see strong gross margin expansion in fiscal year \u201819, you know that our long-term financial model is to deliver as much as 50 basis points as expansion. And we have updated that outlook to be 50 basis points or slightly greater that\u2019s led by stronger full price selling as well as over-indexing growth in our higher margin NIKE Direct businesses. While FX headwinds are now behind us, we are not forecasting significant FX tailwinds based on current rates. And based on FX volatility being renewed of late, we are being measured in that regard even as we look at to the second half of the year. We are forecasting, as you noted a bit of pressure on gross margin from select input cost headwinds within labor, oil, freight materials. And I should note that our margins -- within our margins different than many of our peers, we capture a significant portion of our supply chain costs, where some of our peers capture those costs in SG&A. And so, as we're investing to 2X Speed, we do have some investments in revolutionizing manufacturing and other initiatives that are in that line item of our P&L. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Matt McClintock Barclays. Your line is open. Matt McClintock : Andy, I wanted to follow up on something that you said in your remarks. You said supply was only a fraction of the demand, and that sounds like a pretty good problem to have. But, I was wondering, in the content of 2X Speed as you were just saying, how do we think about optimizing the total value or the total projected value of a new shoe or new sneaker in a world where you have 2X Speed and consumer demand is changing at accelerating rate? Andy Campion : Yes. As you put it -- I think, you said it was a nice problem to have. We see it as a great opportunity to really serve the consumers who have extraordinary demand for that product better. So, frankly, along the lines of -- the notion of 2X Speed, we are attacking that opportunity with a lot of urgency, not just because it is a revenue upside potential driver which it certainly is. As I said, the supply that we had, again, some of the demand we saw on some of the hottest styles was as I said a fraction of that demand. We also see it as a great opportunity to both serve in terms of product they want but also connect in a deeper way with passionate consumers, many call them sneaker heads who have chosen to connect with us as members on the NIKE app and SNKRS. In terms of 2X Speed, I think maybe even elevating, as Mark said, the digital transformation at NIKE is really an end to end notion. And when we think about demand sensing, the greatest opportunity we have is to sense the demand and even in a more nuance way, the signals and the preferences from the consumers that we are connecting with directly on SNKRS. We use things like notify me initiative, draws, preorders and we are coming up increasingly with even more creative ways to get a sense for how robust the demand is, either for specific products or for types of products that we may be planning to bring to market. Nitesh Sharan : Great. Thank you, Matt. Again, thank you everyone for joining us today. I'd like to again just apologize for the technical difficulties we had earlier. We were receiving some noisy feedback. It was a great quarter though. So, if you have some business related feedback or questions related to that feel free to reach out to the Investor Relations team. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So, we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event, you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to requeue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker. Mark Parker : Thanks, Nitesh, and hello and good afternoon, everyone. Last quarter, we described the growing momentum in our business, and in Q1 that momentum continued at a strong pace. We\u2019re capitalizing on the opportunities we see in the near term and we\u2019re diving deeper into the areas that will widen NIKE\u2019s advantages over the long term. Through the Consumer Direct Offense, we\u2019re taking a winning formula and executing it across our complete portfolio and it\u2019s leading to the balanced growth that you see today. For the quarter, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 10% on a reported basis. Specific highlights include double-digit growth in our international geographies and 6% growth in North America. NIKE Digital is leading the way for differentiated retail, up 36% for the quarter. And we saw acceleration in both our sportswear and performance businesses. While this quarter\u2019s success was broad-based and we\u2019re pleased with our momentum, we know we have even more opportunities ahead. As we\u2019ve described before, a key focus that will create separation for NIKE over the long term is our digital transformation. Ultimately, it\u2019s about becoming more personal at scale. And put simply, it\u2019s how digital is accelerating each of our Triple Double pillars. And that\u2019s how we create through 2X Innovation, how we connect through 2X Direct and how we serve through 2X Speed. So, let\u2019s look at the quarter through each of these lenses. The success we\u2019re seeing today starts with great products. It\u2019s ultimately where the consumer cast their vote. Our innovation platforms are building a foundation for growth over many years. As the taste of our consumers shifts faster, strong platforms allow us to continually bring fresh products to market while extending our storytelling and investments. We\u2019re seeing it with NIKE Air and React. Consumers are drawn to their comfort and performance and they\u2019re asking for more style options. VaporMax and 270 are both proven there is still vast growth potential in NIKE Air as we develop more comfort innovation in new forms. This spring, we\u2019re taking the exaggerated air you see in the Air Max 270 and going a step further with the introduction of the Air Max 720. This new platform is engineered for maximum comfort, cradling the entire foot. And the Air Max 27 -- or 720 is distinctly NIKE and will deliver it to consumers in early 2019. NIKE React is a great example of how we\u2019ve capitalized on the appeal of performance innovation and immediately scaled it into sportswear. The React Element 87 is considered one of the industry\u2019s top new designs, and we\u2019ve applied the comfort of React cushioning to more performance and lifestyle shoes at several price points. ZoomX continues to power the world\u2019s fastest runners including Eliud Kipchoge during his epic world record smashing run at the Berlin Marathon this month. This quarter, we took the magic of the Vaporfly 4% and merged it with an iconic running shoe, creating the Peg Turbo. The launch has created incredible energy for the whole Pegasus franchise and helped lead our overall running business to solid growth this quarter. One of our most versatile and ever-advancing platforms is Flyknit. Through digital knitting, we can now place breathability, stretch and support exactly where we need it. In basketball, for example, the KD11 and the LeBron 16, each leverage specific yarns and different knit structures to match individual athlete needs. The LeBron 16 with its Battleknit 2.0 has had a great early read with consumers, both men and women. As part of our broader commitment to scale sustainable platforms, we\u2019re expanding NIKE Flyleather through iconic styles like the Air Force 1, Cortez and the Air Max 95. Flyleather is a super material that looks and feels like premium leather, but it\u2019s lighter, more durable and more sustainable. It uses at least 50% reclaimed leather and helps eliminate waste. And in the coming year, for the first time ever, NIKE will bring digitally powered adjustable footwear to professional sports. Building on the auto-lacing platform from HyperAdapt, this breakthrough creates a custom fit. We had a group of elite athletes on campus this summer for an intense wear test. And their feedback was that they never felt more secure or more in control of their movement. This next generation adaptable innovation will set the standard for optimal fit. And we\u2019ll offer it at more accessible price points and in greater quantities. In addition to platforms, we\u2019re executing the fundamentals across our categories at a high level right now. We know that it\u2019s newness and freshness that wins with the consumer today. So, with our edit-to-amplify approach, we\u2019re providing deeper assortments and greater options of our top sellers. Our footwear power franchises, for example, consistently outperform our overall footwear sell through.  Apparel too continued its momentum with 11% growth, driven by fleece, tops and bottoms, jackets and pants. We delivered a number of sportswear apparel collections over the last 90 days like the City Ready and the Metallic Sheen collections in women, and NIKE Sport and Tech Pack and ACG. We\u2019ll continue on this path and extending the performance because collections give consumers more complete looks and allow for better merchandising and storytelling. Overall with apparel in our categories, we saw a consistent sell-through of our football national teams collections drafting off the energy we created from the World Cup, where we had our first all-NIKE men\u2019s final. The growth in our women\u2019s apparel business was led by sportswear and sports bras, where our strategy to blend style and comfort is working. And in NIKE Basketball apparel, we\u2019re capturing the excitement for LeBron\u2019s move to the Lakers. As you\u2019ll see in just a few weeks, we\u2019re bringing more creative designs with the NBA City jerseys this year. When we look across our complete portfolio of products, we still see areas with significant upside. We\u2019ve talked before about the opportunity in women in Young Athletes and Jordan. Delivering innovation and fresh product in these areas brings balance to our portfolio. A strong roster of core footwear at entry price points is equally important to NIKE\u2019s overall growth potential. We\u2019re not yet where we want to be in core footwear, particularly in North America. But two priorities for the business are to develop innovation specifically for the core consumer and to better leverage pinnacle performance platforms like NIKE Air in this zone. Another product strategy that\u2019s driving incredible energy is our ability to create unique intersections between sport and style across our brand. A few examples over this past quarter include the on and off court collaboration between Serena and Virgil Abloh for the U.S. Open; Converse\u2019s limited edition Chuck Taylors and One Stars with creative partners in fashion and music; and our first Jordan Brand football kit with PSG. As I said before, it\u2019s not lifestyle versus performance or fashion versus sports, the consumer continues to be inspired by seeing those worlds come together. Overall, 2X Innovation is at the heart of our continued momentum right now. We have versatile platforms; we\u2019re mixing sport and style in unexpected ways; and we have a deep line-up across our product portfolio that\u2019s creating value across all dimensions of our business. And while our product innovation is fueling demand, our 2X Direct strategy is driving new ways to connect with our consumers. It\u2019s building confidence in our vision for smart retail, where we remove friction and personalize experiences through the intersection of digital and physical environments. 2X Direct is in the early stages, and it\u2019s already creating an impact, resulting in strong growth and margin expansion for our NIKE Direct channels. We continue to see unprecedented demand for our highest heat product through our SNKRS app, which has become the world\u2019s number one footwear shopping app. And we\u2019ll continue to expand the reach of SNKRS, launching in Mexico, Brazil and Southeast Asia next quarter. The NIKE Live retail concept, we unveiled with our Melrose store in LA was incredibly successful this quarter. The premise behind the concept is to create a live and ever-changing experience. We\u2019re testing a number of new features including product assortments that update frequently based on what\u2019s trending with the local consumer; a service that allows consumers to reserve an item on our apps and then pick it up curbside or in the store from a personal smart locker. And through Swoosh text, our store athletes can now provide expert advice for consumers after they\u2019ve left the store. And what we\u2019re learning in Melrose, we\u2019re bringing to 2 new flagship stores in our 2 most important key cities, New York and Shanghai this next quarter. Both will be the combination of all we\u2019ve learned about personalized and experiential shopping over the last several years. There\u2019ll be incredible showcases for the NIKE brand. Our obsession with the store experience is also paying off with top strategic partners. While retail consolidation has not finished its course in North America, our growing NIKE consumer experiences with Foot Locker, Nordstrom and other key partners are already driving higher growth rates as compared to non-differentiated doors. We\u2019re equally energized by the momentum we\u2019re building with new digital commerce partners. We just moved from a pilot stage to a fully operational program with Flipkart in India. And 2 weeks ago, we announced a new partnership with Jet.com to sell selected assortment of both NIKE and Converse in key cities in North America. With Jet, we\u2019re partnering to develop consumer insights and create a better branded experience on their platform. And we\u2019re doing same with our key partners in China. This quarter, we made it possible to combine NikePlus member accounts to Tmall accounts. We\u2019re seeing an impressive increase in new members in China as a result. And lastly, we launched partnership with WeChat, making 1 billion monthly active users just one click away from becoming a NikePlus member. Ultimately companies will be judged on their ability to be more personal with their consumers at scale. And NIKE\u2019s taking a lead on this promise, leveraging more insights from all over the world and reshaping the shopping experience through smart retail. To make that a reality, we\u2019re unlocking opportunities to quickly and seamlessly design, manufacture and deliver our products to consumers through 2X Speed. We\u2019re sharpening our sensing capabilities and develop a fully responsive product manufacturing. We\u2019re actively building a portfolio of innovation and automation that impacts the entire spectrum of our process. Our goals are ambitious and we have high standards. Our vision is to leverage automation to deliver amazing innovative products, faster and more responsively, while being more sustainable and cost efficient. And we\u2019ve had some great success. For example, we invented a flat assembly process for uppers in our Advanced Product Creation Center at our World Headquarters using 30% fewer steps and 50% less labor. We tested this process with our partners including Flex and in our Asia store space as well. Transforming traditional footwear manufacturing is a significant undertaking. We\u2019ve learned a lot and are building new high-impact capabilities, yet we continue to face specific challenges together with our partners including Flex where the goal has been to deliver responsive, automated, close to market manufacturing of high-quality product at scale. This is a dynamic process and we\u2019re continually assessing and refining the best path forward, leveraging our breakthroughs in areas like rapid prototyping, 3D and digital printing, and new methods of make all in service of cutting the overall product creation cycle in half. Another key initiative accelerating us towards that goal is the Express Lane, which continues to be the engine that\u2019s creating the most agility in our supply chain right now. We\u2019re driving double-digit growth in many of our key cities through the Express Lane as we capitalize on the local energy for key icons like the Cortez and sports moments like the World Cup. With this end-to-end view, our entire value chain, we\u2019re delivering the right product to the right consumer in the right moment. And across product lines, through GOs [ph] and with our partners around the world, we\u2019re relentlessly driving speed at a scale that is creating impact for our business. We\u2019re off to a great start in Q1, managing the dynamic environment. More importantly, we\u2019re setting a new foundation for long-term, sustainable growth for years to come. Thanks. And now, here is Andy. Andy Campion : Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. We are extremely pleased with the quality of the growth that we delivered in the first quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, we are delivering stronger, more broad-based momentum around the world than the expectations we set entering the fiscal year. We had continued strong growth in international markets, led by Greater China growing at 20%, and our international growth is now being amplified by very strong, sustainable growth in North America. As for the quality of our growth, our momentum continues to be directly tied to execution of the Consumer Direct Offense and more specifically, the Triple Double. First, take, for example, our 2X Direct initiative. 2X Direct is about connecting the NIKE brand more directly to our consumers. And today, the most direct connection to the consumer is through the mobile device in the palm of their hand. In Q1, we continued to enhance and expand our NIKE Digital ecosystem, leading with mobile, and the result was 36% NIKE Digital growth. NIKE Digital was once again our fastest growing channel in each and every geography. Now, while NIKE Digital is leading the way, we believe physical retail will also play an important role in doubling our direct connection to consumers. We see growth in the physical environment being driven by smarter retail, experiences that leverage digital technology to better serve consumers. In Q1, our vision for physical retail became more tangible. We continued to roll out what we\u2019re calling the NIKE app at retail, starting with our own in line stores. And we also launched a new concept called NIKE Live. The NIKE Live concept came to life in Q1 through the opening of NIKE by Melrose in Los Angeles. NIKE Live leverages our NikePlus membership platform and other digitally enabled services to provide a truly differentiated consumer experience at retail. The results to-date have been phenomenal. For example, at NIKE by Melrose, the conversion of in-store shoppers into digital NikePlus members is 6 times higher than in the rest of our fleet, as consumers seek to gain the full benefits associated with being more directly connected to NIKE. Our approach has been to task, learn and then scale new concepts such as these. Accordingly, we\u2019re now in the process of scaling these new concepts across our fleet of own stores. And these tangible proof points are also accelerating new concept development with our strategic wholesale partners. 2X Innovation is another key pillar within the Consumer Direct Offense that is fueling our broad-based momentum. Suffice it to say that our recently launched innovation platforms VaporMax, Air Max 270, React and ZoomX have already generated in aggregate over $2 billion in revenue at retail. Further, these platforms are driving brand distinction and catalyzing growth across our broader product portfolio in both performance and sportswear. For example, as Mark noted, the new innovation we are bringing to the NIKE Air franchise has ignited double-digit growth across our multibillion dollar family of NIKE Air products. Newness and innovation are also favorably impacting our gross margin, as our full price sell-through is significantly outpacing off-price sales. Our current inventory levels are also tight in relation to the strong demand that we\u2019re creating. Underlying our strategic momentum is the digital transformation of NIKE that Mark mentioned. A year ago, we aligned our teams around the world on our new strategy, the Consumer Direct Offense. Over the past year, we\u2019ve been ramping up investment in the new digital capabilities that will reshape how we operate at NIKE for the long term. Our investments in new digital capabilities are coming in the form of both organic development and acquisitions. As we closed fiscal year \u201818, we announced the acquisitions of Zodiac and Invertex, both of which are already having a profound impact on how we better serve consumers. Another acquisition that we made back in fiscal year \u201817 was Virgin Mega. That team has now become known as Studio 23 at digital hub in New York that\u2019s driving the explosive growth of the SNKRS app. Within fiscal year \u201819, we\u2019re also investing significantly in the organic development of new capabilities, including digital demand sensing, consumer data and analytics, connected inventory, digital product design and creation, a digital content engine and a new enterprise resource platform that will help unlock speed and flexibility in our supply chain. As our long-term financial model implies, we believe that NIKE\u2019s unrivaled scale and resources afford us the ability to over-index on investment in these differentiating capabilities, while still delivering expanding profitability over the five-year horizon. Execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is clearly beginning to transform NIKE\u2019s business model and how we will create value for shareholders over the long term. So, let\u2019s recap our Q1 results in a bit more detail with a focus on how strategic execution is the driving force behind our current financial performance. NIKE, Inc. Q1 revenue increased 10%, up 9% on a currency-neutral basis. Our stronger than projected currency-neutral growth was driven by acceleration in North America and continued strong momentum in international markets, albeit slightly offset by FX dynamics within the quarter. Our growth across geographies was led by NIKE Direct with NIKE Direct growing 12% and NIKE Digital growing 34% on a currency-neutral basis. The impact of innovation, NIKE Digital growth outpacing all other channels, and our tighter supply and demand management also fueled roughly 50 basis points of NIKE, Inc.\u2019s gross margin expansion in Q1. Demand creation grew 13% in the first quarter, primarily driven by sports marketing investments, as well as brand campaigns that amplified key moment sport such as the World Cup. Operating overhead increased 5%, driven by investments in digital capabilities, as well as in our supply chain and enterprise technology platforms. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14%, which reflects the implementation of U.S. tax reform. First quarter diluted earnings per share increased 18% to $0.67. Finally, as of August 31st, inventories reflect to prior year, primarily driven by a strong pull market across all geographies, coupled with the efforts we\u2019ve taken over the past year to right size supply. So, now, let\u2019s turn to the financial performance for our reported operating segments. In North America, we have returned to strong sustainable growth. Q1 revenue grew 6% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, led by a accelerating growth across both footwear and apparel, driven by new innovation platforms as well as strong owned and partnered digital growth. Wholesale has also returned to growth, yet we see even greater opportunity to drive differentiation across the wholesale marketplace going forward, in part by leveraging our learnings from the NIKE app at retail and NIKE by Melrose. Another growth opportunity we see ahead of us in North America relates the Jordan Brand. In the second half of fiscal year \u201818, we tightened supply. We also reset our approach to Jordan Retro, creating more current stories and collaborations with respect to Jordan\u2019s most iconic styles. We\u2019re now bringing those icons to life in more compelling ways for the new generation of Jordan consumers. And as a result, the Jordan Brand is back to a pull market.  We\u2019re also beginning to have greater dimension for the Jordan Brand, for example for women, we\u2019re extending sizes and the icons we know they already love and also creating silhouettes and new collaborations made specifically for her. Apparel and performance basketball also represents significant growth opportunities going forward. As the football and basketball seasons ramp up, our brand momentum will continue to build in North America. At the same time, we\u2019re not taking that momentum for granted. We continue to identify and attack opportunities to elevate our game and drive strong, sustainable growth in this important geography. So, now, let\u2019s turn to EMEA. In EMEA, Q1 revenue grew 9% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong growth in sportswear and healthy growth in Running and Jordan. NIKE Digital led all dimensions of the marketplace, growing at a strong double-digit rate. One of the underlying drivers of our sustained growth in EMEA is the strength of our brand across this diverse geography. EMEA accounted 5 of our 12 key global cities, and in all 5 of those key cities in EMEA, NIKE is rated number one by consumers, and our growth is over-indexing in the broader market. By connecting more deeply with consumers in key influential cities and by amplifying the biggest moments in sport, NIKE is creating increasingly greater distinction as a brand in Europe. One of those sports moments was the incredibly exciting World Cup in which both of the finalists were NIKE teams. And soon after the World Cup final, we launched our Awaken the Phantom campaign, generating over 50 million views in the first few weeks and driving strong sell through on the launch of our newest global footwall franchise, the Phantom. And finally, after celebrating the French National Team\u2019s World Cup victory, we continue to bring energy to global football with the launch of a Jordan branded Paris Saint-German team kit and collection of apparel. That launch has been phenomenal with the key style selling out immediately. While NIKE has become the leading brand in EMEA, we are far from having achieved our full potential. We see the opportunity to both grow the market for athletic footwear and apparel across Europe, and also create even greater separation from the competition as a brand. That is why we believe we can sustain the strong growth in EMEA over the long term. Next, let\u2019s turn to Greater China, another geography in which the NIKE brand continues to lead and sustain strong growth. We\u2019ve now delivered 17 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth in Greater China. In Q1, Greater China\u2019s growth was 20% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by Sportswear, Jordan, Basketball and across Women\u2019s and Young Athletes. Growth was also strong in balance across both footwear and apparel. We are winning with the Chinese consumer, first and foremost through the key cities of Shanghai and Beijing. We\u2019re also continually innovating in this large, digitally native marketplace. NIKE Digital growth remained strong and actually accelerated in Q1. We\u2019re also driving growth through our partnerships with China\u2019s leading digital platforms like Tmall and WeChat. And finally, we\u2019re beginning to leverage digital in the largely NIKE branded physical retail environment in China. Say for example, our partner Bai Li [ph], which was acquired last year by Hillhouse, [ph] a leading firm in technology and consumer services. Bai Li [ph] has already rolled out connected inventory that enables a more direct Nike consumer experience with a faster and easier way to fulfill consumer demand, fully leveraging their roughly 2,500 touch points. Now, let\u2019s turn from China to another fast-growing and fast-developing geography, APLA. In Q1, APLA revenue grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by balanced double-digit growth across footwear and apparel and led by Japan, Mexico, and Korea. Two areas of increasing focus for us in APLA have been our women\u2019s business and digital. Women\u2019s growth continues to accelerate, driven by distinctive brand marketing campaigns such as the Come Out in Force, and Rally Cry campaigns focused on inspiring and empowering women through sport. NIKE Digital is also accelerating in APLA with revenue growing over 70% in Q1, the highest rate of growth across all of our geographies as we continue expanding our digital ecosystem across this region. We will continue to sustain strong growth as we roll out the NIKE SNKRS app in markets such as Mexico and Brazil, and bring the NIKE Live retail concept to Tokyo later this fiscal year. Beyond NIKE Direct, we\u2019re also expanding our digital connectivity to consumers across this region through entrepreneurial commerce partnerships such as those with Flipkart, ZOZOTOWN and several others. We see continued momentum in APLA over the course of fiscal year \u201819 and we will continue to invest in this fast-growing diverse geography as we move even closer to the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. And finally, at Converse, revenue increased 7% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was fueled by double-digit revenue growth in Greater China and strong double-digit growth digitally. That said, Converse also experienced declines in undifferentiated wholesale, primarily in the U.S. and the UK. As we move through fiscal year \u201819, we will be expanding Converse\u2019s product portfolio while also elevating the Converse branded digital ecosystem. We are off to an even stronger start to the fiscal year than we initially expected. Our currency-neutral growth and profitability is exceeding our expectations. At the same time, global trade uncertainty and geopolitical dynamics have resulted in the dollar strengthening and foreign exchange shifting to a slight headwind over the past 90 days. Taking into account all of these dynamics, we are maintaining our full year guidance for fiscal year \u201819. Specifically, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits, albeit at the lower end of that range as operational upside will likely be somewhat offset by FX headwinds. We expect gross margin to expand 50 basis points or slightly greater, SG&A to grow in the high single digits and our effective tax rate to be in the mid teens. Other expense net of interest expense is now projected to be an expense of $100 million to $125 million. Based on the FX volatility of late, let me briefly explain more specifically how FX impacts NIKE\u2019s financials in the short term. First, it\u2019s important to note that the revenue line item in our P&L is essentially unhedged. Therefore, our reported real dollar revenue growth reflects nearly all currency movements real time. We do have a robust hedging program that delays the impact of FX on our profitability for 12 to as much as 24 months, most notably with respect to developed market currencies, for example, the euro. However, it is not economical to hedge FX risk in many emerging markets such as Turkey, Argentina, and Brazil. And as for China, we\u2019re able to partially, but not fully hedge our net exposure. Our focus is on sustaining strong, currency-neutral operating momentum over the full year and even more importantly, over the longer term. But, I\u2019ll provide a bit of context on Q2. For Q2, we expect strong currency-neutral revenue growth in line with the 9% currency-neutral revenue growth we delivered in Q1. That said, taking into account real time FX dynamics, reported real dollar revenue growth for Q2 is likely to be 2 to 3 points lower than our currency-neutral revenue growth. For gross margin, we expect Q2 expansion approaching the same level of expansion that we delivered in Q1. As a reminder, we expect less gross margin expansion in the first half of the year, as compared to the second half of the year. In Q2, we expect SG&A growth in the low-teens driven by the timing of our investments in sports marketing, including the kick-off of the NBA and NFL seasons, and the timing of strategic investments in new digital capabilities. For other expense, net of interest expense, we expect expense in Q2 to be in the $30 million to $40 million range. Our execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is creating brand distinction with consumers around the world and driving strong financial performance. At the same time, we see ourselves as being in the early stages of this transformation. There is no finish line for NIKE, particularly as it relates to digital. So, we will continue to invest in the capabilities that will differentiate and create competitive advantage for NIKE long-term. Those capabilities include product innovation, brand marketing, digital, and speed within our supply chain. We are thrilled with our momentum out of the gate in fiscal year \u201819. And nonetheless, we remain on the offense, identifying and attacking opportunities to elevate our game, build on our momentum with consumers, and ensure that we deliver sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth over the long term. With that, we\u2019ll now open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Kate McShane with Citi. Your line is open. Kate McShane : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Looking at the 6% North America growth you saw this quarter, I wondered if you could help us understand how much is being driven by ASP growth versus unit growth, and how much of a drag is the undifferentiated retail. Andy Campion : Hi, Kate. It\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take that one. In North America, we\u2019re actually seeing expansion in average selling prices as well as units. Our growth is relatively well-balanced, as you saw in our reporting across footwear and apparel. So, it\u2019s very strong and balanced growth. And we see that strong and balanced growth continuing over the balance of the year. Kate McShane : Okay. Andy Campion : And for undifferentiated retail, as I mentioned, we\u2019re seeing growth across all dimensions of the marketplace. We have had relatively strong growth with our strategic wholesale partners being Foot Locker, Finish Line, Dick\u2019s and others. That\u2019s being driven by the elevation of the consumer experience with those partners and also by the extraordinary impact of the new innovation and newness that we\u2019re bringing to our product portfolio. We\u2019re in the early stages of some of the more truly transformational change. But, what we\u2019re really encouraged by is that the learnings that we\u2019re having, particularly with the Nike app at retail and Nike by Melrose, in other words, the Nike Live concept. Those conversations are really picking up steam in terms of new concept development that we see a great opportunity for across that bricks and mortar fleet in wholesale. Mark Parker : Yes. I\u2019ll add that the demand that we\u2019re seeing in North America is actually quite balanced across the portfolio. And on top of that the inventory situation is actually quite clean as that demand has been increasing. So, we\u2019re in a good position here. Operator : Next question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Your line is open. Bob Drbul : I guess, the question that I have is more of a bigger picture question for you. I was wondering if you could address your demand creation advertising marketing approach. There has been a little bit of news the last couple of weeks and some controversy around it. And I was just wondering if you could maybe address how you approach these types of situations, the concerns that you have but the benefits that you see around certain campaigns? Mark Parker : Yes. Well, just generally, we\u2019re motivated to inspire our consumer to connect and engage and inspire. We feel actually very good and very proud of the work that we\u2019re doing with Just Do It, introducing Just Do It to the new generation of consumers, on the 30th anniversary of the campaign when it first debuted. We know it\u2019s resonated actually quite strongly with consumers. Obviously, here, in North America but also around the world, it\u2019s really transcended to North America market to touch people around the world. We have an incredible line up of athletes in that spot. When you look at the Just Do It campaign and the list of athletes we have there, it\u2019s actually quite impressive including Serena and Odell, Colin, Shaquem Griffin, Lacey Baker, these are actually very inspiring athletes. And again, we feel like that campaign has delivered on that that message in a way that\u2019s really connected with people around the world. Like any campaign, it\u2019s -- not any campaign but many campaigns, it\u2019s driving a real uptake, I think in traffic and engagement, both socially as well as commercially. We\u2019ve seen record engagement with the brand as part of the campaign. And our brand strength, as you well know, is key dimension that contributes to the ongoing momentum that we\u2019re building across the NIKE portfolio. And that\u2019s really how we look at it. It is how do we connect and engage in a way that\u2019s relevant and inspiring to the consumers that we are here to serve. Bob Drbul : Great. Thanks. And I guess, the second good question I have is, after this weekend\u2019s golf results, I was wondering if you had any perspective on how Phil Mickelson feels ahead of the match-play event in November with Tiger? Mark Parker : Yes. He\u2019s probably feeling more pressure, I would imagine. It\u2019s great to see Tiger back and the reaction to his performance on Sunday was pretty inspiring. So, yes, I think Phil might be feeling little bit of that pressure. Operator : Next question comes from Lauren Cassel with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Lauren Cassel : First, is there any color you can share on North America DTC growth specifically during the quarter? And then, just bigger picture, there\u2019s been some caution or nervousness in the market about potential slow down in the Chinese economy and consumer spending there. Obviously, you guys delivered some really nice growth there this quarter. But, are there any fines or signals that you\u2019re seeing that would suggest a slowdown there? Thanks so much. Andy Campion : Sure. I will take North America NIKE Direct or DTC, as you put it, growth. I\u2019ll hit it on all three dimensions. We had extremely strong double-digit growth in digital and acceleration in that regard. We have taken a number of actions to remove friction, enhance the consumer experience, allocates product to that channel where we know consumers\u2019 demand is robust. And we\u2019re actually using data and demand sensing to better lineup supply with demand digitally. So, incredibly strong growth digitally. In our in-line stores, we\u2019re actually seeing strong comps as well. We\u2019ve seen traffic up and even more notably conversion. And conversion in the in-line stores we\u2019re seeing as a direct result of two things. One, the brand distinction that Mark mentioned in response to the last question as well as the product that we\u2019re bringing to market; we\u2019re seeing incredibly strong full price sell-through on our line right now, our closeout mix is down in inventory and are off price sales are down as a percent of total. In our factory stores, our factory stores continue to be a very profitable dimension of the business. And frankly, the only challenge I would really highlight in our factory stores is that its full price sell-through is so strong and in-line and digitally, it leaves some gaps in terms of the assortment that we bring to market in the short-term in our factory stores. But, we\u2019ve identified opportunities in that regard and are looking at supply to fill those gaps. So, again, it\u2019s a nice  So again, it\u2019s a nice problem to have. Mark Parker : Yes. Let me touch on China. Yes. I mean, as Andy has mentioned in his remarks, we\u2019ve seen 17 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth and really strong underlying fundamentals within the market, things -- factors like the growth of the middle class, sports participation, obviously a very digitally savvy consumer, and we\u2019re well-positioned in that regard in the marketplace. In terms of the NIKE brand and its position, we have a very strong connection with the Chinese consumer. We have for a long time, we\u2019re leading the market in digital, growing 40% in Q1. We\u2019ve had great relationships with our digital partners there; I mentioned Tmall, WeChat is starting up with the tremendous potential there. So, there\u2019s great momentum in the marketplace and across multiple categories, sportswear, running, basketball. The Jordan Brand is incredibly strong in China. So our fundamentals in China are actually quite silent and strong. We\u2019re not seeing any pushback from consumers. On the contrary, our relationship with actually consumers is strong as they can possibly be. We feel confident in our ability to continue to grow, and that\u2019s reflected in our outlook for China over this next year. And we feel like there\u2019s great momentum and that we\u2019re in a good position for that to continue. Now, that said, we\u2019re mindful of the dynamics. But, we are focused on serving that Chinese consumer, strengthening our position there. And I\u2019ll just I guess close by saying, we are the most popular brand with the Chinese consumer. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your lines open. Jim Duffy : Good balance in the quarter, a lot of good indicators. The inventory looks well-managed and you\u2019re seeing strong results in DTC and also spoke about improving margin from DTC. I\u2019m wondering, can you speak about some of the elements of cost inflation that are offsetting the mix benefits in the gross margin. And Andy, can you detail the FX impact considered in the gross margin outlook for the year? Andy Campion : Sure. I\u2019ll hit both dynamics, cost and FX. But, let me first give you a little bit of overall context on our margins. We\u2019re seeing strong structural improvement in our margins, and that\u2019s being driven by the innovation we\u2019re bringing to market and in turn the strong full price versus off price mix. Second, it\u2019s being driven by the over indexing growth in our NIKE Digital business. And it\u2019s also being amplified by the initiatives that we have around product cost management. In the first half of the year, there is one element of material so to speak that it\u2019s a bit of a headwind, and that\u2019s in the chemical space, namely rubber. That will ease in the second half of the year. As we look at FX as well, FX is much more of a tailwind in the margin line item of our P&L in the second half of the year, as compared to the first half of the year. So, if I refer back to the guidance that we gave as we entered the year and we reiterated today, we have strong gross margin expansion forecast for the entire fiscal year. At the same time, we see slightly less margin expansion in the first half and more margin expansion in the second half. Jim Duffy : Very good. And then Mark for you. Last nine months, particularly strong period for new product introductions and bringing new innovation to the marketplace. Can you talk about how to think about the cadence from here? Will there be a gap or is there a predictable launch cycle you expect to work with as we look out over the next couple of years? Mark Parker : Yes. Our 2X Innovation initiative is really all about a steady flow of innovation. I feel very positive, very confident with what\u2019s in the innovation pipeline and what\u2019s coming. I mentioned a couple of things earlier. The new iterations of our Air cushioning platform with the 720, a very exciting product that\u2019s building on the VaporMax and 270. So, that\u2019s exciting. I also mentioned the adaptable -- adaptive footwear technology coming into performance sport, and you\u2019ll see that on professional athletes very soon. We have an incredible lineup coming I think throughout the fiscal year of product. We\u2019re actually focusing on bringing innovation into the core price points as well. So, we have a balanced portfolio of innovation across both footwear and apparel. And then we have opportunity to further dimensionalize the incredible platforms that we\u2019ve got. I mean, I mentioned Air, React, ZoomX. There\u2019s still a tremendous amount of potential to leverage those, both in performance across categories and then also across sportswear. And then, I have to tell you, I can\u2019t really shed too much light on this at this stage, but my excitement around what\u2019s coming as we, believe it or not, ramp up our portfolio around the Tokyo Olympics. NIKE is -- that\u2019s always a time where we showcase our innovation and the build up to the Olympics is an incredibly exciting time for NIKE, and the innovation that we deliver. So, I guarantee you, we won\u2019t disappoint with some of the things we have coming up. And you\u2019ll start to see some of that ramp up over the next 12 to 18 months. Operator : Your next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Paul Trussell : Good afternoon. Solid results. Just on North America, given the acceleration that we saw throughout the first quarter, is it fair to assume that the exit rate was more in the high single-digit range? And while I know overall global revenue outlook has not changed, has your thought process on what is achievable in North America maybe been upped a little bit? Andy Campion : Sure. Thanks for the complements, Paul. And I\u2019ll take that one. Our goals for North America are long-term focused. It\u2019s a large important geography. And as you may recall, at our Investor Day in October, we said we were targeting mid single digit revenue growth over the next five years, as we innovate within the marketplace from a digital perspective and transform the broader retail landscape. On that note, we said there might be some disruption in the short-term as well. So, to some extent, we hedged a little bit with respect to fiscal year \u201819. To be clear, we\u2019ve returned to strong growth in North America, even faster than we had expected. We have demand that is outstripping supply. You saw our inventory in North America was flat. And so, what we\u2019re focused on and we\u2019re always focused on, you can rest assured is capitalizing on every opportunity that we see to serve demand in the North America marketplace. We\u2019re not providing specific guidance from a geo perspective. But, I will tell you that the brand is incredibly strong, our product\u2019s resonating, sell-through is strong. And even beyond what\u2019s working and what you can see in our numbers, we see opportunity to go beyond that and potentially even more importantly drive that sustainable growth over that five-year horizon. And those opportunities fall under the overall umbrella of what Mark often refers to as our complete offense. So, at any given time, even when we have extraordinary momentum, there are areas underneath that umbrella where we see greater opportunity than we\u2019re capitalizing on. Specifically in North America, I touched on Jordan. We see acceleration in Jordan over the coming months and certainly out of this fiscal year and into next year. Women\u2019s is growing strong. Women\u2019s was very strong dimension of growth for us as a company. But we see even more opportunity, it\u2019s not so much about the rate of growth, it\u2019s how much more opportunity is out there in the women\u2019s business, especially around athletic footwear and apparel. And then, finally, another dimension, a huge opportunity in North America is our Young Athletes business. It may surprise some people to know that it\u2019s one of our largest categories. At the same time, we see the opportunity to bring new materials, colors, prints, and even designs directly targeted at young athletes. We have a silhouette called the Future Series, which is actually an innovation that\u2019s made specifically for kids. So, we do see a tremendous amount of opportunity in North America. Suffice it to say, we\u2019re really pleased with the momentum we have and we\u2019re bullish on being able to sustain growth in North America in fiscal year \u201819 and beyond. And then, you also asked about global growth. You made a comment that said it\u2019s pretty consistent. I just want to be clear, on a currency-neutral basis, our momentum on the top line from a revenue perspective is stronger globally than we expected when we came into the year. While we maintained our high single digit reported revenue growth guidance that takes into account that over the last 90 days since we last spoke to you, FX has been pretty volatile. And as I touched on that line item in our P&L is essentially unhedged. So, while we protect the profitability through hedging, we see those impacts real time and that\u2019s also why I gave you a little bit more color on Q2 guidance. Operator : Your last question comes from Jamie Merriman with Bernstein. Your line is open. Jamie Merriman : Thanks very much. Andy, you touched on how you\u2019re using data, a little bit earlier, but I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about, is it inventory allocation by channel, by geography, is some of that data starting to help drive your product creation efforts and are there other ways that it\u2019s being deployed at this point? And then, just as follow-up, you talked about the Jet.com partnership. Can you just talked about how that compares to the Amazon partnership? Thank you. Andy Campion : Sure. I\u2019ll start with data and analytics. It is truly an end to end initiative at NIKE. It starts with consumer data and analysis around consumer data. And I\u2019d say, that is manifesting itself right now already and most importantly, in terms of digital demand sensing. Us continuing to leverage the intuition that we have, but amplifying that intuition with real data as to what consumers preferences are. And one of the best examples is NIKE by Melrose. That store, that NIKE Live store in Los Angeles, the entire assortment is based on data that we\u2019re analyzing around what consumers in those ZIP codes have purchased and are interested in and some of the key themes.  You move from digital demand sensing to digital product creation. So, taking that insight and designing and creating product leveraging digital technology that allows us to bring that insight to life in a product faster. And then, absolutely, we\u2019re using data in our supply chain to tighten our demand and supply management. And you see that already beginning to impact our full price versus off price sell-through. On the very front end, of course, from a consumer perspective, data and analytics helps us personalize the consumer experience on the NIKE app, as well as the SNKRS app, and even in our physical retail environment, as we use things like the NIKE app at retail. And in that regard, one of the most notable successes or pilots early on has been connected inventory. So, using RFID and using data and analytics, in terms of where inventory is and where consumers are looking to buy to get them the product they want more seamlessly. And then, as for your second question, you asked about Jet.com and how that might compare to some of our other partnerships. And I\u2019ll say that -- Mark will probably want to add something here, we\u2019re excited about this partnership with Jet because it is a partnership that is really about creating a compelling consumer experience around the NIKE brand, leveraging NIKE membership to help better serve consumers in that channel, helping ensure that there\u2019s a clean assortment of product that\u2019s presented to that consumer across the marketplace. So, there are several aspects of it that we view as distinctive in terms of the offering that we\u2019ll make to consumers. At the same time, it\u2019s one of several initiatives across a range of digital commerce platforms. Mark Parker : Yes. I\u2019ll just add on Jet. We\u2019re starting off with a more focused pilot as we look at offering a select amount of product in key cities across North America. It\u2019s an assortment that\u2019s tailored to those consumers, what we would call a brand friendly shopping experience. We\u2019re looking at our digital partners to help co-create elevated consumer experiences and how they partner with NIKE. And so, we can work together on advancing our connection to consumers through digital commerce. We are looking at how we partner with these digital platforms to advance the consumer connection in terms of product selection, in terms personal service, in terms of how the brand is presented online. And we\u2019re optimistic and feel very strong that the relationship with Jet.com is going to offer us those opportunities. So, we\u2019re excited about that. Amazon, our business with Amazon is performing well, not a huge update here, other than we\u2019ve seen really good sell-through on a limited selection of products that we\u2019ve offered. We\u2019ve said before that we want to work together to elevate the consumer experience, and that\u2019s important in any digital partnership that we enter into. We get the most out of our relationship when we work together to elevate that brand presentation. And one of the things we\u2019re going to continue to focus on is how we share data with our digital partners to advance that consumer experience. But we feel like the partnership with the Amazon is working or moving toward a mutually beneficial space. So, we\u2019re actually feeling good about where we are. And it\u2019s important that we stay focused and continue to look for those opportunities together. Nitesh Sharan : Excellent. Thank you. Thank you, Jamie. All right. Well, that\u2019s the allotted time we have for today. Thank you everyone for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Take care.

[Operator Instructions] Thanks for your cooperation on this. I'll now turn the call over to NIKE Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker. Mark Parker : Thanks, Nitesh. Hello and happy holidays, everyone. We've seen some amazing highlights in sports this past year. Eliud Kipchoge smashed the Marathon World Record. Simone Byles dominated the world championships. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 became a global star at the World Cup and LeBron James continued to inspire on and off the court. It was a year of incredible achievements for NIKE as well and Q2 was another strong proof point on our journey. We continue to show progress against our key long-term objectives of driving innovation, direct connections and speed and agility around the world. Our teams are doing a fantastic job of delivering sustainable, profitable growth through the Consumer Direct Offense, while aggressively pursuing our highest potential long-term opportunities. We set high goals and each success makes us hungry for more. The marketplace in which we compete is highly dynamic. Consumer expectations are accelerating and the macro-economy is increasingly volatile. A key part of our strategy to win in this environment is to double down on digital. Our digital transformation is taking hold through a series of positive disruptions across the business. For example, we're leading the industry through a retail revolution. We're creating sports first, smart adaptive footwear. And we're investing in a global supply chain that delivers personnel at scale. It's all incredibly energizing and we find that the more disruptive we are, the more we grow. Our digital disruption is fueled by breaking old models, building new commerce partnerships, emerging new talent with our years of industry experience. Our teams are driving change and it's yielding excellent results. For the quarter, NIKE Inc. revenues grew 10%. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Inc. revenue increased 14%. Gross margin was up 80 basis points to prior year and earnings per share was up 13% to prior year. Specific highlights include 9% growth in North America and nearly 20% constant currency growth in our international geographies. Digital growth of 41% on a constant currency basis and continued momentum in both sportswear and performance categories, including a return to growth in the Jordan business. The momentum we're driving is grounded in strong product innovation. We're increasing the pace of new concepts and bringing a new discipline to how we manage the life cycle of our innovation. We have a clear road map of how we stage our new platforms, giving each one the space to shine through high-energy storytelling and then ramping up scale and choice to serve diverse consumer needs. Put simply, we're increasing the return on investment in innovation. One of our great differentiators is, of course, NIKE Air. It's being energized through platforms like VaporMax and Air Max 270, two of the world's top-selling athletic footwear models. New interpretations of our icons, led by the Air Max 95 and 97. And this spring, we're excited to add a new distinct Air platform to the mix with the Air Max 270. The consumer is already anticipating its arrival and will keep the interest high through multiple iterations early in its product life cycle. NIKE React too will enter a new phase as we expand the platform beyond running and basketball into lifestyle product, with the Element 55, and the shoe of the year, the Element 87. Both styles will scale significantly in 2019. Next year, we'll also add NIKE React hybrids to combine multiple cushioning platforms, along with a redesigned Epic React 2.0 coming in spring. As we broaden platforms across categories, we're also broadening them across price points to bring them to more people. As we mentioned on our call - last call, we see greater opportunities for moderately priced footwear from NIKE right now. So we're creating a more complete consumer offense for core footwear by creating performance and lifestyle icons and core-only innovations. At NIKE, it's our mission to make athletes better. But perhaps no innovation delivers on that promise by ZoomX and the Vaporfly 4%, which has dominated the world's marathons since 2017. We've started something special with the 4%, enabling a dramatic improvement for the world's best runners, and you can expect more exciting breakthroughs to come here. That reputation has made its way to every day athletes, making 4%, the most sought after shoe on race day, and it's created a halo effect for many of our NIKE's fast footwear styles, especially the Peg 35, driving double-digit growth in the running category in Q2. I'm excited to announce that in the New Year, we'll launch a new adaptive performance platform in Basketball at the $350 price point. We have a smart shoe designed for the perfect fit and it's a major step in advancing and connecting our digital transformation to product. This is just one better fit solution amongst many that we're working on. And we look forward to rolling them out throughout the year. We have a full innovation pipeline ahead, including new cushioning platforms, which will carry our strong product momentum into fiscal '20, all the way to Tokyo Olympics and beyond. I've spent a lot of time with the Olympics team and the Tokyo 2020 collection is the boldest we've ever assembled across performance and lifestyle in footwear and apparel. We're growing our competitive advantages in many ways. Sustainability is one example, where we're reducing waste at a scale that creates change for our entire industry. NIKE Flyleather made a 50% reclaimed leather, will scale to over 1 million pairs starting this summer. NIKE Flyknit represents a multi-billion dollar business and uses 60% less waste than traditional manufacturing. And NIKE Air uses 50% recycled manufacturing waste in hundreds of millions of pairs. As a whole, we're making great progress to lower our environmental impact as a company, driving greater efficiencies and fueling growth in our business. Another area where our 2X Innovation agenda is making a dramatic impact is in apparel. As designers, there is no greater challenge than innovating for the body in motion. We think about many things, such as how to account for different environments through moisture management, creating breathability that adapts as needed or keeping our gourmet comfortable, the climate comfortable when it's twisting and turning. Through new materials and methods of make, our apparel teams are continuing to push the limits in performance silhouettes, and in the process, creating new style. Our strategy starts with taking sports into new places. For example, in basketball, our partnership with the NBA is fueling strong growth. Our NBA apparel accelerated in year two, especially with our city editions jerseys, led by Miami, Minnesota and Brooklyn. And to no one 's surprise, LeBron has moved to the Lake, who has also created opportunity. We already booked 3x more NIKE lakers gear this year. And our work with the NBA has also created a lift for NIKE in line basketball apparel. We built on the success of our showtime hoodie and added Therma Flex pants, which has seen great sell-through. Overall, the traction we've gained for basketball in NIKE Direct and internationally led to strong global growth for the Basketball category this quarter. In sportswear, our biggest category apparel grew over 20% this quarter. Sportswear fleece and women's apparel were up double digits. In sportswear, we are anchoring our communications around head-to-toe collections, which makes it easier for consumers to shop to complete look and strengthens our presentation and storytelling. Apparel continues to be one of NIKE's greatest growth opportunities, and in the back half of the fiscal year, there's a lot to be excited about. We're launching new high-performance kits for the Woman's World Cup in France. Yoga collection, that includes men's yoga apparel for the first time at NIKE. New types innovation and expanded NIKE Tech Pack collection. Two other areas of our business where we're accelerating, but we know we have much more opportunity ahead is Women's and Jordan. There's incredible momentum for women in sport right now as athletes elite and every day lead a movement of health and wellness, while driving a strong appetite for athletic footwear and apparel. This energy is manifesting in a number of ways. For example, footwear for women overall was up 20% for the quarter, and sneakers for her are really taking off with the Sage Air Force 1 emerging as for favorite franchise, owning the number one spot on nike.com for 5 weeks running. Our edit to amplify strategy to offer more color and material choices and fewer styles is also proving successful. NIKE has the top three selling women's athletic footwear models above $125 with the Air Max 270, VaporMax and Epic React. And in apparel, our broad business remains a strong growth opportunity, up over 20% in Q2. Looking ahead to this summer's World Cup, NIKE will dominate on the pitch. A total of 14 of the 24 national teams will compete in NIKE, including the favorite U.S. national team. And throughout the year, we'll continue to - our Just Do It campaign that celebrates elite and everyday female athletes around the world. We think 2019 is going to be a true tipping point for woman in sport with more participation, more coverage and overall more energy. Meanwhile, with the Jordan Brand, we're seeing positive results from the strategic shifts that we are making. In Q2, Jordan grew double digits and we returned to healthy, sustainable growth in North America. At the same time, we continued our pace of double-digit growth internationally. We're making great progress in diversifying Jordan. Apparel had a very strong quarter, especially internationally. Sell-through of the Jordan and PSG collaboration exceeded expectations and we'll come back with a refreshed collection in January. Jordan's performance footwear is also contributing to solid growth, led by the new Air Jordan XXXIII [ph] game shoe and the Max Aura that's doing well in China at $120 price point. And from a Sportswear perspective, we're elevating our storytelling with icons like the Air Jordan 1, which is more coveted than ever. At the start of Q3, our team executed an incredible effort with the most successful NIKE sneaker ever launched, with the Air Jordan XI Concord. It was a well-orchestrated plan, complete with geo targeting that offered preheat paris [ph] to our members, total integration across our business with partners like House of Hoops and Footaction and locally driven storytelling in our key cities. The Concord shows that the Jordan Brand yet again has the power to drive launches with incredible volume and create energy for the brand. We're bringing much greater balance to Jordan with much more opportunity ahead. In 2X Direct, we're beginning to realize a multiplying effect as we scale our most innovative experiences. This quarter, you could feel the momentum swing in the conversation around retail. We saw at over the Thanksgiving shopping week, fueling more than 30% increase in our digital business in North America for the quarter. In China, Singles Day once again broke records. NIKE earned a number one sport brand on Tmall with our overall business for the day, up over 40% from last year's Singles Day. It's clear that the consumers craving experiences and the fastest way to meet that demand is to test, learn and scale new features. We know not every one of our new experiences will be successful and not all will be scalable. But when we do find features that improve our services, NIKE's advantage is how quickly we deploy them across our global footprint. In November, we opened our House of Innovation concept in both Shanghai and New York. The energy and performance at both locations has exceeded expectations. Both stores create the most personal and responsive retail environment in the industry. It's a digital experience brought to life in a physical space. And uses our most exciting features to date, such as the ability to scan barcodes to check availability and by the full look of mannequins, instant check out that requires no waiting at the register, expert studio that gives personal guidance, and special unlocks and notifications when members enter the store. The gateway for consumers to get the most value out of these new experiences is membership. We want more doors to feel like a personal home for members, where we can elevate one-to-one service. And we want to leverage mobile apps to make sure NIKE is serving our consumers wherever they are  One way we do that with members is to create ways to be in their path more organically. For example, the LeBron Watch, which will deliver 25% of the LeBron 16s in the marketplace this year makes these on court shoes available in the moment through sneakers and our partner mobile apps. In China, this month, we gave early access to the Kyrie 5 through a QR code and a live streamed NBA game on WeChat. And users can now buy directly on our NIKE Run Club and NIKE Training Club apps, personalized to the way they train. Another key to making NIKE commerce a part of people's lives more seamlessly again and again is to develop unique experiences with some of the world's most engaging and brand-friendly platforms. And this quarter, we did that with a new feature in Instagram, that allows NIKE product to be shopped directly from stores. On the Apple Watch, where we continue to serve our most active and highly-valued NIKE Run Club members. And with Google, where consumers can now buy directly from NIKE through search and Google Assistant. And to further leverage partnerships that amplify our brand, we're making great strides with strategic partners like JD Sports, Foot Locker, Nordstrom and Dick's Sporting Goods, where elevated experiences are driving outsized growth in the wholesale channel. We know that to fully leverage or fully offer consumers what they want in the moment requires a high level of agility in our business. And through 2X Speed, we're elevating the industry, creating an end-to-end value chain that's centered on the consumer. The pillars are demand sensing and insights, so we know our consumer, responsive product creation and manufacturing to provide the best product, delivery at speed for product to arrive when they wanted and connected inventory so they're never disappointed and starts with better demand sensing and insights. In Q2, our Express Lane business grew double digits, supporting key cities with hyperlocal product and faster fulfillment to drive higher full price sell-through. Responsive product creation and manufacturing has many components. Digital product creation allows for greater precision and creativity and design, planning and staging materials drastically reduces lead times and automation increases speed and quality in manufacturing. Today, more than half of our total footwear production has been modernized through initiatives started in the modernization centers of our top six manufacturing partners and our Advanced Product Creation Center at our world headquarters. We're also investing in delivery at speed. Take Singles Day as an example. To deliver against this massive opportunity, we had coordinated fulfillment strategy across our 12 Greater China distribution centers, and we shipped direct from over 50 retail doors to consumers on the day. Overall, we fulfilled over 5 million units in 5 days. And finally, our connected inventory strategy with partners like Zalando and JD will help us realize many of our Speed initiatives. In support of that initiative, we'll introduce RFID into footwear and all not licensed apparel in 2019. This will lead to vastly improve product visibility and accuracy across the supply chain from product creation to point-of-sale. And it further opens up the possibility to integrate more widely with our wholesale partners, contract factories and distribution centers. Each of these work streams is a building block for NIKE to become more personal at scale. And as a system, they demand enterprise-wide coordination and innovation. NIKE's ambitious digital transformation is driving the strong results you see today. We're staying competitive and opportunistic with every shift in the marketplace. As a leader, NIKE has high expectations. And as good as this quarter was, we know we have the ability to do much more. We're going to continue to use our scale, speed and agility to grow sport and our business around the world. Thanks. And now here's Andy Andrew Campion : Thank you, Mark, and happy holidays, everyone. Our Q2 financial performance was exceptionally strong across nearly all dimensions. 14% currency neutral revenue growth, 80 basis points of gross margin expansion, 13% EPS growth versus prior year. Our strong growth was also broad-based across all four of our geographies, as well as across footwear, apparel, men's, women's and most categories. This broad-based momentum is not happening by accident, but rather is being fueled by our focus on what matters most to consumers globally. The common theme across our portfolio is the Consumer Direct Offense. More specifically, we are bringing the triple-double of 2X Innovation, 2X Direct and 2X Speed to life in our 12 key cities and 10 key countries around the world. Take innovation, for example. We've said we expect new innovation platforms to drive over 50% of our incremental growth over the next 5 years. In fact, year-to-date, new innovation platforms, including VaporMax, Air Max 270, React and ZoomX have driven over 80% of our incremental growth. Another significant contributor to our growth from a product perspective are our Power Franchises. By leveraging an approach that Mark calls editing to amplify, we're bringing new dimension and driving the growth of iconic franchises like the Air Force 1 and the Air Jordan 1. We do that, for example, through fresh new designs and collaborations for both men and women, as well as color and material updates through our Express Lane. Our broad-based growth is also being fueled by new experiences that more directly connect NIKE to our consumers globally. We expect NIKE Direct and partnered NIKE experiences physical and digital will contribute over 50% of our incremental growth and outpace undifferentiated retail over the next 5 years, leading the way once again in Q2 with NIKE Digital. Our NIKE Digital ecosystem continues to grow faster than all other channels, growing 41% on a currency neutral basis. And as we drive deeper, more organic, one-to-one engagement with consumers, mobile now represents well over 50% of our digital commerce revenue. Our 2X Speed initiative is also driving our momentum. Cutting our time to market in half is not an all or nothing proposition, we're already infusing greater speed and agility into our product creation and supply chain processes, allowing us to amplify what's working with the consumer closer to real time. For example, product updated and fulfilled through our Express Lane is growing double digits and now represents a double-digit percentage of our total business. This is significant as Express Lane product also largely sells through at full price, favorably impacting margins. 2X Speed also includes initiatives ranging from leveraging automation to a more focused materials power and material staging. These initiatives also reduce product cost and enhance inventory efficiency, the greater labor productivity and less waste. In short, we are very pleased with our strategic execution and the strong performance we have delivered to date. That said, more importantly, we are confident in the sustainability of our growth going forward. While FX headwinds have intensified, we now expect stronger currency neutral revenue growth in fiscal year '19 than previously planned. And as we're beginning to gain greater insight into fiscal year '20, we're seeing continued strong demand. Our positive outlook is not merely optimism, but rather is founded on fundamental changes in how we operate at NIKE. One fundamental change is how we bring innovation to market. In addition to driving faster innovation cycles, we're also focused on innovation platforms that have greater potential to scale across geographies. Accordingly, as Mark detailed, we've an extraordinary pipeline of innovation to come over the balance of fiscal year '19 and throughout fiscal year '20. That begins in spring with the launch of the Air Max 720 and HyperAdapt in Basketball, and extends the innovation platforms launching in early fiscal year '20 and through and beyond the Tokyo Olympics. We're also digitally transforming NIKE and driving positive disruption in our industry, unlocking new opportunities for growth long-term. While we already have extraordinary digital momentum, we're still in the early stages of this transformation. We are executing against a 3 year road map of new digital capabilities that will enable us to continually serve consumers better. We're aggressively building those capabilities in-house and accelerating our development of those capabilities through acquisition. Our 3 year road map also includes the global expansion of our digital ecosystem in the key cities and countries, where we see the greatest opportunity for growth. For example, just last month, we launched the NIKE App in Japan, where it immediately became the number one rated shopping app. Over the next 5 years, we see the Consumer Direct Offense delivering on the financial model and measures of success we communicated at our Investor Day back in October 2017. But we are already setting our sights even higher longer term. We see the opportunity to expand the definition of sport, to be even more inclusive, including competition and training as well as movement and play. By using this broader lens to inspire and enable more active lifestyle, we will grow the market for athletic footwear and apparel. There are four areas where this purpose-driven approach to growth is creating outsized opportunities for us, international, digital, apparel and women's. The overall footwear and apparel industries in our international markets are already significantly larger in aggregate than in the U.S. That said, in international markets, the athletic segment of the overall footwear and apparel market has historically been less penetrated than in the U.S., but that is changing fast. Sport participation and culture continue to accelerate in international markets. And when sport grows, NIKE grows. China is perhaps the best current example of this phenomenon. And second, we said at our Investor Day, that digital owned and partnered, would comprise 30% of our business by 2023 as compared to roughly 15% of our business today. Frankly, we're already thinking bigger as we look longer term. Our industry has lagged many other industries in terms of digital penetration. Many consumer products industries are already at 50% digital penetration and projected to be well over 80% digital by 2030. We all know that disruptive new consumer-centric digital experiences have catalyzed the shift to digital in those industries. So as we increasingly innovate and lead with digital, we are intentionally disrupting our industry. We see this as positive disruption that widens the aperture for growth long term. We now see 30% digital penetration as just a milepost on our path to the majority of our business being digital. Third, apparel is another extraordinary opportunity for growth at NIKE. Apparel is a larger market in footwear globally. And at the same time, athletic apparel accounts for a smaller percentage of overall apparel than athletic accounts for within overall footwear. That dynamic is also changing fast. Consumers are increasingly choosing performance and sportswear apparel for more occasions as it better serves their more active and expressive lifestyle. And finally, as we aim to redefine and expand the definition of sport, that is with a sharp focus on women. Similar to the strong returns we are seeing from having doubled our investment in innovation, we see the potential for asymmetrical returns by editing and more aggressively shifting resources towards our women's business. The women's footwear and apparel markets are larger than men's. Yet today, women's represents less than quarter of NIKE's total revenue. And we're already on this journey, as our women's business grew double digits in Q2, but we see step change growth opportunities ahead by serving women more deeply within classifications and across more occasions for her. In short, we have strong current momentum and we have extraordinary growth potential long term. But before I share more specifics regarding our outlook, let's reflect on the drivers of our current momentum. NIKE Inc. Q2 revenue increased 10%, up 14% on a currency neutral basis. This exceptional growth reflects double-digit currency neutral momentum internationally and strong high single-digit growth in North America. NIKE Digital was the fastest growing channel in each geography with 41% growth in aggregate on a currency neutral basis, again, led by mobile. That said, FX headwinds had a slightly larger impact on our reported revenue growth than the roughly three points we anticipated 90 days ago. We also delivered strong gross margin expansion of 80 basis points across NIKE Inc., fueled by NIKE Direct's growth and a higher mix of full price sales. Demand creation grew 4% in the quarter with our focus being on increasingly connecting with consumers through digital experiences and platforms. Operating overhead increased 18%, reflecting strategic investments that are accelerating NIKE's digital transformation and will fuel long-term growth. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 15%. Second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.52, up 13% versus prior year. And as of November 30, inventories were up just 1%, reflecting a healthy pull market for NIKE and a lower mix of closeout across all geographies. Now let's turn to the financial performance for our reported operating segments. In North America, Q2 revenue grew 9% on a reported and currency neutral basis. NIKE Direct grew high single digits with NIKE Digital up well over 30% in North America. As Mark mentioned, we are now turning our vision for the next generation of retail into a reality. In our NIKE Live concept on Melrose, we're aligning data-driven, bi-weekly flow of the product to the store with digital storytelling and one-to-one connections between the store team and local consumers. As a result, the store is driving strong digital member acquisition, engagement and buying. And we're seeing even more impressive early results at our new House of Innovation in New York. While the overall retail marketplace in North America is still going through consolidation, and we do expect that to continue, our NIKE wholesale business in aggregate has returned to strong growth with improving profitability, led by our strategic retail partners, such as Foot Locker and increasingly JD. In Q2, we also reignited brand heat in North America through the Just Do It campaign that was launched in early September and by amplifying key moments in sport like the launch of the NBA season. We see our brand tee across both NIKE and Jordan, our strong pipeline of innovative product and digitally like consumer experiences continuing to fuel strong growth in North America. In EMEA, Q2 revenue grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong growth across sportswear, running, training and Jordan. NIKE Digital led all dimensions of the marketplace growing over 30% versus prior year. We have extraordinary momentum in this geography as we're taking significant share and we're growing the market. We are mindful of the geopolitical dynamics in Europe. That said, we have a long track record of delivering growth and profitability amidst a wide range of macroeconomic circumstances. As we look ahead, we expect our momentum to continue in Europe. In all five of our key cities in EMEA, consumers rate us as the number one cool and number one favorite brand, and in fact, those ratings strengthened even further in Q2. We're connecting more directly and deeply with consumers locally through our key city focus and we're seeing the impact globally. For example, through the PSG-Jordan partnership, we connected authentically with consumers in Paris, while the product sold out at launch around the world. We also recently introduced the NIKE App at Retail and NIKE Town London, as well as the sneaker's past experience in Paris, allowing consumers to reserve shoes from high heat launches and pick up in store. Those services are removing friction and personalizing the shopping experience, driving significant new member acquisition in two of our key global cities. Next, let's turn to Greater China, where yet, again we delivered double-digit revenue growth in Q2. This marks the 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in China. In Q2, growth accelerated to 31% on a currency-neutral basis with digital growing over 40%. As evidence of the scale and digital nature of this important market, as well as the strength of the NIKE Brand, our sneakers app community in China, and recall that the sneakers app was launched just last year, it's already the same size as our sneakers community in North America. In Q2, with the opening of House of Innovation in Shanghai, we also began to more fully leverage digital in this largely NIKE-branded physical retail environment. It's still early days, but the results have been extraordinary. While there has been uncertainty of late regarding U.S., China relations, we have not seen any impact on our business. NIKE continues to win with the consumer in China. For over three decades, NIKE has been a brand of China, for China. We've connected deeply with the consumer here through our key city focus on Shanghai and Beijing. Through partnerships with sports federations, teams and athletes and by partnering with China's Ministry of Sport to fuel greater sport participation in schools across the country. In fact, just last month, leading up to the Shanghai Marathon, we took Eliud Kipchoge on a tour of Shanghai and other key cities. And then on Marathon Day, we launched a Shanghai-focused Just Do It campaign. In just the first 24 hours, the campaign was watched more than 16 million times. We are bullish about our potential to continue delivering strong, sustainable and very profitable growth in this important geography. In APLA, Q2 revenue grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis with balanced double-digit growth across footwear and apparel, as well as double-digit growth in sportswear Jordan and NIKE basketball. NIKE Digital is also accelerating in APLA with revenue growing over 75%. We also continue to expand our digital connectivity to consumers across this region through commerce partnerships, such as ZOZOTOWN, Flipkart and others. APLA is a market in which we are extremely entrepreneurial, testing new concepts that leverage digital to enhance the consumer experience at retail. As we mentioned on our last call, we'll be opening a NIKE Live experience in Tokyo in Q3. And in Seoul, we are testing our connected inventory strategy. We have connected the inventory across 19 NIKE branded doors, including doors owned by two of our strategic partners. This connected inventory pilot has yielded very promising early results, serving thousands of consumers whose demand would otherwise have been unmet due to product being out of stock in a particular store. And finally at Converse, revenue increased 6% on a currency neutral basis in Q2. Growth was driven by strong double-digit growth in Asia and a sharp acceleration in own digital growth globally, approaching triple digits. While Converse wholesale in the U.S. and U.K. remain challenged in Q2, Digital also accelerated in those markets. We see significant opportunity to grow Converse by expanding the product portfolio, including within Basketball as well as launching a new digital platform. And with that, let's turn to our outlook. There is increasing volatility and uncertainty of late on a macro level. That said, what is certain is that NIKE's execution of the consumer direct offense is driving consistently strong and sustainable broad-based growth across our diverse global portfolio. That is because we are focused on what matters most to consumers and they are responding globally with strong demand for NIKE. Accordingly, our full year guidance for fiscal year '19 reflects stronger currency-neutral revenue growth, stronger gross margin expansion and accelerated strategic investment. For the full year, we now expect currency neutral revenue growth to be in the high single-digit range, potentially approaching low double digits. Based on current foreign exchange rates, we expect reported full year revenue growth to be over 3 points lower than our currency neutral revenue growth. In other words, at the low end of the high single-digit range. For gross margin, our outlook has also improved. We expect our full year gross margin expansion to be roughly in line with the gross margin expansion of 70 basis points that we delivered over the first half of fiscal year '19. We expect SG&A for the full year to grow in the high single digits as we continue to invest in new digital capabilities that will differentiate NIKE and fuel our long-term growth. We project other expense, net of interest expense, to be between $50 million and $75 million for the full year. And we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens for fiscal year '19. That said, the finalization of regulations-related U.S. tax reform may result in discrete adjustments that impact our tax rate. While our focus is on sustaining profitable growth over the course of fiscal year '19 and for the long term, I will provide a bit of context on Q3 considering the current macro environment. In Q3, we expect strong currency neutral revenue growth squarely within the high single-digit range. Based on FX dynamics, our reported real dollar revenue growth will likely be roughly 4 points lower than our currency neutral revenue growth in Q3. For gross margin, we expect Q3 expansion to be roughly in line with our full year guidance. As for SG&A, we expect growth in the low double-digit range in Q3 as we continue to prioritize strategic investment. And finally, we expect our effective tax rate in Q3 to be between 16% and 18%. Our execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is driving consistently strong performance. Yet, we are still in the early stages. As we continue to execute, we're not only building current momentum, we're also gaining greater insight into NIKE's potential to transform the industry, drive sustainable growth and create extraordinary value for shareholders long term. With that, we'll now open up the call for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Lauren Cassel with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Lauren Cassel : Thanks so much and really nice quarter. I just want to ask about gross margin. So 70 basis points for the full year and in the third quarter. I think previously, you were expecting second half gross margin to be a little bit better than the first half. Is there anything that's changed or maybe just being a little more conservative given the macro backdrop? That's my first question. And then, maybe just talk to us a little bit about how much of the 9% growth in North America has been driven by ASP versus units? And perhaps given the robust innovation pipeline that you guys have, if there's an opportunity for that region to potentially grow a little bit faster than 3% to 4% over the long-term? Thank you. Andrew Campion : All right. Thanks for the question, Lauren. As for gross margin, I'll touch on that question first. We are expecting our gross margin to be better in the second half of the year. And as you note in our reported results, it was slightly better than we expected in Q2. We're seeing structural benefits to our margin from our over-indexing growth in Direct, which has had very strong momentum and momentum that's exceeded our expectations, specifically in digital, as well as a greater mix of premium innovative product and stronger full price sell-through. We're also benefiting from a clean marketplace, particularly for NIKE. So as noted in my remarks, we do have an improved outlook for '19 with our expansion been roughly in line with the year-to-date margin expansion of 70 basis points. And as we noted when we entered the year, we expect that the second half margin to be stronger than the first half. And in the first quarter, our margin expansion was lesser than in the second quarter. I would note that in any given quarter, there can be anomalies that impact margin. And finally, I'd note that, Q2 is a quarter in which our margin is historically lower. Q3 and Q4, we have higher margin. And so the expansion we expect in the third and fourth quarters is actually strong expansion on an already relatively higher quarterly margin. And then you asked about ASP and units. What I would note is that ASPs were up across our portfolio in both footwear and apparel. Again, new innovation, strong full price sell-through, our shift to Direct, clean marketplace are impacting ASPs. We see continued ASP expansion in our order book going forward. And so very balanced. Again, single-digit rates of increase in footwear and in apparel, with apparel ASP is even expanding a little bit stronger than footwear, but both strong. And then, like I said, balanced with strong unit expansion in both footwear and apparel. Lauren Cassel : Great. Thanks very much\u2026 Andrew Campion : Thank you, Lauren. Operator, we'll take the next question, please. Operator : Your next question is from Kate McShane with Citigroup. Your line is open. Kate McShane : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My question today was on Jordan. I know you don't talk or guide the magnitude of growth that you expect for a particular line or brand. But I wondered if you could talk generally the direction of what you expect for Jordan for the rest of fiscal year '19? And what are the key drivers that's going to be accelerating that growth? Mark Parker : Yes. As we said, the growth for Q2 was exceptional and we had a great start for Q3, with the largest product launch that we've ever had in our history. So that's a good signal right there. I think that the great story in Jordan is that we're managing the business more holistically between performance, product and retro. It's a clean market, a healthy market, particularly in North America. So we're in a good pull market situation now. We got great brand heat, I think, and that's really driven by strong product and storytelling. I mentioned the Concord of late. The PSG collaboration was a great source of energy that was kind of unexpected. But incredible sell-through in energy, not just in Europe, but around the world. So I think the potential in Jordan is the return to growth in North America and on the energy and the enthusiasm for the brand and the product around the world, and including and maybe I'll especially call out China there. And then, we have more potential as we diversify the portfolio of product, particularly around the Woman's offense in both footwear and in apparel. So again we're actually quite bullish on the future opportunities and continued growth for Jordan in the second half and beyond as we move into fiscal '20. Andrew Campion : And just to emphasize the point that Mark made, Kate, Jordan's growth was strong in the quarter and it was based on growth across all geographies. We had strong growth in North America as well as Mark said, very strong double-digit growth internationally. Kate McShane : Okay, great. Thank you. And if I could just \u2013 all right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from\u2026 Andrew Campion : Operator, we'll take the next question, please. Operator : Certainly. Your next question is from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Bob Drbul : Hi, good evening. I guess, just if we could stay on North America for a minute. I think you highlighted, I think, athletic specialty a little bit. Is the growth in the other channels having an outsized impact on this - the high single digit in this very strong outlook, can you talk maybe to some of the change to yourselves, and how you're doing in that area, please? Mark Parker : Yeah, I think the growth is - I mean, we feel really great about the growth in Digital as we've stressed continuously in our prepared remarks, but we also mentioned the increase on the wholesale side beyond expectations there. And I think that's driven by the elevation of the experience, the doors with, particularly with Foot Locker and Dick's for example. We're seeing - where we have invested in elevating and differentiating the retail experience for the consumer that we're seeing tremendous response. Obviously, the backbone of that demand and that response is great product. So we feel really good about that in terms of where we began this first half and then obviously with what's coming. But our - the strategic relationships with our bigger partners, who are really investing in the consumer experience is what we're seeing paying off. And we're bullish on that as we move forward. But, again, the big driver here is the combination of wholesale, including - in addition to our direct Digital. Bob Drbul : Got it. And I'm just curious if, in the Jordan business, there's some momentum there, has - did the Michael Jordan and Malik Monk little exchange, did that help the business at all coming out of the quarter? Or has it had no impact? Mark Parker : Well, any news is good news in a way. There is - a little bit of energy is always good. So we will take it. Andrew Campion : We'll take the next question, please. Operator : Your next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Paul Trussell : Congrats on the great results. Could you just give a little bit more detail on your confident outlook outside of North America? Certainly, we see it in the results, but certainly, there have also been other companies that are maybe flat incremental discounting or concerns around a slowdown in sneaker sales, both in Europe and in China. So if you can just speak in more detail to your success there? And then second, if you can just go back and maybe talk a bit more about the opportunity for more moderately price point products. I think you mentioned early in your comments. Just elaborate on where you see that opportunity from a geography or channel or stall opportunity? Thanks. Andrew Campion : Yeah. Sure. I'll touch on the first part of your question related to the momentum in China and Europe in contrast of what you referred to is what some others maybe saying in those markets. We're seeing extraordinary momentum in both markets. I'd say the headline in China is our growth continues to accelerate. We are the number one brand with consumers in China. We are brand of China, deeply connected with teams, federations, athletes. And, again, even the government to some extent, the Ministry of Sports in terms of our joint venture to fuel sport participation. We're seeing incredibly strong demand for our product, the innovation that we're launching, our Basketball product, our Jordan product. And then, as we've noted, our Digital business, both our NIKE Digital ecosystem and through our partnership with Tmall is fueling extremely strong growth. We have not seen any impact from our business from some of the U.S., China dynamics that we're all reading about. We're mindful of those. But in the context of being mindful of those, we continue to see very strong signs of momentum in China. As per Europe, very similar. Europe, we have great momentum. In both geographies, ASPs are strong, comp store sales are strong, closeout mix is low, inventory is healthy. In EMEA, in particular, we're taking significant share. That's also amplifying our growth. Mark Parker : Yes, the core footwear, let me touch on that briefly. We see basically our approach to complete offense. One of the things we look at is where are the opportunities on the offense to actually grow the business even further than what we see today. And core footwear, more excessively priced product in that core footwear zone, particularly in North America, but really around the world is a big opportunity for us. We're doing well with the business, but, we think, there's more upside opportunity. We want to leverage some of the platforms that we've introduced more completely with more accessible versions of those products for those products within those platforms, as well as actually creating unique innovation that is targeted towards that core, more accessible price point. And actually, amp [ph] up our storytelling around that product. We think that there's tremendous opportunity for us as well there. Andrew Campion : Operator, we'll take the question, please. Operator : Your next question is from Jamie Merriman with Bernstein. Your line is open. Jamie Merriman : Thanks. The first question is, Andy, you talked about that 30% Digital target that you laid out at Investor Day last year as maybe more of the mile marker. So I guess, can you talk about whether you think you will achieve that faster than what you had laid out? And then, what you think that ultimate opportunity is? And you used a reference 50% or 80% in other categories, I mean, how you get there? And then the second piece is, Mark, you mentioned that you're introducing RFID into footwear and non-licensed apparel. But how will that work with your wholesale partners who may or may not all have RFID capabilities? And what do you think that will enable NIKE to do? Andrew Campion : All right. Jamie, I'll touch on your question regarding our long-term vision for digital. Frankly, we're not taking a year-over-year incremental rate of growth approach to Digital. Looking out longer-term, we do see the potential to have Digital be the majority of our business. And as I noted, when we look to other industries, which you referenced, other industries, consumer products industries, not just Digital or content industries, but other industries ranging from toys to electronics, books, et cetera, we see that in each of those industries, there was positive disruption that catalyzed that shift. And as the leader in our industry, we're going to continue to invest in this digital transformation of NIKE, and even more importantly, a consumer-centric digital transformation of the industry. Some examples of that are the services that we're providing within our NIKE App, the sneaker's app, which really has been a source of explosive growth. Our membership program, which, we believe, is a uniquely compelling proposition within this industry in terms of the friction that it removes for consumers and the personalization that it gives our consumers. And then as Mark touched upon on the call, we think, driving digital penetration in our industry also has quite a bit to do with leveraging the power of digital in the physical retail environment. And again, as we always have as NIKE, we tend to catalyze that change by putting innovative new experiences into the market, that then catalyze the change not only within our owned store base because that's something within our control but that's an example for the strategic wholesale partners that we've referenced. In terms of the experience, we would like to see them continue to evolve. So we're very ambitious, but we see the goals is very achievable when you look at benchmarks in other industries. So again it's less about when we would get to the 30%. And it's more about our extreme confidence that, that we're going to go well beyond that number over the long term. Mark Parker : And quickly on RFIDs, connected inventory is a way that will enable us to meet demand - consumer demand much more effectively, more efficiently. We're going to be scaling RFID and product as I mentioned throughout 2019. We'll be working closely with our retail partners, obviously and obviously all of NIKE Direct so that when consumers is really looking for product, we're in a position to provide it if it's not in the store that they're looking for. So we think that this, as Andy pointed out with the example in Korea, that, we think, that the opportunity here to affect the consumer - satisfying consumer demand is going to be actually pretty significant throughout the year. And that's just going to grow across 2019. So we're very bullish on that. Andrew Campion : Operator, I think, we'll take one last question, please. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is open. Jim Duffy : Thank you. Happy holidays, everyone. Great to see the innovation. It's great to see the innovation being rewarded, but building momentum. I want to talk a little bit about the Women's business in the context of the size of the opportunity, that's very encouraging. What's been the big unlock with the recent success? I'm sure there's more to it than just the other [ph] amplified? Are you speaking the female consumers in a different way? Or is there some sort of structural or cultural tailwind that's strengthened recently? Mark Parker : Well, as we mentioned, women's is outpacing men's growth for the quarter, and we see that continuing as we move forward through the fiscal year and beyond. I think there's a number of factors. I think women are embracing sneaker culture. We're seeing that with some of the iconic franchises that we've had like the Air Force 1 that are actually designed specifically for women with deeper insights, that, I think, resonate. And that's one example, but that's true across the product offering. Using the insights that we gain in that connection that we have with the female consumer, we're creating better product and we're seeing that reflected in the demand. The capsule collections that we've introduced in apparel Nike Metallic Sheen was one, Terra Perma was another capsule collection. Great response to those. I think it's relevant product in the end. Compelling relevant product is the foundation of that demand. And then, I think, the brand is actually speaking to women more directly and personally. And as I said in my remarks, that's going to be amped up throughout this 2019 as we head towards World Cup. You're going to see Just Do It with a big emphasis on women's. And then sports is affecting lifestyle and fashion in a way that we're seeing dramatic impacts around the world. There's a real appetite for more active lifestyle and that's expecting fashion and what - the product that we're creating is more sensitive to that and we're seeing the response from that work. Jim Duffy : And you mentioned women's 25% of the business globally, can you speak about how that shakes out across the regions? Andrew Campion : Sure. It's relatively evenly distributed across the regions. And from a categorical perspective, it's largely comprised sportswear, running and training, which is, in part, why it's relatively well distributed across the regions. In terms of the rate of growth, it's outpacing in all geos, outpacing the men's business. Now in terms of where opportunity is, as Mark touched on, we've got tremendous momentum, and that momentum is opening the aperture in terms of our vision in terms of where incremental growth is longer term. The women's footwear and apparel market is 1.5 times the size of the men's footwear and apparel market globally; and as you noted, it's less than quarter of our revenue. So we see extraordinary potential to drive continued strong growth and even step change growth as we really do two things, open the aperture in terms of the definition of sport, again, that's with a sharp focus on women and movement and activity. And then second, editing and more aggressively shifting resources within NIKE towards the women's opportunity. So in short, we've got great momentum in the women's business, but we're chasing something much bigger. Andrew Campion : Thank you, Jim. Okay, that's all the time we have for today. Thank you all for joining us. Happy holidays. We'll speak with you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Now, I would like to turn the call over to Nitesh Sharan, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Nitesh Sharan : Thank you, Operator. Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal 2019 third quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, or at our Web site investors.nike.com. Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker, and our Chief Financial Officer, Andy Campion. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So, we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker. Mark Parker : Thanks, Nitesh and hello everyone. In Q3, our teams once again drove healthy growth across NIKE\u2019s complete portfolio, leading to balanced results in our key dimensions. In our geographies, for example, the continued growth in North America was fueled by NIKE Consumer Experiences, where we have our most direct connection with the consumer. China earned its 19th consecutive quarter of high-quality, double-digit growth, as the Chinese consumer increasingly makes sport a part of their daily lives. And the NIKE brand continues to accelerate in EMEA and APLA as we go deep into our key cities to seize new opportunities quickly. In innovation, we've led with bold platforms like Air Max in Sportswear and Adaptive technology in Basketball. We kept consumers coming back for more with a fast pace of fresh options in our Power Franchises. And with the energy for sportswear at an all-time high, NIKE continues to stand out in the active lifestyle marketplace through our authentic position in sports. And through our digital transformation, we\u2019re scaling the digital capabilities that\u2019ll serve consumers more personally and we\u2019re driving significant growth through our digital ecosystem making Q3 NIKE Digital\u2019s first billion-dollar quarter. Put together, all of this work led to strong results for the quarter. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 7%. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Inc. revenue increased 11%. Gross Margin was up 130 basis points to prior year and earnings per share was $0.68. Diving into the details, we launched some incredible innovation this quarter. Let\u2019s start with NIKE AIR. The major leaps we\u2019ve made in new designs for Air Max, like VaporMax and Max 270, continue to energize the consumer\u2019s ongoing love for the whole platform. Icons like the Max 95 and 97 and Tuned Air are a hit with both men and women. The Air Max Dia, our new women\u2019s-specific design, is performing extremely well across the globe. And the Air Max 720, a radically-unique silhouette, was released in a number of bold colorways, creating a strong consumer response right out of the gate. We don\u2019t, however, take this high demand for granted. It requires constant fine-tuning and the right balance of ceding and scaling to ensure a healthy position in the marketplace. But we know as long as we\u2019re making an impact with distinctive innovation like Air Max, our top platforms will continue to fuel our long-term growth. At the same time, we\u2019re delivering a faster cycle of fresh assortments of our power franchises. We do that by offering more options of colors and materials, inspired by more targeted and relevant storytelling and the strategy is paying off. For example, in our Sportswear category which continues to grow double-digits, the Air Force 1 is accelerating growth in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s. In the Jordan Brand, where the business grew at a very healthy rate this quarter, the Jordan 1 is a top-seller across all geographies. And in Basketball, we drove energy with the Kyrie 5 and LeBron 16 through multiple color ways and creative product storytelling. We also know that there are several untapped opportunities within our innovation agenda, and we\u2019ve intensified our focus to amplify them. For example, we are energizing the marketplace with statement innovation and going forward, you will see us bring more distinction at the core level. Specifically, for next fiscal year, we\u2019ve fast-tracked new collections under the $100 price point and we\u2019re aligning the merchandising and marketing teams to support them throughout the marketplace. Apparel, as we\u2019ve said, is another outsized growth opportunity. Over the course of the next year, you\u2019re going to see a sharper focus on key classifications in NIKE apparel. We\u2019ll accelerate growth by offering fresh options in our top-sellers, much like we do in footwear with our Power Franchises. Our goal is to provide great apparel for every step of the sport journey. For workouts, we\u2019re offering the best core items. This quarter, the bra business continued to expand and our athletic-take on Yoga apparel has moved us into a new market. For day-to-day life, we\u2019re designing for added versatility. This quarter, the new Tech Knit has been very successful, helping to grow Tech Pack unit sales nearly 200%, compared to last year. And to feed a passion for teams and athletes, we\u2019re offering premium product like the NBA Showtime Hoodie and then cascading to core level fleece, tees and shorts. In just our second year with the NBA, this is tracking to be the largest merchandising season in its history. We\u2019re at our best when we\u2019re leveraging Sports Moments through our athletes and league partnerships. And looking ahead, the sports calendar is full of moments to elevate, starting from today\u2019s first round of March Madness all the way through the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. In the next few months, we\u2019ll celebrate World Cup with our most innovative Team Kits and sportswear collections. In the spring marathons, we\u2019ll unveil the next generation of the Zoom X platform. And building on the energy of the NBA playoffs, Giannis will cap off his incredible season with the reveal of his first signature shoe. We\u2019ll also continue our streak of industry-defining innovation for the everyday athlete. We\u2019ll introduce a completely-new cushioning system designed to get more people running. In Women\u2019s, we\u2019ll launch more than 40 new styles of bras to expand our inclusive sizing considerably and building off the successful adaptive basketball launch this quarter, we\u2019ll expand the platform into new categories and embed the Adapt technology even further into our digital ecosystem. The innovation pipeline is full at NIKE and it gives us great confidence that we\u2019ll continue to win with consumers for years to come. While we view innovation as NIKE\u2019s number one competitive advantage, our Digital transformation will create even further separation. There are teams all over NIKE piloting new ideas and proving-out concepts. We\u2019re testing, learning and optimizing at an incredible pace. But the real key is to turn these new digital capabilities into growth at scale. There\u2019s a lot to talk about here, and I\u2019ll highlight a few areas that are leading to broad-based growth. First, we\u2019re supercharging NIKE+ membership for even greater personalization with consumers. When we offer more tailored product and experiences, we bring more value to the consumer and it opens up more opportunities to grow our business. So, this quarter we extended a new, advanced algorithm in our apps that allows us to reward our most active members. We added this data-driven format to the release of the NIKE App in Japan, and it help lead to the most successful launch ever. We continue to show how important membership is to creating an increasingly seamless physical to digital retail experience. In our House of Innovation stores in New York and Shanghai, over 50% of transactions are with members. Across our wider fleet, consumers using the NIKE App at Retail average 40% higher sales than those that don\u2019t. Our SNKRS app, in particular, continues to be a powerhouse in the world of digital commerce. For the quarter, SNKRS traffic and revenue were up triple digits. 17 of the top 20 SNKRS launches had 100% sell through. And during the record-breaking Air Jordan 11 Concord launch, our digital ecosystem showed its ability to handle scale and drive unrivalled energy processing on average 300 transactions per second. As a whole, our NIKE Digital business was up an impressive 36% in the quarter on a constant-currency basis. Another area where digital is creating company-wide efficiencies is within our product creation teams. We\u2019ve fully digitized our palette of over 6,000 footwear materials, allowing our design teams to build on one another\u2019s work and adapt to market trends more quickly. With fewer physical samples, it also plays an important role in minimizing our environmental impact. Overall, our advanced digital tools are reducing lead times, driving sustainability and leading to faster design cycles. The third highlight is how we\u2019re connecting the marketplace by digitally tagging and tracking NIKE products, all the way from production through retail. Our RFID initiative, for example, is improving product visibility and is an important step towards integrating our diverse ecosystem of physical and digital experiences, distribution centers and contract factories. This will give the consumer easier access to product and allow NIKE to more accurately match supply to demand across the world and ultimately fuel better, higher quality growth. We\u2019re seeing the early wins pile up in our digital transformation, and its bringing scale to every facet of our Triple Double Strategy. What\u2019s so exciting is the more we invest in stronger digital capabilities, the more growth opportunities we uncover. Today, the consumer rewards agility. The companies who adapt and scale first are the companies who grow fastest. To do that, NIKE is looking across the spectrum of the value chain from our factory partners to key cities, so we can take advantage of our most important opportunities. At the factory level, that means staging raw materials so they can be quickly deployed to fill requests for our most in-demand products. We did this in anticipation of LeBron\u2019s move to a new team last summer and it cut our jersey lead times nearly in half, except more of that with all the high-profile free agency moves this summer. But more broadly, this process is a critical component of our 2X Speed initiative and fuels our key city execution, so we can quickly adapt our assortments based on the demands of local consumers. The Express Lane is another important enabler to 2X Speed, continuing to scale and grow as a percentage of NIKE\u2019s overall business. In this quarter in our geographies, the Express Lane in Greater China was responsible for over half of the products in our Chinese New Year collection. In North America, the top ten styles in our NIKE App all came out of Express Lane. And in EMEA, it contributed to over 20% of our business. Express Lane is just one of the ways we\u2019re driving agility in our value chain to serve consumer demand. We\u2019re also investing in responsive manufacturing and faster delivery capabilities for our key cities. Overall, Q3 demonstrated the strength of NIKE\u2019s complete portfolio. The Consumer Direct Offense is connecting our powerful brand, to compelling innovation, to operational excellence, all in service of the consumer. And it\u2019s a strategy that gives us a very clear path to sustain that momentum over the long-term. This quarter, one of our greatest growth opportunities, our women\u2019s offense, experienced an important inflection point. I was fortunate enough to join our team in Paris for a powerful launch for the upcoming Women\u2019s World Cup, where we hosted some of the greatest athletes in the world. We were excited to unveil 14 National Team Kits for World Cup 2019, a tournament record for NIKE. The energy of the moment is building on our Dream Crazier, Just Do It Campaign, as narrated by Serena Williams. The campaign is a great example of how NIKE is leveraging the power of Social Media platforms to carry our message. Dream Crazier has broken several of our own consumer engagement records across all four geographies. For example, in North America, it\u2019s NIKE\u2019s most-shared Instagram post ever and one of the most-successful NIKE Tweets of all-time. In Greater China, the campaign reached 600 million views in just the first three days. This inspiring work from our brand teams is just part of our broader strategy to shift resources and accelerate our women\u2019s business. In product, we\u2019ve aligned our merchandising teams for one unified women\u2019s vision at retail and our R&D teams are quickly moving to create the platforms of the future. A more complete offense is taking shape and it\u2019s incredibly energizing. This quarter, you began to see the early results from those teams. Our NIKE One tight fueled our Training Tights business to strong double-digit growth. Plus Size bras launched this quarter and are off to an amazing start. Jordan women\u2019s is growing strong double-digits. And our women\u2019s sneakers offering is diversifying and growing with products that range from re-imagined retro styles like the Air Force 1 Sage Low and the M2K to new innovations like the Air Max 270 and the Air Max Dia. In Paris, the celebration of NIKE Women was unlike any moment I\u2019ve experienced. The best part is the work that we\u2019re doing this summer is just a start. We want to help create the next wave of growth for women in sport and with a fully-dedicated women\u2019s offense, we see an even healthier, long-term future for NIKE. It\u2019s a great time to be in the business of sport. The larger movement of health and fitness is growing the athletic apparel and footwear market all over the world. And we\u2019re excited about our role in fueling that energy and capturing even more of that opportunity ahead. Thanks, and now here\u2019s Andy. Andy Campion : Thank you, Mark, and hello to everyone on the call. In Q3, we once again delivered very strong growth and profitability, with 11% currency neutral revenue growth amplified by 130 basis points of gross margin expansion. Most importantly, our growth was high-quality, strategic and broad-based. Our execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is fueling strong demand across all four of our geographies, led by the 12 key cities that we believe offer the greatest platform to impact the world through sport and create Brand distinction. Our broad-based global growth is being fueled by four underlying strategic drivers; one, editing our product portfolio while amplifying the styles that consumers love most; two, doubling the cadence and impact of innovation that we\u2019re bringing to market; three, operating with greater agility; and four, transforming the consumer experience through digital. This is the Consumer Direct Offense in action, and the direct impact on NIKE\u2019s growth is tangible. First, by editing to amplify, we\u2019ve reduced the total number of styles in our portfolio significantly, while bringing much greater dimension and choice to what we call our Power Franchises. In any given season, our Power Franchises include select icons within Sportswear, such as the Air Force 1 and Air Jordan 1, performance franchises such as the Pegasus, as well as new innovation platforms such as the VaporMax, Air Max 270 and React. The new dimension we are bringing ranges from collaborations with athletes and influencers, to compelling new elements of design, to infusing new innovation into longstanding performance franchises. Second, we are well on our way to doubling the cadence and impact of innovation on our business. Once again, in Q3, new innovation platforms comprised of vast majority of our incremental revenue growth. And, as Mark said, our innovation pipeline is more robust than ever. In Q3, we launched the Air Max 720 to strong demand, as well as the Adapt BB on court in the NBA, which was a leap forward into the future of adaptive performance footwear. And we are scaling innovation faster than ever before with React and our new Max Air platforms being leveraged across multiple performance categories and in Sportswear within just the first year of launch. Third, we are bringing both innovation and our Power Franchises to market with greater speed and agility. Through our Express Lane initiative, we are using closer to market consumer insights to update key styles with new materials, print and colors on significantly shorter timelines. In Q3, product updated and fulfilled through our Express Lane drove well over 10% of our revenue. These efforts, editing to amplify, doubling the cadence and impact of innovation and operating with greater speed and agility, all come together with the greatest consumer impact through NIKE Direct. NIKE Direct is where the NIKE Brand experience comes to life in its fullest sense, and increasingly that experience is being elevated by digital. Once again, in Q3, our growth was led by NIKE Digital, which on a currency neutral basis grew 36% globally. We continue to expand our digital footprint with the launch of the NIKE App in Japan, and we continue to enhance our digital ecosystem through the rollout of the NIKE App in our own retail stores across North America and Europe. Our expansion is fueling the acquisition of new members at a strong double-digit rate, and the new experiences that we are creating are also driving strong double-digit increases in member engagement and buying. Our vision is to create direct, unbreakable relationships with our consumers. And we know the most direct connection is through the mobile device they carry with them everywhere they go. As Mark referenced, we are driving a digital transformation of NIKE with an emphasis on mobile. Over the balance of this fiscal year and through FY20, we will continue investing in this digital transformation. While many companies can build a technology stack, no other brand is able to leverage technology to create the kinds of amazing consumer experiences that only NIKE can. Our most significant investments will continue to be in the capabilities that enable us to better serve consumers and extend our brand leadership. These include investments in new digital member services, in data and analytics, in demand sensing technology, in technologies such as RFID that enable Connected Inventory across the marketplace and in a new editorial content engine that will keep us engaged with our members 365 days a year. More so than ever, our investments are directly translating into strong and sustainable growth. But before providing context on our positive outlook, I will first reflect on our Q3 results. NIKE, Inc. Q3 revenue grew 7%, up 11% on a currency-neutral basis. Our growth reflects double-digit currency-neutral momentum internationally and high-single-digit growth in North America. Gross margin expanded by 130 basis points in Q3 as average gross selling prices expanded, strong demand drove higher full price sales and higher margin NIKE Direct growth outpaced wholesale growth. Q3 gross margin was also favorably impacted by the shift of Supply Chain investments out of Q3 and into Q4. Demand Creation was flat in the third quarter as Other Demand Creation increased and Sports Marketing declined based on the timing of investments. Operating overhead increased 17%, driven by continued investment in NIKE\u2019s digital transformation, as well as year-over-year compensation related accruals. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.7% and third quarter diluted EPS was $0.68. As of February 28, inventories were up just 1%, reflecting a continued healthy pull market for NIKE globally and our stronger supply and demand management. With that, let\u2019s turn to some of the highlights across our reported operating segments. In North America, Q3 revenue grew 7% on a reported and currency-neutral basis. Sportswear, Jordan, NIKE Kids and Running, led our growth across the geography. From a product perspective, the majority of our incremental growth was driven by our Power Franchises ranging from the Air Force 1 and Air Jordan 1 to the Pegasus and Kyrie, to the Max Air family of products, including the new Air Max Dia for Women. As Mark referenced, the Jordan 11 Concord was also the biggest launch in our history with the product selling out in hours. The strength of our product portfolio and the fastest digital deliveries in our industry fueled a strong, or I should very strong holiday season for NIKE. In that we outpaced the broader retail market by roughly 2X. We also have very strong brand momentum in North America, fueled by the powerful Just Do It Dream Crazier campaign, which Mark referenced, as well as our executions around NBA All Star Weekend. Creating differentiated retail experiences remains a significant opportunity as the physical retail marketplace in North America continues to go through consolidation. At the same time, we are catalyzing the next generation of retail in North America. And that begins with Digital. NIKE Digital grew 30% in Q3, faster than all other channels. We are also disrupting the physical marketplace, in a positive sense, leveraging digital through new NIKE Direct concepts such as our House of Innovation in New York and NIKE Live in Los Angeles. Accordingly, our growth in New York and LA is over-indexing the broader market. We are also continuing to create new differentiated consumer experiences through the rollout of the NIKE app at retail in our owned stores and the testing of new services and concepts with our strategic retail partners, such as Foot Locker and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods. We expect our strong pipeline of innovative product, the brand heat we have created and an acceleration in our creation of new digitally-led consumer experiences to continue driving healthy growth in North America going forward. Now, let\u2019s turn to EMEA, where we continue to build extraordinary brand momentum. In Q3, revenue in EMEA grew 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by double-digit growth in Sportswear and Jordan. NIKE Digital led all dimensions of the marketplace, growing at a strong double-digit pace. One of the underlying drivers of our sustained growth in EMEA is the ever-increasing strength of our brand across this diverse geography. EMEA is home to five of our 12 key cities. In all five, NIKE is rated the #1 favorite Brand by consumers, and our growth is far outpacing the broader market. Take Paris, for example. Mark mentioned our Women\u2019s World Cup launch there last week, which was by all accounts powerful. It was just earlier this year that we launched the Jordan/PSG partnership, which drove incredible energy in this style, culture and football obsessed city. And of course, looking ahead, Paris will host the 2024 Olympics. It\u2019s a great reminder that our 12 key cities were not chosen based on size alone but instead, because we see these key cities as having the greatest potential impact on our Brand and business. In our APLA geography, revenue grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by balanced double-digit growth across both footwear and apparel. From a country perspective, growth was led by Japan and Korea, catalyzed by the great momentum we have in the key cities of Tokyo and Seoul. Across APLA, NIKE Digital is continuing to accelerate with revenue growing over 60% in Q3. We continue to expand our digital ecosystem across this region and leverage digital partnerships. As we look ahead to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, we could not be more thrilled with the momentum we are building in Japan. Both the SNKRs app and newly launched NIKE app are resonating strongly with consumers. Our Running innovation has also resonated with the highly discerning Japanese running consumer, with NIKE now having ascended to #1 in Running across Japan. So now let\u2019s turn to China. This past quarter, we delivered 24% currency-neutral revenue growth in Greater China, led by NIKE Direct, with digital commerce up over 60%. We have great momentum in China, but we are still far from realizing the long-term opportunity. On our last call, we spoke about four epic growth opportunities; International, Digital, Apparel and Women\u2019s. China is perhaps the best example of our outsized growth potential internationally. China is already the largest footwear and apparel market in the world, but athletic footwear and apparel represents a smaller share of total than in more developed markets such as the U.S. That said, within the broader market, athletic footwear and apparel is growing double digits in China. Sport has increasingly become more a part of life for consumers in China. While Basketball has long been popular with the Chinese consumer, we are now also seeing a Running boom. And, that is why NIKE has always been a Brand of China, for China. We have always believed that by being authentically connected to the Chinese consumer, we could help catalyze the rise of sport participation and sport culture in this market from sponsoring the Shanghai Marathon, to our partnerships with the China Super League, to working with the Ministry of Sport to expand physical education in schools. That is why, even amidst current geopolitical dynamics, NIKE continues to deliver strong and sustainable growth in China. That said we are not taking our current momentum for granted. Rather, we are more focused than ever on creating product specifically tailored to the Chinese consumers\u2019 preferences and fit and creating digital experiences that connect us more deeply to consumers through China\u2019s unique digital ecosystem. With that, I\u2019ll now share outlook for the remainder of fiscal year '19 and provide an early read on FY20. For the full year fiscal year '19, our outlook for constant currency revenue growth and gross margin continues to improve. At the same time, we will continue to invest in the capabilities that are fueling our strong sustainable growth. For Q4 specifically, we expect continued strong growth, with constant currency revenue growth being squarely in the high-single-digit range. It is important to note that we expect roughly 6 points of FX headwinds in Q4, which would result in low-single-digit reported revenue growth. As you may recall in Q4 of last year, we delivered 8% currency-neutral growth with 13% reported growth. In that quarter, the launch of new innovation platforms, such as React and the Air Max 270 began to materially impact our performance along with the impact of the World Cup. So our outlook for strong currency neutral Revenue growth this Q4 is a testament to the sustainability of the growth that we are delivering through the continued execution of our new offense. We also see the disparity between currency neutral and reported revenue growth peaking in Q4 before narrowing significantly as we enter FY20, based on current FX rates. Recall that during Q4 of last year, the euro approached $1.25, before depreciating to as low as 1.15 in Q1 of this fiscal year, a similar dynamic exists with respect to the renminbi. As a result, we currently expect the FX headwind on reported revenue to largely dissipate as we enter full year 20. For gross margin in Q4, we expect expansion of roughly 75 basis points, ending the fiscal year with gross margin expansion that will have exceeded our long-term financial model. While we expect continued strong full price sell through and strong growth through our higher margin NIKE Direct businesses, that is partially offset in Q4 by higher input costs, specifically cotton, chemicals and labor, FX sourcing headwinds and the shift of supply chain investments from Q3 into Q4. As for SG&A, we expect growth in the high-single-digit range in Q4 as we continue to prioritize strategic investments. We project other expense, net of interest expense, to be roughly flat in Q4. We expect our effective tax rate in Q4 to be roughly 18 to 20%. With the ongoing finalization of regulations related to U.S. tax reform, we have experienced volatility in our tax rate due to non-recurring items, which favorably impacted Q3 on a net basis. We will likely continue experiencing near-term volatility in our tax rate based on the finalization of regulations. That said, due to the uncertain timing of finalization, we have not factored all of the potential non-recurring impacts into our guidance for Q4. Now, let me share some preliminary thoughts on our positive outlook for fiscal year '20. We are still in the early stages of our annual planning process. That said our expectations are buoyed by our current momentum, our brand heat with consumers, our robust innovation pipeline and the positive early signals we are receiving from our NIKE Direct business and our strategic wholesale partners. Overall, we expect to deliver high-single digit revenue growth, as well as gross margin expansion and profitability in line with the long-term financial model we communicated at our Investor Day in October 2017. Of course, we continue to operate in a dynamic environment, so we will share more specific guidance for fiscal year '20 in our next earnings call. We are thrilled with our current momentum. That said, we are still in the early stages of executing the Consumer Direct Offense, with much more opportunity ahead of us. So, we will continue to focus our investments on the digital transformation of NIKE and in the areas of our business where we see the greatest potential to grow and create value for both consumers and shareholders. With that, we\u2019ll now open up the call up for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Omar Saad : I wanted to ask question on the Women's actually. We've noted some greater focus in the marketplace, marketing, messaging and the product side and there seems to be a lot of innovation, obviously, you talked about in the call as well. Maybe give us an update on where you stand on that opportunity, obviously, to keep focus of the company as important part of the long-term plan. Is it growing as a mix of the business, or is the men's business just too strong for women's at this point, still really become a more material next driver? And I had one follow up. Thanks. Mark Parker : Yes, actually, the women's businesses over indexing our men's growth. And we see me, as we've said earlier, tremendous opportunity moving forward. We are under indexed in terms of our percentage of business in the women's area, as you know. So, the upside there, particularly with the consumer, the market being bigger than the men's, is tremendous upside. We had a great quarter in Q3. The good news is driven by balanced growth, I think across footwear and apparel we had particularly great momentum in Greater China and APLA. So this is, obviously, a global opportunity. We see women embracing the sneaker culture more and more every day. So we're scaling up popular models and creating new models for women specifically and the response, like with the Air Max Dia, for example, one of the newer models has been tremendous also, great opportunity in a parallel. We've had real strong response to the NIKE yoga collection and the tight business, driven by the one tight, some innovation there as well. And as I said, the broad business is actually a great opportunity for us and we've expanded the broad collection considerably, particularly in the plus-size area of the business, and we're seeing strong consumer demand there. So, it's really an opportunity across all dimensions of our business. Jordan is another one. Women's in Jordan grew a strong double-digit number this past quarter. And the focus for us, it's a huge priority is editing and shifting the resources we have internally to serve women more completely. We're definitely looking at how we elevate our female athletes and influencers more completely, providing membership and access to sport, being very thoughtful in terms of design and our innovation agenda specifically for women. So again, simple conclusion there is under indexed opportunity for us at this point, huge opportunity for us going forward as we shift focus. Andy Campion : And Omar, an area in which we will deliberately shift investment from a product creation through the retail experiences is to accelerate against what we see as a tremendous growth opportunity. Omar Saad : Understood, that's helpful. And then while I have, maybe bigger picture on the digital capabilities, very clear the company has developed outstanding expertise in a lot of areas and learning how to scale it. When you look at the other brands in the portfolio Converse maybe isn't form as well. Is there something about the digital learnings you're developing in the NIKE brand that's scalable or not scalable across other brands in your portfolio? Is there a way we should think about that, because clearly working with NIKE brand? Andy Campion : Absolutely, lots of opportunities to leverage learnings in NIKE Digital across the portfolio; certainly, in Jordan, we're seeing tremendous success; as I mentioned, our speakers at platform; Jordan is a major part of that energy. Converse, we just launched Converse.com and the early response to that is incredibly positive and we see tremendous upside opportunity for the Converse brand as well. Overall, I think the brands in the portfolio, particularly Converse, Jordan and of course NIKE, are all lined up to share learnings and leverage, the expertise and the capabilities we're building in digital. So, we're going to see a lift I think across the portfolio. Operator : Your next question is from Jamie Merriman with Bernstein. Your line is open. Jamie Merriman : You've talked a little bit about in terms of the digital investments, the NIKE athletic retail. Can you talk about where you are in that process and what you're seeing in terms of response and connection from consumers as you've done that? That'd be my first one. Mark Parker : Well, first of all, obviously, digital is up significantly for the quarter. So we are leveraging what we're learning and its showing up in the results, up 36% for the quarter. I mentioned the SNKRS app. SNKRS app to me is really a signal of what the future potential of how we connect with consumers in a deeper way with storytelling as part of that effort. And then the connection we're making with physical to digital through NIKE Live in L.A. and then our house of innovation in New York and Shanghai. We're learning a lot. I mean every day we're learning and then we're applying those learnings to the rest of our business across our own direct business, but also in partnership with our wholesale digital partners at the same time. So, we're seeing a healthy lift. And we know membership is a key part of this as well. And the membership is really driving a lot of the increase and improved performance in direct retail same time, and we've seen some impressive numbers on that as well. Jamie Merriman : And then can you just talk a little bit about apparel in North America? You've talked about women's and apparel as being two areas, particularly where you're focused in terms of driving growth and clearly, seeing great results from women's. But can you just talk a little bit about the initiatives in apparel and specifically just wondering about North America as well? Thanks. Mark Parker : Well, first of all, we continue to see great momentum in our apparel business, not just in North America, but across all geographies. And it's a balance between both performance and sportswear. That said, we see a lot more upside potential, particularly as we 2X our innovation agenda in apparel. We see tremendous opportunity to start to echo much of what we've seen on the footwear side of the business. And we're putting particular emphasis too on the women's innovation agenda in apparel as well. So we've seen some early positive response to some of that product and some of those launches. But we've seen much more upside for apparel around the world really, for NIKE in both sportswear and in performance for women and for men for that matter. Andy Campion : Yes, just to add that one of the reasons we call apparel as such an extraordinary or outsize opportunity for us long-term is. Athletic apparel, as a percent of total apparel, is much smaller than is athletic footwear as a percent of total footwear. And what we're really focused on is the opportunity to go deeper in some of the classifications where we have been a player and had great response from consumers, but we haven't gone as deep as consistently. And that extends to offering product that is well suited for new occasions. Again, think apparel Monday through Friday, as well as on-court, in the gym and over the weekend. And then that extends to price points, up and down the price points from premium apparel through to the more affordable price points. So, we see a pretty extraordinary opportunity to both catalyze the growth of athletic apparel within the broader apparel industry, and also extend the offerings that we're bringing to market. Mark Parker : I'll just add that we're in the infancy stages of apparel opportunity on the Jordan side of the business as well as. We've seen a taste of the response to the women's apparel business in Jordan, but we see a lot of upside opportunity for apparel and their overall Jordan business. Operator : Your next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Paul Trussell : Good afternoon. I know it's early in the fiscal '20 planning process, so I appreciate the color given. But just wanted to see if there's any other puts and takes you can provide as we think about maybe the composition of the high-single-digit revenue growth outlook, as well as puts and takes on margins. In particular, your long-term algorithm is inclusive of slight leverage on SG&A, which we haven't seen this year. So just curious on how we should think about that going forward? Andy Campion : We're still in the early stages of our planning process, and I appreciate that you noted that. But we do have increasing confidence in the expectations that we've just shared for fiscal year '20. We have incredibly strong momentum and demand across both footwear and apparel brand heat and as we have shared, an incredible pipeline of innovation that both in the early part of the year, as well as in the latter part of the year as we ramp up to Tokyo 2020. We're already receiving very positive signals from our Nike direct business and our wholesale partners as I shared. All of these really contribute to our competence in our outlook for growth. Our outlook for growth is broad based. We expect growth largely in-line with the guard rails that we've shared in terms of our long-term algorithm across geographies. So continued momentum internationally, as well as continued healthy sustainable growth in North America. Keep in mind that we're operating in a dynamic environment, and so we'll update you with more specifics when we get to our Q4 call. As far as SG&A, we see the investments that we're making, translating into this extremely strong currency neutral revenue growth and margin expansion. And so, that correlation has probably been more direct than ever, which is leading us to continue to invest in the capabilities that are going to drive. The digital transformation we've spoken about and fuel that growth. Our investments in innovation, which we've spoken about and speed and digital, are clearly having a tangible impact. So we'll continue to make those investments. At the same time, as we said at our Investor Day, we do expect to be able to both make those investments and deliver slight SG&A leverage over that five year horizon. So that is very much still a goal in terms of the profitability of our business going forward. Mark Parker : And I'll quickly add that the growth that we're seeing that makes up that high single digit guidance at this stage is a very -- it's as balanced as I think we've seen it in terms of complete offense, men's and women's performance in sportswear, I think across the goes driven by the key cities, categories, price points, we do have some opportunity, I think in core, particularly as we head into fiscal '20 and you're going to see a whole refresh core offering from Nike that we think is going to help to fill in our complete offense there as well. And then as Andy said and we say all the time, that truly it's the innovation pipeline is full and I think it's going to drive some great upside for us. Andy Campion : And the only thing I'd add is I think it is important to note that a lot of investments that we're making are really long-term in nature. They have a compounding impact innovations platform that we can leverage, obviously, and scale faster over time, as well as the investments we're making digitally. As we've said before, from a long term perspective, we see digital comprising the majority of our business. And so these are investments that we think will have a compounding effect as we make them year-over-year. Paul Trussell : My follow-up is just to circle back on North America, and I think part of the question Jamie was asking, which was around the apparel. Is there anything from a timing standpoint that led to the deceleration in apparel in the third quarter and any other just comments you can provide in North America around what you're seeing with your wholesale partners? Andy Campion : Yes, very intuitive, insightful question. There were some timing impacts related to our NBA business and the launch of certain products year-over-year. There are always timing impacts in terms of product launches. So yes, nothing in terms of a turn or change in consumer demand. In fact, consumer demand for our apparel in North America is very strong. Frankly to some extent it puts pressure on supply, but that is that's a great point of pressure to have. We've got really strong demand for our apparel in North America. So I wouldn't overly index on the quarterly rate of growth. Operator : Your next question is from Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs, your lines open. Alexandra Walvis : You mentioned in response to the Paul's question that there was some work that you guys were doing, refreshing the core products and driving more growth across different price points. You also mentioned in your prepared remarks that you'd be giving more distinction to some of the core level products that products under $100. And you mentioned that you'd be introducing some new cushioning products to get people -- more people running. I wonder if you could dig a little bit more into or dive a little bit more into those strategies. And then more broadly, why is now the time to bring some of that product innovation and process innovation to those lower price points and broader consumer groups? Mark Parker : Well, it's basically a part of our ongoing complete offense strategy as we see where we have opportunities to improve our offerings and to create more opportunity. And certainly as we look at footwear or our complete footwear offering, not just in North America but around the world, we see the opportunity to strengthen the price to value opportunity for our footwear. So part of that is bringing innovation into that price point, not just taking it down but creating unique innovation for those price points and those consumers. We have to be competitive at every level. And I think as part of our offense and I think there's a great opportunity for us, and I think that can drive some of the under indexing in the marketplace now versus the opportunity. So yes, we have about three quarters of our product at the core level, and footwear is going to be refreshed starting in back-to-school. And it's not a takedown it's making sure that we have that value at that price point and again, creating some unique innovation platform opportunities. And as far as the new cushioning platform goes, I can't really talk a lot about it other than it's incredibly comfortable, and I think it is going to open up opportunity for part of the running population that actually we might not have at this stage, or at least invite more people in to it. I'm actually wearing a pair now. And I will tell you it's one of the most comfortable platforms that we've had, so incredibly exciting and visually very distinctive. Alexandra Walvis : My second question was on Jordan, the brand is back to strong growth and you've called out several drivers of it. I wonder if you could reflect on some of the actions taken there in the last year and a half or so to reset that North American market. How you're feeling about the health of inventory in the channel today and about growth opportunities for that brand going forward? Mark Parker : As you know, we had -- this time last year we're in a reset mode on Jordan. And we're very pleased with where we've come in terms of cleaning up the products in terms of the marketplace. I think we probably over indexed a bit on the retro market. We've got a rein on that, so it's a very balanced management of the Jordan product portfolio, not just in terms of retro but actually balancing that out with performance product as well. And that's the story in Jordan too is we're beginning to see a much more balanced product offering, both performance and sportswear, new performance platforms with retro and retro refresh, but making sure that we're managing that in terms of the marketplace. The inventory is actually quite healthy in a good position right now. Women's is just coming on. So I mentioned women's apparel, but also footwear for Jordan, a big opportunity for us. And there's a lot of great brands energy around Jordan right now, not just here in North America but around the world. It's APLA, EMEA, China, huge brand presence for Jordan in China. So again, we're bullish and we feel like, we've got a good rein on managing that in a healthy and balanced way. Andy Campion : And I'd just add that as we said, the demand for the Jordan brand has been strong, it was strong even when we are in a reset mode it still is strong. And our opportunity was to, as both Mark and others have said, bring new dimension to the brand. Mark touched on women's a couple of other areas of dimension performance basketball product. We've seen extremely strong demand for the Air Jordan XXXIII game shoe, which we amplified with the Chinese New Year and Travis Scott editions. We're seeing incredibly strong demand for Russell Westbrook's signature shoe, Why Not, also on performance silhouettes. And then as Mark touched on in response to the earlier question on apparel, the apparel coming out of Jordan is extremely strong and we see a big opportunity there. In fact, as I talked about in my prepared remarks, the Jordan PSG launch was largely an apparel launch. We did have footwear in that launch. But what was really a shock and surprise to consumers in a very positive way was what we were able to do with the Jordan Brand on football apparel. Operator : Your last question comes from Lauren Cassel with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Lauren Cassel : Just a quick follow-up on Paul's question, looking to 2020 on gross margin specifically. Are there any specific factors if any that would prevent 2020 gross margin from being up as much as they have been here in 2019? And then my second question just bigger picture. How do you guys view the resale markets roll, the StockXs, the Goats of the world, in the context of the overall industry? Do you think there would ever come a point in time where you partner with them directly, whether that'd be for collaborations or exclusive products? Just any thoughts on how you view that that portion of the market. Thanks so much. Mark Parker : Lauren, can you quickly repeat the second part of your question? Lauren Cassel : Yes, just how you guys view the resale market within the overall industry the StockXs, the Goats of the world. Do you think there would ever come a point in time where you collaborate with those sites? Mark Parker : We'll start with the gross margin question. As we communicated at our Investor Day, our goal, a very ambitious but we believe achievable goal, was to deliver as much as 50 basis points of gross margin expansion over the next five years. Obviously, in this fiscal year, we are exceeding that goal. And that's fueled by number of factors, very strong full price sell through, the continued outpacing growth in our Nike direct business. As we look ahead to fiscal year '20, as I said in our guidance, we expect gross margin to be largely in-line with the long-term objective that we communicated on Investor Day, which is again a robust amount of margin expansion, especially on top of what we've delivered this year. Much like this year as we get into the fiscal year, we may see opportunities to expand on that. Certainly, this year, we've just had incredibly strong brand momentum and incredibly strong product pipeline that have afforded us the opportunity to outperform in that regard. At the same time, it's important to note that there are a myriad of factors within gross margin ranging from the impact of real time foreign exchange rates to the timing of the hedges that we put on from a sourcing perspective. So we'll update you with more specifics when we get to our Q4 earnings call and gross margin. But suffice it to say we are really pleased with the drivers of gross margin expansion that we've had in this fiscal year. And as we shared we expect to see continued strong margin expansion next year. Andy Campion : And just quickly on the resale market. We're not focused on that slice of the market. At this time, we don't have anything to add to that. We're fully aware that we're a huge part of creating that market. And that's our focus is how do we deliver the innovation and the creative energy to the product that ultimately is going to create an opportunity there for others. Right now, we're looking at it but we have no plans in terms of partnerships or business strategy in that particular area. Mark Parker : Thank you, Lauren. And thank you everybody for listening in today. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Take care, bye. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. you may now disconnect.",

I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker. Mark Parker : Thanks, Nitesh, and hello and good afternoon everyone. NIKE delivered strong results in fiscal year '19 growing 11% on a currency neutral basis, which outpaced our expectations from the beginning of the year. Our results are further proof that the demand for sport performance and athletic lifestyle product is thriving and our consumer direct offense is capturing more of that opportunity every day.  What's most exciting is that we delivered broad-based growth through our complete portfolio. We saw that balance across our geographies, men's and women's and key categories. Overall fiscal '19 was the defining year for NIKE as we accelerated the high-impact capabilities of innovation, direct and speed that fuel our triple-double. Innovation continues to win with consumers not only in performance product but also in sportswear. In fiscal '19 new innovation platforms drove roughly 100% of our total incremental growth, which is exceeding the long-term target we laid out at Investor Day 2017.  In digital we know we're just getting started. NIKE is accelerating our digital advantage and that focus led to 35% digital revenue growth. Speed remains an incredible opportunity, and we're well on our way towards cutting our product creation cycle in half and we're investing in responsive manufacturing, connected inventory and optimizing data to capitalize on real-time consumer demand. And finally throughout the year, our brand connected emotionally with a wider audience in more meaningful ways.  Our triple-double, our focus on the triple-double is especially important in an environment like we're in right now, where geopolitical dynamics have led to trade tensions and foreign exchange volatility. We\u2019re certainly mindful of the risks, and more importantly we're in command of the conditions that are under our control. And that's serving the consumer and managing the leverage we have, delivering great products, engaging experiences and building our brand.  Our greater China business is the blueprint for how all those dimensions come together. We added more than $1 billion of incremental growth in the geography over this past year. We are and remain a brand of China and for China. NIKE is proud of the investments we've made and the relationships we've developed in energizing this marketplace. We're confident that we will continue to grow sport and our business in China for decades to come.  Now let's go deeper on the three capabilities that are NIKE's greatest catalysts for growth, and that's innovation, direct and speed. And I'll start with innovation. The consumer continues to tell us they want innovation to perform better as well as innovation that creates distinctions in their lifestyle product. Refueling that demand with styles like the Max 270, VaporMax and Max 720 which were amongst NIKE's top volume drivers for the year. The React platform too, expanded into sportswear led by the React Element 55, 87 and the Presto. In both React and Air innovations helped fuel sportswear to another 20% plus growth quarter in Q4. Looking ahead to fiscal year '20 we see great opportunity for both platforms to continue to carve out new space in the lifestyle markets.  In performance footwear, basketball accelerated in Q4. The greatest growth continues to come from NIKE's own digital platforms where we have the most direct connection with the passionate basketball consumer. And signature shoes continue to lead the way, with KD, LeBron and KYRIE all growing double digits. And next month were looking forward to adding another exciting personality to the mix with the addition of Giannis and his first signature collection following his incredible MVP season.  The Jordan Brand had a very strong year growing 12%. Jordan returned to a poor market in North America after we reset the marketplace earlier in the year. The Air Jordan 1 continues to be a global phenomenon, as we see success in both High Heat and In Line [ph] styles. In China we see a healthy balance between Jordan Lifestyle and performance product and we know there's still more opportunity for performance footwear in all geos. The new chapters of the Jordan growth story, apparel, women's and international are showing great potential. It's hard to overstate how important this year has been to the evolution of the women's offense at NIKE. The business grew double digits in fiscal \u201919, accelerating in the back half of the year.  Our momentum in women's a great example of how our renewed focus is really moving the needle through thoughtful designs, powerful brand messages, and digitally led distribution. You're obviously seeing it now with all the energy around World Cup.  To start the tournament nearly two-thirds of the teams wore NIKE kits and half the players wear our boots. The exposure is driving outstanding sell through in kits, high performance bras and lifestyle extensions. In fact, the USA Women's home jersey is now the number one soccer jersey men's or women's ever sold on NIKE.com in one season.  For me personally, the groundswell of support around the world for the athletes and teams has been truly inspiring. Tomorrow, all eyes are going to be on the U.S. versus France. I know I can't wait to watch these two NIKE teams in what should be one of the top matches of the tournament.  We're equally focused on delivering for the everyday athletes as we continue to fuel the broader movement of health and wellness around the world. Across the portfolio, we're serving women in more dimensions. This quarter we claimed the number one position in market share for bras in North America for the first time in NIKE\u2019s history.  Through [indiscernible], and women's specific sneakers like the Air Max Dia, we fueled sportswear, footwear and apparel to strong double digit growth this quarter. And we're expanding our inclusive size and collections with over 90 styles across run, train and live. And later this year we\u2019ll unveil geography specific women's apparel for the Asian market based on our research of body types and sizes.  One question I get asked a lot is how we plan to accelerate the growth in our Women's Business? In addition to the right product and inspirational brand experiences, the major unlock we see over the next several years is the opportunity that digital provides. Distribution is often one of our biggest barriers. And we continue to find that when we present product in a more future forward way, we\u2019re able to take the female consumer someplace new. And they're responding.  Our Women's Business in NIKE Direct and through our digital platforms continues to outpace our performance in the wholesale channels. Digital and where digital meets physical will be tremendous sources of growth in women's moving forward. Another massive opportunity that we continue to obsess is apparel. At NIKE we have a number of advantages in our favor that we leverage. We work with the best athletes, leagues and federations and we celebrate them through moments like the World Cup, leagues like the NBA and partnerships like Jordan and PSG. We have multiple categories that surface deep consumer insights.  Our apparel businesses this quarter grew double digits across basketball, training, and women's. And we have a world class design team that connects culture to sport in very creative ways. In fiscal year \u201819 we grew NIKE sportswear apparel over 20% into an over $3 billion business.  With our core footwear business, we've talked about the importance of refreshing our collections for today's demanding consumer. Looking ahead, we're doing that with a steady flow of new core footwear that features Air Max and Zoom Air and we will introduce more innovation in the space. One example being our Renew platform. You'll also see added retail support from many of the new collections in this price range. As we start fiscal \u201920, we're reloading with new platforms that will shape our innovation agenda for years to come. This week, we launched the new shoe that merges two of our most celebrated platforms, the Air Max React 270. And we have more hybrids in footwear on the way for the next several seasons.  In the end of Q1 we\u2019ll unveil Joyride, which is a platform that I'm incredibly excited about. This new approach to cushioning will deliver a more personalized feeling for runners at every level. I've been wearing different versions over the last year, and it's extremely comfortable. We think the design has great potential to stand out with the consumer in both performance and lifestyle. And finally, as we head into the back half of the fiscal year, we'll give full view into NIKE'S innovation pipeline for the Tokyo Olympics. We'll evolve 4%, a shoe that dominated metal stands [ph] into what we call next percent, which will deliver even greater measurable benefits to more athletes. You'll see sustainability that plays an even more elevated role in our design. And we'll deliver collections with more commercial potential than any other Olympics in our history. As we look ahead, these innovations will serve as the foundation for NIKE products and collections well into fiscal '21 and beyond. These platforms are the launchpad for the future growth of our company. Fiscal year '19 was also a year that we saw NIKE accelerate our digital advantage. I noted earlier that the 2X Direct is catalyzing our growth. Within Direct its digital, within digital, it's mobile. And within mobile, it's our apps. And all of this leverages and builds membership. Our investments are enabling us to identify and better serve our members personally, which is driving higher consumer lifetime value. We've just passed 170 million total members in the NIKE Plus ecosystem ahead of the pace we communicated at Investor Day. The sneakers app has become an incredible asset to our brand, with users checking in daily, and has acquired more new members than any other digital channel for NIKE. For the fiscal year, sneakers more than doubled his business, doubled its number of monthly active users, and now accounts for roughly 20% of our overall digital business. The NIKE app, our most comprehensive one stop shop for NIKE products is quickly expanding with triple digit revenue growth in Q4. And in the first half of fiscal year '20, we will launch the NIKE app in China and in 13 new markets in EMEA. This will be an incredible addition to our business through a potential pool of hundreds of millions of new members. The digital opportunity alone is tremendous. But just as promising is how digital and physical environments are intersecting and amplify each other. Our most effective test case thus far has been the NIKE app at retail, which links features of the NIKE app to our physical retail experiences. The NIKE app at retail is live in over 30 doors across the U.S., the UK and France. And we'll be scaling considerably throughout fiscal year '20, including in select factory stores. A few of the insights that we gained in our early pilots are that physical retail can be an exponential driver of membership. Product scans in-store often fuel online purchases later. And in-store exclusive offers through mobile tend to drive higher conversion rates and outsized spending. We're in the early stages of this elevated way of serving the consumer in our own environments. At the same time, we're moving quickly to scale these features and connecting inventory with our wholesale partners. A stronger use of digital and physical retail is everyone's opportunities. Seamless, frictionless shopping is what the consumer expects today. This quarter, we introduced a new digital concept to address one of the most significant problems consumers face. And that's sizing in footwear. Our solution NIKE Fit scans the foot either through your smartphone camera, or through an in-store experience. We believe a more accurate understanding of a consumer size will not only minimize returns, reduce costs and drive healthier growth, the insights we gain will also improve the way NIKE designs and manufactures product. We're excited to roll out NIKE Fit in the U.S. and EMEA later in 2019.  Our success through digital also relies on getting product to market faster. One way, we do that is through more responsive manufacturing. This summer we're making a significant investment in our manufacturing capabilities with an additional NIKE Air manufacturing center here in the United States. The consumer demand for NIKE Air is currently outpacing supply. This investment will help us better meet that demand and accelerate new innovations for one of our most distinct platforms. We will have more details coming in July. We also continue to build our capabilities in data and analytics, digital demand sensing and connected inventory to create a supply chain that anticipates and response to shifts in consumers demand quickly. Beginning in Q1, we placed RFID in nearly all NIKE footwear and apparel, which is hundreds of millions of products. RFID gives us the most complete view of our inventory that we have ever had. It's quickly becoming the most precise tool in our arsenal to meet an individual consumer specific need at the exact right moment. We will go live with this capability in Q1 across 20 NIKE Direct stores and then continue to scale across the fleet. Our sharper understanding of what's selling will also continue to inform our express lane, which is already driving higher full price sell through and better gross margins. In EMEA the Express Lane now totals over 20% of their business. A smarter use of data is also providing even more value to our most engaged NIKE consumers. One new model we're testing offers concept car footwear innovation from NIKE's leading designers to our most valued members in North America. This is a great opportunity to leverage member insights to serve them better and inform which products to scale. Finally, 2019 was a year in which the NIKE brand rose above and connected emotionally with consumers on another level. We broke through with a number of Just Do It campaigns that\u2019s celebrated our athlete's strengths. Over the course of fiscal '19, Just Do It generated an unprecedented 1.5 billion consumer engagements across our geographies and versus last year Google search volume for the words NIKE and Just Do It increased well over 100%.  This quarter we also released our Impact Report showing the various ways that NIKE is taking meaningful action to protect the future of sport. We're working with communities of young people to increase activity with programs like Made to Play that reach 16 million kids. And we are investing in the training of over 100,000 coaches this year to mentor girls worldwide. We're also minimizing our environmental footprint with a target of 100% renewable energy globally by 2025. We are driving sustainability at scale through recycled material in our aerosols, which is diverting 50 million pounds of waste from landfills each year. These are the kinds of steps and transparency that consumers expect today and as we share our stories we're bringing even more dimensions and value to the NIKE brand.  NIKE itself, in making amazing products, inspiring through an iconic brand and leading through digital advantage. We're pushing the pace in all three facets and ended up with a formula for creating strong shareholder value. We're proud of the results our team delivered in fiscal '19, but more importantly, with an earnest future were confident that NIKE is investing in the right areas to extend our competitive advantage and continue to deliver sustained growth over the long-term.  With that here's Andy. Andy Campion : Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon everyone on the call. As we close fiscal year '19 and we look ahead to fiscal year '20 three key themes stand out from the financial perspective. First NIKE is a growth company. Growth is how we measure the value we're creating for consumers and growth is paramount in terms of how NIKE creates value for shareholders.  Second, NIKE's growth is being fueled by strategic transformation. Transformation is about deliberately driving acceleration toward what you aspire to be in the future, not about just extrapolating what you are today. Accordingly, transformation requires innovation, it requires continuous learning and it requires investment. Third, especially in times of geopolitical and FX volatility NIKE's currency neutral financial performance provides a clear view into our fundamentally strong growth, expanding profitability and potential to create extraordinary value for our shareholders.  Let's first go a little deeper on growth. At our Investor Day in October 2017, we said that our new consumer direct offense would generate high single digit revenue growth on average over the next five years. In our first full year executing this new strategy we accelerated out of the box, with growth in fiscal year '19 that exceeded expectations.  For the full year NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 11% on a currency neutral basis and 10% in the most recent quarter. At NIKE Scale that is roughly $4 billion of incremental revenue in just one year. Our growth is also broad-based with all four geographies growing at or above the long-term targets that we communicated for each geography at our Investor Day.  Now that brings me to the second key theme. Our growth is being fueled by a strategic transformation of NIKE globally. At our investor day we said that over the next five years, we aspire to double the cadence and impact of innovation, to operate with greater speed and agility and to double our direct connection to consumers, leading with digital. These three pillars of our strategy were designed to drive global transformation and growth across our 12 key cities and 10 key countries.  To help gauze the quality and impact of our growth, we also communicated several key measures of success. Today we are on pace to exceed on all of those measures. Take for example innovation. In fiscal year '19, we've already doubled the percentage of total revenue generated by recently launched innovation platforms as compared to fiscal year '17. We are delivering 2X innovation by prioritizing investment in platforms like React and Air that have greater potential to scale across both performance in sportswear. As for Direct we are also ahead of pace, NIKE Direct drove roughly 50% of our incremental revenue growth in fiscal year '19, with NIKE digital growing 35% for the full year. Digital commerce own and partnered is on track to comprise at least 30% of our business by 2023. And longer-term we see digital driving the majority of our business. This kind of transformational growth doesn't happen by accident transformation requires investment.  In fiscal year '19, we invested over $1 billion in new capabilities and consumer concepts that include significant investment in the sneakers app, the NIKE app, new store concepts leveraging digital, our NIKE Plus membership platform and enterprise wide data and analytics capabilities that are helping us serve NIKE consumers in new and better ways.  With these long-term focused transformational investments, equating to nearly all of our incremental SG&A versus prior year we're clearly also editing and shifting within our legacy expenditures. As for the sneakers app we acquired Virgin Mega two years ago, a little over two years ago and have since invested organically in the team, digital tools, content creation and the geographic rollout of sneakers into 22 countries, and the returns on our investment has been extraordinary. The sneakers app that has accelerated from less than $70 million in revenue in fiscal year '16 to an annual run rate of over $750 million based on Q4 fiscal year '19 performance. We also invested significantly in the NIKE app. The NIKE app has extraordinary growth potential offering broader mobile access to NIKE's portfolio of products. In North America, NIKE app revenue is growing triple digits and we're just starting to roll out globally. As Mark mentioned, we'll launch the NIKE app in greater China in fiscal year '20. We're also investing in new store concepts that leverage digital including our two new houses innovation in New York and Shanghai and the smaller digitally enhanced format NIKE Live. These store concepts are exceeding plan revenue as they bring to life new ways of serving the consumer through the use of the NIKE app at retail. That brings me to the six significant investments we're making in our NIKE Plus membership platform. These investments have been largely organic, focused on building capabilities that help us know our consumers better to serve them in new ways.  That said, we also acquired both Zodiac and Invertex roughly one year ago, to accelerate our membership offense. Zodiac has accelerated our ability to measure the impact of targeted service and product offerings on an individual's consumer lifetime value. While Invertex brought us computer visioning and volumetric based data and analytics that helped us create and bring NIKE Fit to market within just one year.  As I said earlier, the third key theme from a financial perspective is that in times like these, NIKE's currency neutral financial performance, offers a clear reflection of NIKE's fundamentally strong growth, expanding profitability and potential to create value for shareholders.  18 months ago, it appeared that harmonized global growth was beginning to turn foreign exchange into a slight tailwind for NIKE. However, geopolitical dynamics over the past year have led to dollar strengthening fueled largely by uncertainty around Brexit and U.S. China trade. So within fiscal year \u201819, alone, dollar strengthening drove FX headwinds of over $1.4 billion on our reported revenue versus our plan entering fiscal year \u201819 and nearly $300 million in EBIT after taking into account our hedges.  We know that the foreign exchange headwinds of late may be transient. So we've remained primarily focused on the levers we can control in executing our strategy. And you see that in our currency neutral performance. Our strong currency neutral growth and margin expansion reflect NIKE's brand heat and distinction in North America and in all key international markets. The strength of our product portfolio and the transformation we're driving in the marketplace leveraging digital.  Our SG&A growth in fiscal year '19 was a function of accelerating the investments required to drive transformation while gaining leverage in our core legacy expenditures. We are editing and shifting to gain leverage most notably within our geographies, where we're creating differentiated consumer experiences leveraging digital while optimizing on differentiated retail.  That includes, for example, shifting many wholesale customers to what we call NIKE.net, an efficient digital platform for buying at wholesale. We're also testing new digital business models with respect to off price sales and optimizing our NIKE factory store fleet. Over the next three years, as we scaled it digital and drive more focused growth, we will increasingly edit and shift resources in targeted areas.  One key financial measure that reflects NIKE's unrivaled ability to turn strategic investment into competitive advantage and growth is return on invested capital. In fiscal year \u201919 NIKE\u2019s industry leading adjusted ROIC expanded over 400 basis points. Going forward, we see continued strong growth, expanding margins, and high returns on invested capital as we drive strategic transformation at NIKE through the consumer direct offense.  But before I share outlook for fiscal year '20 let's briefly touch on our strong Q4 results. NIKE Inc. Q4 revenue increased 4% on reporting real dollar basis and 10% on a currency neutral basis, with both meaningfully exceeding the expectations we communicated 90 days ago. For the full year NIKE Inc. revenue increased 7.5% on a reported basis, as strong 11% currency neutral growth was partially offset by FX headwinds.  Gross margin expanded 80 basis points in Q4, also exceeding our guidance. Margin expansion was driven by strong full price sales, enhanced product profitability and NIKE Digital growth. For the full year gross margins expanded 90 basis points. SG&A grew 9% in Q4, and 10% for the full year as we drove brand distinctions, and heat through the Just Do It Dream cape crazy campaigns and by amplifying the biggest moments in sport, while accelerating our investment in NIKE's digital transformation.  Our effective tax rate was 20.4% for the quarter, and 16.1% for the full year, slightly above our guidance driven by earnings mix and quarterly volatility associated with the continuing impacts of U.S. tax reform. Fourth quarter diluted EPS was $0.62 and full year diluted EPS increased to $2.49. As of May 31 inventories were up 7% reflecting continued strong full price sell through and tight supply and supported strong forward looking demand.  Now let's turn to the financial performance for our operating segments. In North America, Q4 revenue grew 8% on a currency neutral basis with NIKE Digital leading all channels have strong double-digits. Well, NIKE Digital continues to power our growth. NIKE is also growing double-digit and gaining significant share with our strategic wholesale partners. That includes strong double-digit growth for NIKE within Foot Locker, Dick's Sporting Goods and Nordstrom. Growth and share gains within these leading wholesale partners reflect NIKE's branding distinction in North America, and the strength of our product portfolio.  Our footwear innovation continues to resonate and in apparel we see very strong demand. In some classifications so strong that it's putting pressure on our supply short-term. For the full year, North America's revenue increased 7%, amplified by strong gross margin expansion.  Now let's move to EMEA where the NIKE brand continues to lead and drive meaningful separation. Revenue grew 9% in EMEA on a currency neutral basis in Q4, driven by double-digit growth in NIKE Direct across footwear and apparel and in all territories. In EMEA, the NIKE brand is stronger than ever. We're the number one brand in all five key cities in this region. And as we speak, we're creating an even deeper emotional connection to consumers through the Woman's World Cup in France.  NIKE Digital continues to lead in EMEA, up 35% in the fourth quarter. Yet EMEA is another market where we are truly just getting started. As Mark mentioned, we will more fully leverage the power of mobile, launching the NIKE App into 13 additional countries in fiscal year '20.  The strength of the NIKE brand in EMEA is also translating into strong double-digit growth and significant share gains with our strategic wholesale partners, most notably JD and Zalando. Note that our strong overall growth in EMEA in Q4 was also comping strong football apparel growth in the prior year fueled by the men's World Cup. For the full year, currency neutral revenue grew 11% and was amplified by strong gross margin expansion. On a reported basis, fiscal year '19 revenue grew 6%.  Next, let's turn to Greater China, which grew 22% on a currency neutral basis in Q4. This marks the 20 consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in China. Growth was broad based across men's and women's performance in sportswear and led by digital. NIKE digital grew 37% in Q4, fueled by the sneakers app and the strength of NIKE branded experiences with partners such as Tmall and WeChat. For the full year revenue in Greater China increase 24% on a currency neutral basis. On a reported basis, FY19 revenue was up 21%. We see continued strong growth in China in fiscal year '20. As a brand of China for China, we are building deep and meaningful relationships with the Chinese consumer.  We're investing in our local team and talent, creating products specifically designed for the Chinese consumer, sponsoring China's top athletes federations and team and working closely with the Ministry of Sport and Education to fuel the passion for an increasing participation in sport and fitness in China. On that note, we're excited to amplify consumer's passion for basketball around the FIBA World Cup coming to China in Q1.  Let's turn to APLA, where Q4 revenue grew 9% of the currency neutral basis. Growth was strong across nearly all territories. NIKE is a number one favorite brands in all 3 of our key cities in this diverse geographies, Tokyo, Seoul and Mexico City. NIKE is also the leading brand in Southeast Asia growing strong double-digits. Our growth in APLA is led by digital fueled by the entrepreneurial mindset we're taking with digital partners such as ZOZOTOWN, Flipkart and others.  Looking ahead to fiscal year '20, we will signify expand out our NIKE own digital footprint through the scaling of our app eco system.  For the full fiscal year APLA revenue increased 13% on a currency neutral basis and 2% on a reported basis, and finally at Converse fiscal year '19 revenue increased 3% on a currency neutral basis and 1% on a reported basis, fueled by China and Converse's new digital commerce platform. Looking forward, we have a new energized leadership team at Converse focused on fueling growth through product diversification, including reigniting Converse's authentic brand positioning in basketball. And that begin with the launch of the All-Star Pro BB basketball shoe in Q4.  With that let's turn to our outlook for fiscal year '20. Our taxes intensified over the past couple of months, creating more of a headwind on a reported basis, then we envision when we spoke with you last quarter. That said, our currency neutral outlook continues to improve taking these offsetting dynamics into account, we are reiterating our guidance for fiscal year '20. Our outlook for full-year reported revenue growth remains in the high single-digit range slightly exceeding our reported revenue growth in fiscal year '19. We expect another year of broad-based growth with all four geographies delivering on our long-term financial model.  As for gross margin we expect expansion potentially approaching 50 basis points. To be clear, we see continued strong operational margin expansion that would otherwise exceed our long-term financial model but for two items, foreign exchange, and strategic supply chain investments such as RFID and expanding Air manufacturing innovation will create a roughly 50 basis points headwind on margin. That headwind is factored in to our guidance. As for SG&A we currently expect strategic investment, offset by productivity initiatives to result in very slight SG&A leverage in fiscal year '20. SG&A should eventually grow in line with revenue growth. As for OIE net interest expense we expect $50 million to $100 million of income for the year. We see our effective tax rate, in the mid to high teens range. That said we expect continued quarterly volatility based on the publishing of guidance relative to U.S. tax reform and other discrete items.  Our primary focus is on the full-year and long-term. However, I'll provide a few specifics with respect to dynamics impact in Q1. In Q1 we expect reported revenue growth in line to slightly above our reported revenue growth in Q4. We expect currency neutral revenue growth squarely within the high single-digit range, offset by four points of the FX headwinds. Based on current FX rates the FX impact on revenue should largely abate from Q2 forward. It's also worth noting that in Q1 of fiscal year 19, we were already scaling React and Air Max 270 which had been launched in late fiscal year '18.  Now in fiscal year '20 we will launch Joyride at the tail end of Q1 with scale and the launch of other new innovative products coming from Q2 forward. As for gross margin we expect to deliver flat to potentially 25 basis points of gross margin expansion in Q1. This reflects very strong underlying margin expansion fueled by NIKE direct growth and strong full price sales. That said FX will be an anomaly with gross margin in Q1. FX will be a 50 to 70 basis points headwind based on year-over-year foreign exchange rates, which moved significantly within Q1 of last year, as well as the timing of our hedge gains and losses.  Assuming current rates we expect the impact of FX on margin to be much less material over the balance of the year. As for SG&A we're projecting growth in the high single digit range in line with the rate of currency neutral revenue growth. As for OIE net of interest expense we expect roughly $0 to $15 million of income in Q1 and we see our effective tax rate in the mid to high teens range in Q1. As we enter fiscal year '20 we are poised for another year of strong sustainable profitable growth and value creation. The NIKE brand is stronger than ever. We have a robust pipeline of innovation to bring to market. And we will continue to strategically transform NIKE and extend our digital advantage.  With that will now open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Bob Drbul : Hi, good morning. Good afternoon, sorry. It's been a long day. I guess just the first question I have is on China, I was just wondering if you could, go a little deeper in terms of strength of basketball and China apparel running. And just sort of what you see on the ongoing basis with the strong results and your expectation. I think you said continued growth the next decade. Just are you seeing any pressure there from the consumer around American brand?  It doesn't appear so in the numbers, but I just wonder if anything's changing, from that perspective. And just wondering if you could maybe just update us a little bit on how you guys are thinking about, some of the trade discussions that continue to unfold here in the U.S. Mark Parker : Great, thanks for the question, Bob. Firstly, your first question, which was around the drivers of growth in China categorically. The short answer is over the course of fiscal year \u201819. All categories real growth in China with the exception of global football, and that relates to the comp versus last year's World Cup. The primary drivers of growth of the biggest drivers of growth. We're making sportswear, basketball, Jordan, running group training, but in general, extremely broad based across men's and women's and while led by digital, also broad based across the marketplace. And then to your question about seeing impact from the U.S. China dynamics of late we have not seen any impact on our business to-date. And we continue to see strong momentum as we enter fiscal year \u201820.  The consumer sentiment around NIKE in China has been actually quite strong. We've made a lot of effort through the years to connect with the marketplace to take insights to use to drive innovation and messaging that is really, as we said, urban for China. So we're seeing that continue. And it's showing up in the results. I'm really proud of the team in China, we have and the complete offense kind of results that we're seeing coming out of China. Bob Drbul : And just on basketball. I just wonder if I could just zone in on a follow up. But it sounds as if NIKE has capitalized on the NBA jersey opportunity, recently created by designer RJ Barrett, ahead of the NBA free agency, what raw material colors have you guys staged, blue and orange or purple and gold? Can you just give us some insight in terms of how you\u2019re positioning for this weekend and the next few weeks? Mark Parker : Good one. Okay. You obviously figured out March [ph] in my hometown? Yeah. Right. You got the coast covered? Well, okay. We got the spectrum covered -- the color spectrum. So we're ready for anything, certainly blue and orange, and purple and gold. But, yeah. No other insights other than I think we got the bases covered. Yeah. Thanks Bob. Bob Drbul : Thank you. Good luck. Nitesh Sharan : Thanks, operator we\u2019ll take the next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Lauren Cassel with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Lauren Cassel : Great, thanks so much. Could you maybe quantify the impact that the supply chain investments had on gross margin during the fourth quarter? And then my second question is just where do we sit here at the end of the fiscal year in terms of your manufacturing exposure to China? What percentage of that is coming into the U.S.? And then just any, any commentary on -- if he wouldn't raise prices, et cetera, should this go through? Andy Campion : I'll take your first question on supply chain investments. The short answer is roughly 30 basis points in the fourth quarter. And just to clarify, those, that is because we capture investments that may be for the long term and our other cost of goods sold within margin. So it can be somewhat distorted in terms of current quarter product profitability. Mark Parker : And Lauren, your second question again, sorry, was pricing levers with respect to China is that\u2026 Lauren Cassel : Yeah just the current manufacturing exposure to China? I think you guys have been, actively sort of trying to diversify just where do we sit at the end of the year and how much of that is coming into the U.S.? Andy Campion : Sure, I'll take that one as well. We, we continue to source product in China. We continue to source product in China. We do externally report that we produce about a quarter of our product in China for the globe. Our exposure in terms of product produced in China to North America is relatively modest. At the same time we see a great opportunity to continue and potentially expand the production of product in China, for China and for other markets.  The short of it is we've got a relatively agile approach to sourcing multiple nodes from a production and distribution perspective. And so while the dynamics are certainly -- while it is certainly dynamic out there with respect to trade, we're relatively well positioned as we always have been for macro dynamics. Mark Parker : And we see China continuing to be a critical part of our source space. For China, but also other parts of the world that will continue. Thank you, Lauren. Lauren Cassel : Thank you so much. Nitesh Sharan : Operator will take the next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Nagel : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions, I appreciate it. So of course, I want to talk a bit. We -- there -- clearly your currency neutral results were quite strong here, actually, very strong. There were indications of weakness elsewhere in Southwest in the United States. The question I have on that is, as you look at the data closer than we could, was there any more -- were there any more top line challenges through the period that maybe not been totally reflected in the aggregate results? Andy Campion : One challenge from a top line perspective is frankly a nice problem to have, Brian, which is, as we enter the year we've got a particularly strong demand. Its broad based and a couple of years where we have very strong demand relate to Air, NIKE AIR, which is obviously a distinctive innovation relative to NIKE. So to your point about dynamics out there in the marketplace, we've got an innovation that is obviously closely tied to and really powerful within our portfolio that being NIKE AIR. And as Mark mentioned, in his remarks, we are actually expanding our investment in Air manufacturing in the U.S., and that is directly related to demand that we weren't able to fully capture in the second half of this past year.  In other areas and apparel got very strong growth in apparel. And we're ramping up supply with respect to a few classifications where our revenue growth could have been greater based on the demand in the marketplace, particularly around fleece.  And then just overall, when we speak about our growth, we said that it's not really an extrapolation. It's not really just a correlation to what's going on in the market. It's about a transformation in NIKE. And most notably, that transformation is being fueled by innovation. So we're creating something new and different in the marketplace and digital. Again, we're creating something new and different in the marketplace in terms of the digital connection we have with consumers. Mark Parker : A couple of other areas I call out quickly. There's the performance has actually been very strong. But I think there's more opportunity for us going forward. I mentioned women's and how we have double-digit growth for the year and it's been accelerating through the fourth quarter. But we're actually very bullish on the opportunity in women's going forward as we move into fiscal '20.  And then also called out core product under $100 price point products within footwear. And we have a whole refresh coming in the sort of core zone, not only with existing technologies being leveraged in that space, but unique design work that is going to refresh about 75% of that the styles in that product zone for NIKE. So that's going to create some more opportunity for us. Brian Nagel : That's all. Andy Campion : Thank you, Brian. Brian Nagel : I appreciate the detail. Thank you. Nitesh Sharan : All right. Operator, we'll take our next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Omar Saad : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Two questions actually, I wanted to ask first about your comments on RFID inventory, sharing the inventory in the wholesale channel. Kind of wondering what you're thinking about longer term, how you see inventory and inventory management evolving. What the opportunities are to either manage it differently, especially as you talk about matching kind of more diverse consumer demand more accurately?  And then my second question on the SNKRS app, obviously explosive growth there. How do you think about as you scale that platform, I don\u2019t know the saturation is the right word but how do you keep that growing and also keep it special and did you see, how big is that runway to create those unique experience for consumers through that platform before it starts to lose the special? Thanks. Mark Parker : Let me just touch on the RFID question first Omar. As I mentioned you were launching RFID across essentially we're in apparel beginning in the fall '19 season and that\u2019s going to enable all the footwear, the majority I should say of non-licensed apparel, through RFID and there QR technology. So that\u2019s a big upside for us in terms of our capability to dramatically improve our inventory visibility and accuracy. I think across the marketplace and throughout the supply chain. And ultimately that's going to allow us to serve consumers with the product that they want, when they want it. So the consumer up upside on this is actually quite powerful. And then we're going to rollout through fiscal '20 and scale the capabilities that we have within RFID globally across our own doors and over time I think we see RFID is a key capability throughout owned and partner retail supply chains. So I think this will help us create the capability to grow profitably across the breadth of the portfolio and ultimately, again it's putting ourselves in position to serve consumers in a way that gets them the product that they need when they want it and where they want it. Andy Campion : And then Omar I will take your question on sneakers. We still see tremendous opportunity with respect to sneakers. I will give you some dimension on where we see that opportunity. In terms of what you referred to as kind of special nature of the product that were launching on sneakers. We still supply a very small percent of the demand that were seeing on sneakers. In fact just this morning, we launched a few pretty unique collaboration and again saw sell out within minutes. That\u2019s fantastic in terms of the heat that some of our styles create, but also an opportunity. Couples of other opportunities within sneakers are apparel. What we done with apparel and in limited cases where we've launched apparel either collaboration or apparel innovation we see an incredible demand and we really have. It's almost overstating it to say we scratched the surface in terms of the heat we can create and connectivity to consumers around apparel.  Women's is another great opportunity through the sneakers app and then two last dimensions I speak to product creation, that's done with the membership data that we get through the sneakers app in mind.  We launched the shoe in this past year. Based on data and analytics relatively Dominican community in New York, which was incredibly well received based on demand and branch. Around that we also see the opportunity, as Mark touched on, to launch innovation directly to members. Sneaker is for people who love the innovation that we provide in the app.  And then finally, what both of us touched on is we often focus on the businesses that we have here in North America because we all experience them as consumers here in North America but we got a tremendous potential to continue to expand the sneakers app globally geographically in markets around the world. Mark Parker : I have to add that the core answer to your question about sustaining the heat in sneakers is going to be the product itself. So the strength of the product, how we refresh it, making sure supply demand is in the right ratio and now the whole experience on sneakers is going to continually evolve I think to make it a very compelling kind of have to check back in day to day comp experience. Nitesh Sharan : Thank you, Omar. Omar Saad : Understood. Thank you. Nitesh Sharan : Operator we will take our next question please. Operator : Your next question is from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is now open. Jim Duffy : Thanks. Hope you're all doing well. I\u2019m interested in the comments on digital and physical intersection and how successful that's been recruiting new customers to the digital ecosystem. Does that make you rethink the role of physical retail in the go to market strategies? And then maybe this will dovetail with my second question. With respect to the key city strategies, are there cities you would highlight as being further along in demonstration of the efficacy of that strategy? Mark Parker : Well, we see the first of all, the intersection of physical and digital is going to continue to be more and more intimate relationship. I think we're looking at a lot of experimentation, trial and error learning from some of the tests that we're doing. Ultimately, it's about making the experience physically or digitally more richer, more dimensionalized experience for consumers. We are saying where we have those digital connections through like NIKE app at retail, we're seeing the engagement from consumers rise significantly. And the actual spend per consumer in those cases actually jumps up dramatically.  So this is something that we don't think it's just a -- it's not just a current trend, this is the future of the fusion of digital and physical is going to continue. And this is a huge priority. It's a source of investment for us. It's ultimately around how do we better serve customers members. And you'll continue to see us evolve that dramatically. And our ambition is to lead in that space. Andy Campion : And then to your question, on key cities, we're seeing over indexing growth in our key cities as compared to the countries in which they are. We're also seeing over indexing results from a brand perspective. Our brand is the number one brand in each of those key cities. I would tell you that in terms of prioritization, which I think was the spirit of your question, our priorities have been in bringing our Consumer Direct Offense to life, first in London, New York, and Shanghai.  So that's where you see us having invested in the new houses of innovation in New York and Shanghai, which do -- that is a bit of a segue from what Mark was just speaking to merging physical and digital in an experience that the consumer really hasn't had for NIKE or anyone else in the marketplace. Those experiences have well exceeded our expectations.  LA is another market where we've started to bring this to life with our smaller format, concept NIKE Live. So I would say that to answer your question, in short, London, New York and Shanghai, I think, are the cities where we're furthest along. But we've got really energized teams in each of the key cities. In fact, we just had all of our key city teams not just jammed together here a couple of weeks ago, at our headquarters to share best practices and learnings and align on how to leverage what we can create globally or in one key city and another key city. So we really think feel great about the progress we're making against that offense. Nitesh Sharan : Thanks, Jim. Operator, we will take our last question, please. Operator : Your last question comes from Sam Poser with Susquehanna. Your line is open. Sam Poser : Thank you for taking my question. I was really wondering, about how you view your brands. As a follow-up on how you view your brand's perceived in China. Somebody said that you were perceived -- other brands were perceived as American or U.S. brands or German brands. But NIKE is perceived as NIKE. Love to get your comment on that. And I have one other question. Andy Campion : Sure, Sam, thanks for the question. I'll start. Yes, as both Mark and I said, our approach has been to be of China for China. And that's not a new approach. That approach is not based on dynamics of late. That's been the approach we've had in for China for two, three decades. And it ranges from the strong leadership team we have in place there with local talent that understands the consumer. Obviously, in our history, it dates back to our sourcing of product in China.  Over the years, it's been about us fueling the passion for sport and participation in sport, not simply being a commercial enterprise in China, but having a bigger view in terms of the purpose and the impact that we could create, in terms of the lively consumers in China.  And then that last point extends to our relationship with the Ministry of Sport and Education. Our partnerships there as well as our partnerships, more probably out in front in terms of the global impact of the teams, athletes and Federation's in China, but why we're invested in sponsoring those teams and athletes and federations is because of their impact on local consumers in China. Sam Poser : Thank you. And then secondly -- Mark Parker : And also as the insights that we're getting for China are actually helping us create China -- products that's more relevant for China but also other parts of the world. So this isn't about importing Western concepts into China as much as it is trying to actually take the insights we gain in China and use it to enrich our global position as a brand and as a product offering. So it's truly not just local for local. It's China putting us in a position to be a better global company. Sam Poser : Thank you. And then just to follow-up on a prior question. The RFID, does this mean with your core partners, Nordstrom and Foot Locker and so on Dick's and so on, that you will be able to overtime, interact with them and maybe interact between your systems to be able to make your inventory act as a whole more efficiently? Mark Parker : Yes. Sorry. Sam, did you add more to that question. Go ahead. Sam Poser : Well, yes, and I'd love color and may add something else. But go from there. Mark Parker : Yes. RFID provides us an opportunity to do what we aspire to do, which is connect the marketplace and do that through our NIKE Direct business, but also through strategic wholesale partners, partners that we view as being part of the NIKE Network of the future. We are already testing the use of RFID in being able to give consumers greater visibility into product down to the style, color and size that they're looking for.  And I'd say that's probably the sharpest and most intuitive aspect of this opportunity is visibility into the inventory for a company like NIKE with the breadth and depth of our portfolio is somewhat limited across our broad distribution within the marketplace, being able to leverage our RFID to give almost 100% visibility into what we have, by style, color and size across our marketplace is an incredible opportunity in terms of meeting consumer demand real time in the moment. Sam Poser : And then lastly, for your speed initiative -- with your speed initiative, how long do you get to double the speed or beyond that this RFID will certainly help that? Andy Campion : Yes. Well, that's one of the measures of success. We feel really good about the progress we're making. On doubling the percentage of products and what we call one half the time to market. We've seen some really strong results over the past year. And we expect that to continue through the next year. And a lot of that effort is led by what we call the Express Lane. And Express Lane as I mentioned, I think, I commented that 20% of our product, sale revenue in EMEA is actually coming from our Express Lane initiative.  So we see the speed initiative for NIKE, the time to market cut in half initiative, really accelerating through this next fiscal year. And it's ultimately going to be a big competitive advantage for us. Mark Parker : Thank you, Sam. And thank you, everybody. Thanks. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Take care. Bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event that you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker. Mark Parker : Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. Many of you know Matt. I'd like to welcome him to his first call as he takes on the responsibility of Investor Relations. And then of course on behalf of the whole team, I\u2019d like to thank Nitesh for his partnership over the last several years. Turning to the results, we feel very good about our performance in the first quarter of fiscal year '20, growing revenue 10% on a currency neutral basis. It was a quarter that proved the depth and balance of our complete offense, building on the strengths of our foundational business drivers and capitalizing on the untapped dimensions of our portfolio. For the quarter, this is reflected in the broad-based growth in all geographies, led by our international business, which grew 16%; in double-digit growth in our women's business off the back of an incredible summer of celebrating female athletes; in both footwear and apparel with our strong lineup of innovation and style which continues to feed the growing consumer demand for comfortable athletic product; and in digital which grew a very strong 42% showing the power of more personal relationships with the consumer. Mobile continues to lead the way and within mobile, app experiences are fueling the most growth. And while this trend has held true in our own channels for some time, we\u2019re beginning to leverage our digital experiences with our retail partners. As we set out to do, we\u2019re creating a differentiated marketplace for NIKE by scaling our learnings and best in class experiences with our partners. The key to expanding our competitive edge continues to be our total commitment to the consumer through the consumer-direct offense. We\u2019re focused. We\u2019re investing in our brand in key markets and we're accelerating in the high growth dimensions of our business. And that\u2019s especially important in the volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical environment that we see today. In relation to tariffs, we've been clear that we strongly believe in the power of free and fair trade. Historically, we've effectively navigated through excessive duties and we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll continue to do so under the current dynamic. In China, specifically, we continue to extend NIKE\u2019s lead. In our key cities of Beijing and Shanghai, we serve a generation of digital-first consumers and we support their love of sport by helping to grow participation through grassroots programs. As I\u2019ve said before, NIKE is a brand of China for China and the results continue to prove it out. We\u2019ve driven double-digit growth in Greater China every quarter for more than five years. This quarter, we continued that momentum with an outstanding 27% revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis. In any environment, NIKE\u2019s foundation for success has always been great product. We continue to see that today with another huge quarter for NIKE innovation. We're delivering more choice and fresh options on some of our hottest products and expansion of both new and existing platforms and a deeper commitment to serving a wider range of athletes. Sportswear continues to lead all categories in both footwear and apparel growing strong double-digits. One of NIKE\u2019s greatest strengths is how we mix style and innovation, and the Air Max React 270 is a perfect example. We\u2019ve created a runway hit by blending Air Max and React with multiple bold colorways. In fact, the 270 Air Max React led to the largest gains in footwear revenue for the quarter. Another strong addition to our lineup this quarter is the Air Max 200, the layered upper with a new visible Air Sole unit continues to build on the energy we\u2019re driving in running silhouettes. We\u2019re also reimagining and clearly segmenting our top sportswear franchises like the Air Force 1 and Tech Fleece. By adapting the Air Force 1 into models like the N.354 and the Sage, we grew the Air Force 1 businesses with women's and kids faster than men\u2019s this quarter. It\u2019s an approach we\u2019re using with our Tech Fleece collection too adding new silhouettes and shapes throughout our lines. Our strategy of designing apparel through themes and collections continues to connect with the consumer, as we drove double-digit growth in sportswear apparel for the 22nd consecutive quarter. Our kids business is one that doesn't get a lot of attention on our calls but it is in fact a critical part of our business. Overall, kids\u2019 footwear and apparel just experienced its biggest back-to-school season ever, driving double-digit growth for the quarter. In kids, we\u2019re earning significant gains through core footwear and apparel for both boys and girls and in basketball and the Air Max 270 which drove triple-digit growth for kids\u2019 power franchises. How we present and distributed kids\u2019 product also provides new opportunities. We see more parents buying on our apps, so we continue to invest in more dynamic imagery on our digital platforms and we\u2019re testing new business models through membership to make it easier for parents to buy at the pace that their kids need new product. In performance product, we saw very strong momentum in basketball internationally this quarter especially with the AlphaDunk. To be honest, we\u2019re excited about the long-term potential of this signature line. Not only did the Zoom Freak 1 become the largest initial signature launch in NIKE basketball history, its apparel line sold out quickly as well with the Freak T-shirt becoming the top selling apparel item on Nike.com. This quarter, we were all inspired by the incredible athletes and performances at the Women's World Cup. It was also a tremendous stage for NIKE innovation. During the all-NIKE final, we also debuted our top football boot innovation, the Mercurial 2019. In addition, apparel revenue from the 2019 Women's World Cup was 4x bigger than it was for the 2015 event. Across the wider business, we stayed intensely focused on the apparel classifications that matter the most to the female athlete; bras and tights. For the quarter, the light-support Indy Bra led the way and our NIKE One Tight is creating incredible demand, especially in NIKE direct and strategic retail partner doors. The NIKE One collection is a great example of our edit to amplify approach that will stretch to other categories putting more focus on our most profitable items across price points and distribution channels. In running, we launched Joyride which was designed to encourage more everyday athletes to get moving. We're excited about the incredible comfort this system delivers with responsive beads that conform to the foot. The customer response to the running silhouette this quarter was very strong and we\u2019re just now beginning to scale the Joyride platform across multiple categories through women\u2019s, sportswear and kids. As we began to communicate through Joyride, one of the biggest opportunity for NIKE is to continue to serve an even wider range of athletes. As leader in our industry, we will add to the growing movement of health and wellness around the world. We\u2019ve been broadening our definition of sport through our brand, but more and more we\u2019re doing it through product innovation. From competition to fitness to light activity to play, our more inclusive view on design is opening up new lanes of opportunity for growth. For example, we\u2019re studying the fit of our products to serve more body types with our successful plus size line. Our teams are designing for modesty to match more people\u2019s preferences and our FLYEASE system has been updated for easier entry and exit to appeal to even more people. We will be expanding into a new high performance basketball shoe and one of the most coveted sneakers of all time, the Air Jordan 1. Making more athletes comfortable and confident can be an incredible catalyst to bringing more people into sport and that\u2019s a theme we\u2019ll continue to champion as we lead into the Tokyo Olympics. On last quarter\u2019s call we told you that the Jordan brand was accelerating and finished with over $3 billion in revenue for fiscal '19. Jordan followed up that record breaking year with the quarter of healthy double-digit growth in all geographies, including mid-teens growth in North America. We're growing at an accelerated pace in new areas like performance basketball, women's, international and apparel and the Air Jordan 1 franchise continues to create incredible demand all over the world. This quarter, we were incredibly excited to announce that Zion joined the Jordan family. We\u2019re proud that Zion will wear the Air Jordan 34 to start this season and we\u2019re already developing new innovation with one of the NBA's most anticipated rookies. Looking over the next few seasons, our pipeline is set to fuel growth in our biggest businesses while also carving out new space for future opportunities. New LeBron and Kyrie signature models will arrive as the NBA season gets started. Women's apparel will lead with new materials of performance types. Training will introduce a new franchise designed for a range of fitness activities, including high-intensity workouts, station-based training and spinning classes. Running will introduce more innovation that\u2019s proven to help make athletes faster as we headed into Tokyo. And our adaptive platform will continue to evolve with new features like voice activation from your phone. There\u2019s much more to come from NIKE innovation in fiscal year '20. While products are usually the first to grab the attention of our consumers, we deepened those relationships through the power of digital. To do that, we\u2019re investing in three areas. We're building industry leading personal experiences. We're quickly ramping up our backend capabilities to capture more of that demand. And the final critical piece is to create scale through our own channels and with our partners. Membership sits at the heart of that strategy giving consumers a more personal relationship with NIKE. Fundamentally, that gives them easier access to more tailored products and services. With product, there are multiple advantages to being a logged in member. In some cases, it means they have early access to our latest innovation like we did this quarter with the launch of Joyride and the Air Max 270 React. It can also be as simple as giving better access to the product they want in the moment, so you\u2019re capturing more full-price demand. Connected inventory is critical to that capability. With services, we\u2019re bringing real value to our members\u2019 lives consistently. Our teams are assessing different ways to engage with more people completely and have them coming back for more. Over the last three years, we more than doubled the number of active users across all of our apps. With more active engagement we create more value for both our members and for NIKE. In this quarter, for example, over 50% of our NIKE direct digital growth came from numbers. Becoming personal at scale is the ultimate objective. We start in our own channels and then amplify those experiences through partnerships. The sneakers app has truly redefined our connection with the sneaker community. It\u2019s now in 22 countries with more room to grow in EMEA and APLA and grew roughly 50% this quarter. We've also begun to test a new opportunity within sneakers on high heat apparel. The early read from our members on our pilots has been very positive. As I\u2019ve said before, the NIKE app is the most comprehensive one-stop shop for NIKE. It\u2019s become the largest and fastest-growing platform in our portfolio, growing almost triple digits this quarter. The NIKE app is already in 21 countries and will go live in China in holiday. Just as exciting is the impact that the NIKE app is having on the physical shopping experience. It\u2019s scaling in North America and features can be now activated in every store owned NIKE location, most factory stores including most factory stores and in this quarter alone we added nearly 1 million new NIKE members from interactions in our North America doors. NIKE Fit is our technology that scans the foot, eliminating a significant consumer friction point by providing an accurate read of a users shoe size. The in-store experience is currently available in all North America locations and is moving quickly into Europe and Japan. We\u2019ll also be launching an at-home in app experience later this fiscal year. We\u2019re moving at an impressive pace in the channels that we control and while we continue to invest in stronger more distinctive partnerships. When coming together with another platform or retailer, our objective is to create a better experience in the path of the consumer. We want them to be able to move seamlessly from online to offline and easily find the product they want, when they want it across the marketplace. Ultimately by recognizing, serving and rewarding members, it will engage with NIKE more often across multiple channels and touch points. Our teams continue to be very active in this space. NIKE App at Retail is already showing the ability to scale with partners. This quarter, for the first time, NIKE App at Retail features and NIKE membership were activated with a wholesaler through a pilot with Foot Locker\u2019s Washington Heights store. We plan to integrate NIKE App at Retail in more Foot Locker doors in North America and bring new experiences to Zalando in Europe and top sports in China later this fiscal year. Our inventory partnership program also continued to scale, including Zalando, JD and Pro-Direct in Europe. And we're leveraging the world's top social media platforms with Instagram where consumers can use direct messaging for commerce in our women's and training channels and with WeChat with a new feature that allows users to check product availability in nearby stores instantly. A critical component to accelerating all of our opportunities is our ability to become smarter through our supply chain. And to do that we\u2019re bringing science to the art of retail like never before. With Zodiac, we've acquired proprietary technology and teams to better know our members, give them better experiences and expand their lifetime value to the NIKE brand. Invertex brought us computer visioning capabilities for NIKE Fit which we talked about and in addition to more accurate fitting sizes we\u2019re already using the insights we gain to inform better design product. And just last month we acquired a new predictive analytics platform and team of data scientists through our acquisition of Celect. This game will greatly accelerate our ability to turn raw data into actionable demand insights, and this allows us to make more accurate inventory decisions closer to market. We\u2019re partnering, investing in our own teams and we\u2019re gaining new capabilities all in the name of serving the consumer more completely. It was a great start to the year for NIKE. The global shift towards more active lifestyles continues to accelerate and demand for athletic product is high. As a company, we have a sharper focus on these areas that will drive the greatest growth. We\u2019re bringing the joy of sport to even more people and we continue to build our more valuable relationships with the consumer through the power of digital. Our fundamentals are strong, but what excites me the most is the significant opportunity ahead for our industry and for NIKE. Thanks. And now here\u2019s Andy. Andy Campion : Thank you, Mark, and hello to everyone on the call. First, I want to take a moment to personally thank Nitesh for his incredibly valuable partnership and leadership over Investor Relations as he now transitions into a new and expanded set of responsibilities. And I also want to welcome Matt to his first call as he expands his responsibilities to include leadership over Investor Relations. In Q1, we came out of the block strong with our results meeting or exceeding the expectations we set 90 days ago on every dimension. Most notably, we delivered currency neutral revenue growth of 10%, 150 basis point of gross margin expansion, EPS growth of 28% and high expanding returns on invested capital. Those are extraordinary numbers, but what we're most excited about is the quality of our performance. Our financial performance in Q1 reflects exceptional strategic execution by our teams around the world. We continue on our relentless drive to transform how NIKE serves consumers. There are three key themes that really stand out when we reflect on Q1. One, the strategic transformation of NIKE continues to be the fuel for accelerating broad-based growth across our global portfolio. Two, this transformational growth is not happening by accident. Our targeted investments are extending our competitive advantage. And three, while the geopolitical and macro environment is increasingly volatile and in some respects unpredictable, consumer sentiment for the NIKE brand remains incredibly strong and consistent around the world. Let\u2019s go a bit deeper on these three themes. First, strategic transformation is driving our broad-based global growth. When it comes to creating value for shareholders it all starts with growth. And as Mark has said, when it comes to grow, at NIKE it all starts with product. NIKE is bringing innovative new product to market at an unrivaled pace and scale. New innovation platforms equated to over 100% of our incremental growth in Q1. That includes the successful launch of Joyride and strong sustained consumer demand for recently launched platforms from React to the range of compelling new Air Max platforms launched over the past two years such as VaporMax, 270, 720 and 200. At the same time digital is transforming and amplifying everything we do at NIKE. In Q1, NIKE digital grew 42% on a currency neutral basis driven by enhanced digital services and the expansion of our ecosystem internationally. The NIKE app and sneakers app are now both live in over 20 countries with more expansion coming over the balance of fiscal year '20. As for the second key theme, we are making deliberate investments both organically and through acquisitions to extend NIKE\u2019s competitive advantage. For example, we've enhanced our ability to test and scale new digital services faster by investing in the migration of over 95% of our consumer experiences to a more nimble cloud-based architectural. Our acquisition of Celect in Q1 was another accelerator of our transformation. Celect\u2019s team and proprietary digital demand sensing tools will help us more effectively predict demand, plan supply, allocate product to the right stores and sharpen our pricing and markdown gains. Celect\u2019s capabilities are first of their kind in our industry. Most other industries sell the same products season after season. Celect has developed unique models the leverage data science and machine learning in our industry where we bring new and innovative product to market every season. The acquisition of Celect accelerates our building of digital demand sensing capabilities by at least three years. With NIKE's unrivaled scale and resources, we will continue to capitalize on opportunities such as these to invest and extend our leadership and competitive advantage. At the same time, we\u2019re also increasingly offsetting our incremental investment through the editing of resources within our legacy operating models. The third key theme as we reflect on Q1 relates to the environment in which we\u2019re operating. Despite increasingly dynamic and somewhat unpredictable macro and geopolitical factors, consumer sentiment and affinity for the NIKE brand remained strong and consistent. NIKE\u2019s growth continues to outpace GDP growth and broader retail growth in our major markets around the world, and NIKE continues to be the number one favorite brand in our 12 key global cities. Since launching our consumer direct offense two years ago, our currency neutral performance has exceeded our long-term financial model in terms of growth, profitability and return on invested capital and we see that momentum continuing over the balance of fiscal year '20. While the macro dynamics are even more volatile than they were 90 days ago, NIKE has a long track record of remaining agile and managing all of the levers we control. We are also increasingly engaging with all of our constituents on the levers that are outside of our direct control. As a result, to-date our net real dollar reported results have remained strong and consistent. We continue to deliver strong financial performance despite FX having had a roughly $3 billion negative impact on our reported revenue and over $1.5 billion of negative impact on our EBIT over the past four years. Despite the recently implemented tariffs and associated FX headwinds, we expect to continue delivering strong financial performance going forward. But before sharing our positive outlook for the balance of fiscal year '20, I\u2019ll first touch on our reported Q1 results in a bit more detail. NIKE, Inc. Q1 revenue increased 10% on a currency neutral basis and 7% on a reported basis. Our stronger than projected overall growth reflects healthy balanced growth across all four of our geographies, led by NIKE digital globally in Greater China. Gross margin expanded by 150 basis points in Q1 as average gross selling prices expanded and higher margin NIKE direct growth outpaced wholesale growth. Q1 gross margin significantly exceeded our guidance, driven primarily by a shift in the timing of supply chain and other investments out of Q1 and into the balance of the year, significantly lower than planned markdown rates in our NIKE factory stores; in fact even lower than we\u2019d expect in a typical quarter and the favorable mix impact from stronger than planned growth in our high-margin international geographies and NIKE direct. We nonetheless expect gross margin expansion over the balance of the fiscal year, though of course not at the same level as we saw in Q1. I\u2019ll touch on this more specifically in our guidance. SG&A grew 9% in Q1 as we continue to invest in our digital transformation and in part driven by brand marketing associated with the Women's World Cup and the Joyride innovation launch. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 12.4% which would have been largely in line with guidance but for favorable non-recurring items. First quarter diluted earnings per share increased 28% to $0.86. And as of August 31st, inventories were up 12% reflecting strong forward-looking consumer demand globally and also in support of key consumer moments such as back-to-school which has extended into September this year and looking ahead to Singles\u2019 Day on 11.11 in Greater China. Now let\u2019s turn to the financial performance for our reported operating segments. In North America, Q1 revenue grew 4%. Our growth in Q1 was right on plan, led by digital from a channel perspective and sportswear in Jordan categorically. We are reshaping the marketplace in North America with NIKE digital growing over 30% on a currency neutral basis and with high single-digit growth across our key strategic and differentiated partners. In Q1, we also drove an intentional decline in undifferentiated multi-brand wholesale. We continue to reallocate our best product and our retail investment dollars to NIKE direct and differentiated partner experiences. That includes, for example, testing new services, leveraging the NIKE app in partner doors such as in Washington Heights with Foot Locker. Now let\u2019s turn to EMEA where revenue grew 12% on a currency neutral basis in Q1. Growth was broad based across our categories and amplified by strong double-digit growth in NIKE digital. We see continued strong digital momentum in Europe with the Nike app having just launched in 13 new countries across this geography. We extended our lead in Europe in Q1 with the NIKE brand rated the number one favorite brand in all of our key cities and our business growing at strong double-digit rates in London, Berlin and Milan. While NIKE direct is a key driver, our strategic partnerships with JD and Zalando are also contributing to our strong sustained growth in Europe. Now let\u2019s turn to Greater China, which continues to set the pace for NIKE's growth globally. Q1 marks the 21st consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in Greater China. In Q1, Greater China grew 27% on a currency neutral basis fueled by nearly all key categories led by sportswear and Jordan. Coming off of the FIBA World Cup in China, we are also excited about the energy around the basketball category in this geography and globally as we enter the new NBA season. The impact of digital in China has been nothing short of extraordinary. NIKE digital grew over 70% in Q1, in part amplified by our strategic partnerships with Tmall and WeChat. And looking ahead we are pulling forward the launch of the NIKE app in Greater China into late Q2. Based on trade and other dynamics we continue to be deeply engaged with all of our constituents in China and we\u2019re also closely monitoring consumer sentiment. At the same time, affinity for the NIKE brand continues to build and our sell-through at retail remains very strong. We believe we're extending the NIKE brand\u2019s leadership in China by remaining authentically focused on serving the Chinese consumer while fueling their passion for sport and a broader movement toward a more active lifestyle. So now let's turn from China to another fast-growing geography, APLA. In Q1, APLA revenue grew 13% on a currency neutral basis driven by nearly 50% growth in NIKE digital. In Q1, we launched the NIKE App at Retail in our [indiscernible] store, a great example of bringing the consumer direct offense to life globally through the key city of Tokyo. The culture of basketball was also driving force behind the momentum we saw in APLA with the Jordan brand growing strong double digits year-over-year. APLA is an extremely entrepreneurial and diverse geography. In APLA we continue testing new concepts with local partners such as our digital commerce relationship with Flipkart in India to leveraging the social media platform Kakao in Korea on the launch of Joyride and on ramping new members. Finally, at Converse, revenue increased 8% on a currency neutral basis with the Converse brand delivering strong double-digit growth in China and across digital globally, while returning to growth in Europe. Growth is being fueled by an increasingly stronger and diversified product portfolio, including across the Chuck Taylor franchise, the Chuck 70 and the Chuck Taylor Lift. We're also excited about Converse\u2019s reentry into performance basketball, which got off to a great start with the successful launch of the All Star Pro BB. Now turning to our outlook. We see continued momentum going forward. Accordingly, our projected currency neutral growth and profitability are improving. One might have expected the recently implemented tariffs and associated FX headwinds to result in lower real dollar expectations; however, our real dollar outlook remains consistent to slightly improved net of all of the dynamics in our business. For the full year we continue to expect reported revenue growth within the high single-digit range, slightly exceeding fiscal year '19 reported revenue growth. This incorporates our improved currency neutral outlook being largely offset by the more intense FX headwinds of late associated with trade dynamics. Recall that the impact of foreign exchange hedges is not accounted for within our revenue line item. We now expect to deliver full year gross margin expansion within the 50 to 75 basis point range. That assumes that the negative impact of recently implemented tariffs remains in effect for the balance of our fiscal year. And again remember that our Q1 gross margin expansion was amplified by timing shifts and other discrete items. While our recent acquisition of Celect will have some impact on SG&A, we still expect SG&A to grow roughly in line with revenue for the year. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens. And for OIE, net of interest expense, we continue to expect $50 million to $100 million of income for the year. Our focus first and foremost is on sustaining strong currency neutral operating momentum over the full year and longer term, but based on the volatile dynamics of late I'll provide a bit of context on Q2. We expect reported revenue growth in Q2 to be in line with our Q1 reported revenue growth. That assumes our strong currency neutral revenue growth will be dampened by roughly 3 points of FX headwinds.  For gross margin, we expect Q2 expansion to be roughly 25 basis points with slightly greater expansion than that in the second half of the year. The impact of tariffs will be most pronounced in Q2. In Q2, we expect SG&A growth in the high single-digit range. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens range. And for OIE, we expect income in Q2 to be roughly $10 million to $30 million. We are extremely pleased with our brand momentum and the strong currency neutral growth we delivered since implementing our new offense two years ago. That said, we are still in the early stages of NIKE strategic transformation. Our execution of the consumer direct offense will continue to fuel growth across our portfolio of key categories, key cities in key countries as well as accelerate our growth against the outside long-term opportunities that we see in women's, apparel, digital and international. With that, we\u2019ll now open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Your line is open. Bob Drbul : Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Mark Parker : Hi, Bob. Andy Campion : Hi, Bob. Bob Drbul : I guess the question I have is \u2013 two questions really. On the first part of it is in North America, can you talk a little bit more about the apparel performance in terms of some success in women\u2019s but just generally the level of growth and sort of how we should approach that? And the second question is just around the inventory levels, any pockets of concerns there, any areas geographically that you\u2019re concerned about or anything we should think about from that perspective? Mark Parker : Sure. I\u2019ll start on North America apparel. We continue \u2013 you asked about women\u2019s in particular, we continue to grow the women\u2019s apparel business in North America. It\u2019s in fact growing at a very strong rate. At the same time we see great opportunity ahead, even greater than we\u2019ve capitalized on to date. Overall, in terms of apparel growth, we\u2019re really pleased with the growth. The number in Q1 does compare unfavorably to some prior year comps. As you may recall last year in Q1, apparel in North America grew 8% and that was in part impacted by the jersey business relative to the NBA. As you may recall, LeBron changed teams last year and that had some impact. We also were seeing this year back-to-school extend a bit out of Q1 and into our Q2. So in short we see really strong demand for our apparel in North America. We\u2019ve had a little bit of pressure on supply but you\u2019re going to see the rates of growth in North America apparel accelerate over the balance of the year. And then you asked about inventory. I guess I\u2019ll take that one too. Inventory as we spoke about was up 12% versus prior year. That was primarily driven by strong consumer demand. A majority of our inventories in new seasonal product, some of which is in transit to the marketplace and we\u2019ll sell in to the marketplace and sell through over the quarter and into Q3. There was also a little bit of an impact from foreign exchange in that inventory number. So if you look at it on a unit basis, our unit inventory growth is really well aligned with our forward-looking unit growth. And kind of combining those two themes, one, the fact that it\u2019s largely seasonal inventory and, two, that the overall unit numbers are aligned with what you\u2019re seeing and you would expect and hope to see is that our closeout mix is low and it is in fact very low. So our inventory is very healthy in our geographies. There are a couple of other dynamics that are probably worth calling out. One, again, is this extended back-to-school season. So you see some of that inventory now selling through as back-to-school extended into September, which is in our Q2. And then we also have been building inventory in anticipation of Singles\u2019 Day on 11.11 in China. So the punch line is we feel great about the inventory that we have on hand and it\u2019s reflective of the strong demand for the brand. Bob Drbul : Great. Mark Parker : Thank you. Operator, next question. Operator : Our next question is from Jamie Merriman with Bernstein. Your line is open. Jamie Merriman : Thanks very much for all the color on the call. The first question is with respect to North America and you talked about the decision to purposely ramp down some of those \u2013 not strategic partners in the market. Can you talk about how those plans play out for the balance of 2020 and how we should think about that? And then can you just give us an update on how you\u2019re thinking about some of those strategic partners, specifically with e-commerce on whether you have an update on partnerships with Amazon, Jet, partners like that and what you\u2019ve seen so far? Thank you. Mark Parker : Hi, Jamie. I\u2019ll take the first question relative to North America. As you may recall from our call 90 days ago, we highlighted that we were going to have some year-over-year comparison dynamics in North America. So I\u2019d start by saying we\u2019re right on plan in North America. We\u2019re really pleased with the growth that we\u2019re seeing in that geography. We still see that geography as sustaining strong healthy mid-single digit growth. You\u2019ll see slightly higher growth rates in North America over the balance of the year than what we delivered in Q1 and of course remember not all percents are created equal. A point or two of growth in North America is a pretty significant impact. And then again I think I touched on this a little bit with respect to Bob\u2019s question. The growth in Q1 was slightly impacted again by some year-over-year comparisons not just in the jersey business but also the timing of innovation launches in footwear and then again with that kind of extended back-to-school season spanning over Q1 and into our Q2, which begins in September. So again, we see tremendous momentum in North America. You also asked about the distinction between NIKE direct differentiated consumer experiences and undifferentiated consumer experiences. That is really a tale of two cities. We are seeing strong in fact accelerating growth in NIKE digital. We\u2019re seeing high-single digit growth in differentiated retail with our strategic partners. And we\u2019re seeing an expected in fact somewhat intentional and deliberate decline in undifferentiated retail and the drivers of that are how we allocate product and where we put our retail investment dollars. So we would expect that trend to continue in the short term. Of course, long term our goal is we have reshaped this marketplace to one in which we\u2019re connecting much more directly with NIKE consumers and members through NIKE direct in our strategic wholesale partners. So again, we\u2019re on plan in North America. The brand\u2019s extremely strong and really excited about the opportunities ahead including in those areas we consistently touched on; digital, women\u2019s, core footwear below $100 which is touched on in apparel. Andy Campion : Let me touch on the second question you had on the digital partnerships. Obviously, digital growth is driving much of NIKE\u2019s overall growth and that\u2019s importantly obviously for direct but also the digital base business with our partners both wholesalers who are expanding their growth through the digital channel as well as digital platforms. We don\u2019t have anything new to update you on in terms of Amazon. So far the work with Amazon, the relationship has gone well. The business is performing well that is, so nothing new to report there. We continue to sort of analyze that relationship and the other opportunities we have from a platform partnership standpoint. It\u2019s really critical that our platform partners are actually serving our members or serving our consumers at the highest level possible so that means sort of seamless interaction, frictionless experiences in terms of commerce, looking at an environment where they know that they\u2019re buying authentic NIKE products and ultimately just to better know and serve our consumers. So those are things that we expect from our digital platform partners. We feel really good about our partners in Europe and in China and then also growing through the digital channels here in the United States with partners like Instagram through social media, just getting on Jet so there\u2019s lots of opportunity ahead there. So this will be an important part of our growth going forward. And I should mention \u2013 I failed to mention one of our biggest most successful partners here is in China and that\u2019s Tmall. So tremendous relationship there, continues to add energy to the brand as well as help to drive our business in China. Mark Parker : Okay. Operator, next question. Operator : Your next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Paul Trussell : Congrats on a great quarter. Thanks for taking our question. I wanted to touch base on the gross margin performance. Perhaps you could just walk through a little bit more detail on the spread versus your original estimates, how we should think about the supply chain impact in 1Q and how that will affect the balance of the quarters as well as what were the drivers behind the lower than expected markdowns and what is the impact in 2Q of tariffs, color on that would be helpful? Thank you. Mark Parker : Sure. Thanks, Paul. I will first walk you through some of the impacts or drivers as you said in terms of the spread versus our guidance. So as compared to the expectations we said 90 days ago, 150 basis points significantly exceeded those. I\u2019d say, first, I would touch on higher growth and favorable mix in our international geographies; second, higher growth in our NIKE direct business and again both of those are I would say over-indexing growth versus the plan we had 90 days ago, so strong momentum in those dimensions of our business versus plan. And again, our international geographies are higher margin geographies than North America and our NIKE direct business is a higher margin business than the wholesale business. You asked about lower than expected markdowns in our factory store business, I\u2019d say that was most pronounced in Europe. In Europe, we\u2019ve really just had extraordinary separation. You\u2019ve seen strong double-digit currency neutral growth in Europe for quite some time. We\u2019re taking share and our brand\u2019s just incredibly strong in all of our key cities in Europe. So frankly our markdowns were much lower than we had planned there and in some other areas of our business. Not only we planned for the quarter but then you\u2019d expect in a typical quarter. You also asked about the impact of tariffs. Tariffs will impact Q2 through Q4. Now again, we guided to slightly improved overall gross margin even taking into account those tariffs, but the impact is more pronounced in Q2. As you know they were announced in August and implemented on September 1. That doesn\u2019t give us much time to manage any of the levers within our overall portfolio. As we look out to the balance of the year, there are a lot of levers within our portfolio. We\u2019ve managed them over time. We\u2019re a big proponent of free and fair trade and that\u2019s because tariffs have always been part of the financial equation in NIKE, so with a little bit of time we have a lot of levers we can work with from sourcing to other levers. So the impact of tariffs is most significant in Q2. And then as you likely inferred from our guidance, we expect slightly greater gross margin expansion in Q3 and Q4 as compared to Q2. Paul Trussell : I really appreciate that color. My quick follow up is just regarding the product pipeline. You spoke about a lot of the exciting platforms that are delivering results for you already. Just curious if there\u2019s a way that you could maybe rank for us your excitement or how you think about the platforms and new areas of innovation that will drive these strong high-single digit revenue gains over the balance of the year as we think about Joyride and Air Max now moving to 200, what you\u2019re doing in women\u2019s, just any color on that would be helpful? Thank you. Mark Parker : Yes, absolutely. The excitement meter is very high over this next year. We sort of look at the Summer Olympics as term papers due and so we\u2019re \u2013 this is the time when we bring our best work not only from a brand standpoint but certainly from a product standpoint. And in this case both performance-based innovation that actually leverages into sport style or sportswear, so we feel like the portfolio of innovation or the pipeline of innovation is more complete. I always talk about the complete offense and that\u2019s how we line up innovation is against our complete offense. You mentioned women\u2019s. I would include core in that, more accessibly priced innovation coming particularly in the spring/summer seasons. We\u2019ve got incredible again sportswear. We\u2019ve good performance up in here for a long time at NIKE and some of the most incredible breakthroughs in performance coming for the Tokyo Olympics building on some of the great platforms that we\u2019ve learned how to leverage more completely. That includes the cadence of the innovations, how we manage the lifecycle of innovations and how we again leverage that across multiple categories both in performance and sportswear. So incredibly high level of excitement. I would add we\u2019ve talked about adapt. It\u2019s still in the early stages. NIKE Fit will include both the powered adaptive systems as well as non-powered hands free systems and that\u2019s incredibly exciting as we bring innovation to more \u2013 make innovation more accessible to more people. Women\u2019s of course will continue to be a high priority. We\u2019re shifting resources to amp up our innovation agenda there, feel really good both footwear and apparel. Kids I mentioned is an incredible category to leverage the innovation that we have more completely across the portfolio, so that\u2019s a major source for us for growth as well. So I think the opportunities ahead are as bright as I\u2019ve ever seen them, so very bullish. Paul Trussell : Sounds like -- Mark Parker : Okay. Operator? Operator : Our next question is from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Omar Saad : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on another great quarter. I wanted to ask my first question, another follow up on North America. The 30% DTC growth obviously that\u2019s a huge number, a smaller piece of the business. We talked about that still kind of being offset by the intentional reduction and undifferentiated of the wholesale. If we think about when DTC \u2013 kind of the time horizon looking out when the DTC just to become a material mover for the overall North American market or you get to a point where you\u2019re happy with kind of the wholesale footprint. And then I have another follow up for Mark as well. Thanks. Andy Campion : Yes, Omar, we at our Investor Day a couple of years ago talked about our business being 30% or greater digital, owned and partnered over the next five years. That\u2019s a global measure of success, but I would say North America is in that same range in terms of the [indiscernible]. So we see digital alone not necessarily all of NIKE direct, but digital alone being in that range. And as we\u2019ve discussed we see that continuing to build beyond that and potentially accelerating towards that date based on the incredible momentum that we\u2019ve had. As I noted, that was an accelerated level of growth in NIKE digital in Q1. So much like we discussed at our Investor Day two years ago, our view is that over the next five years, sustainable profitable growth in North America would equate to a mid-single digit range of growth. But what we\u2019re really excited about is we think the next five years in North America is building the platform for the long term future. North America is the marketplace where the most reshaping and transformation is required and frankly is underway. Omar Saad : Got it. And then stepping back, I don\u2019t think and watching the different components of the company perform year-after-year or quarter-after-quarter, I\u2019ve never seen such consistent positive performance across categories, regions, price points, channels, age groups, genders. Maybe help us understand \u2013 NIKE obviously performed exceptionally in the past, but maybe if you can help us understand or give us some insight into why that kind of broader platform seems to be performing so much more consistently than it has historically? Thanks. Mark Parker : I think we\u2019re actually a lot smarter about how we \u2013 not only where we invest in terms of new product innovation but as I said we better leverage that innovation across multiple categories and then up and down the price point spectrum across genders. Again, I was fixated on complete offense and it\u2019s one of those areas where you go no matter how well we\u2019re doing across all those dimensions, we see more opportunity areas where we have \u2013 we are underpenetrated where we have what we call outsized opportunities. We\u2019ve talked about apparel. We\u2019ve talked about women\u2019s, digital, international as examples. But even in our foundational business I think we\u2019ve got tremendous upside ahead in terms of core. Striking that right balance across the complete portfolio or the complete offense as we call it is never ending challenge for us or opportunity, let me put it that way. So the innovation that we\u2019re putting out there I think we\u2019re just getting better at how we\u2019re leveraging that across the entire offense. And I feel like this has always been a competitive advantage for NIKE as the source of brand energy but also tremendous growth for us and I\u2019ve never seen or been at NIKE during a period where there\u2019s such robust and strong innovation that\u2019s relevant to consumers across the portfolio. That said, I\u2019d be the first one as people here at NIKE would tell you to say that we have a lot more opportunity. So the challenge or the opportunity is to focus on the things that matter the most. We have unlimited opportunities. The fixation or the focus on the things that are really going to drive the needle from a consumer standpoint that are really going to be relevant and ultimately drive growth is what creates success. Andy Campion : And Omar I\u2019d just add maybe from a framework perspective or framing of how you might think about it, our key categories in our 12 key cities and our 10 key countries are really the where in terms of growth opportunity is for NIKE. The consumer direct offense is the how and it applies to all of those categories, all those cities and all those countries and that\u2019s about doubling the cadence and impact of innovation, being faster to market so that\u2019s 2x speed and then being more directly connected to consumers. And there isn\u2019t any dimension of our offense, the complete offense that Mark refers to, that isn\u2019t [indiscernible] can be positively impacted by those strategic principles. And then of course the overarching or maybe you\u2019d say underlying fuel is this digital transformation of NIKE, it\u2019s impacting everything we do from how we create product to how we assess demand and plan supply all the way through to consumer services through the NIKE app that are now not just in our digital offerings but in our retail stores and increasingly in our partner doors. So it\u2019s really a strategy the consumer racked off in the sense of that, impacting every dimension of the portfolio. Mark Parker : Yes, I want to put an exclamation point on that. The digital capabilities that we\u2019re creating and investing in are really going to make us a better innovation company understanding the consumer, serving the consumer, leveraging the innovation that we invest in, it\u2019s all making us better. I see so much more opportunity from advancing our digital capabilities going forward. Okay. Operator, maybe we have time for one more call. Operator : Our last question is from Jim Duffy with Stifel Nicolaus & Co. Your line is open. Jim Duffy : Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. A couple of questions from me on the gross margin. Andy, as we think about gross margin in the context of historical performance, you\u2019ve got pricing power afforded by innovations, structural shifts from outgrowth of direct, you\u2019re reshaping the North American marketplace and then some more nuance factors that can help margin like leveraging Celect and NIKE Fit and so forth. Is there a reason to think that NIKE gross margin shouldn\u2019t go past peaks in the near future? It seems like a lot of good things are coming together. Andy Campion : The short answer is no. I think many of the drivers you mentioned and some others are long-term drivers of expansion in margin. NIKE direct is a significantly higher margin business than the wholesale business and as we just touched on as part of Omar\u2019s question, we see digital and direct being increasingly larger part of our business long term. The price value equation is also an opportunity to expand margin. And as Mark just touched on, we\u2019ve never been more excited about the innovation pipeline we\u2019re bringing to market and that means bringing tangible value to the consumer. In your own question you touched on a huge opportunity. At our Investor Day we talked about the potentially significant impact from having a greater mix of full-price sell through and lower markdowns and closeout, and Celect is just spot on in terms of the capabilities that we had planned to build organically but are now able to start leveraging, thanks to this acquisition and drive that. If I was to tell you the one thing that we\u2019re not as pleased about are the FX headwinds that have impacted us. As I touched on, on the call over the last four years we\u2019ve had about $3 billion headwind on revenue and $1.5 billion more headwind on profitability. Of course, if we could add this back we would. That would be a pretty significant expansion in our operating margin that\u2019s more reflective of what we\u2019re doing from an operating perspective. But again, the short answer is yes. We see some pretty systemic drivers of gross margin expansion over the short, medium and long term. Jim Duffy : And then as it relates to FX and gross margin, to what extent are more favorable hedge rates a positive contributor to gross margin in the first quarter and fiscal '20? Andy Campion : Yes, the way I would think about FX in fiscal year '20 is we came into the year expecting FX to be sort of neutral to slightly favorable. It\u2019s now a net negative from an EBIT perspective. Again that\u2019s in the context of our slightly improved guidance, so we are thrilled that our operational performance just continues to be so strong that it\u2019s offsetting that. Over the balance of the year one thing to keep in mind is it\u2019s somewhat difficult to predict \u2013 not to predict but to model the impact of FX. You have very volatile actual spot rates. Certainly the Renminbi is at the top of the list in that regard of late. The timing of our hedges over the course of the year as well as the timing which is kind of backward looking timing aspect in terms of when we lock in product costs. So I think that the easiest way for me to say it is, FX will be about 3 points negative headwind on revenue as I spoke about in my guidance. It will be a slightly negative impact on margin over the course of the full fiscal year and it\u2019s now shifted to a slightly negative impact from an EBIT perspective. Mark Parker : We\u2019re hopeful that those are more transient impacts. And that as we go forward and we get more certainty with respect to trade and some resolution that maybe we see things turn from a headwind into a tailwind. Okay. Thank you, Jim, and thank you everybody. Thank you for joining us on the call today and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Take care. Bye-bye. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.",

In the event you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue, and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker. Mark Parker : Thanks, Matt, and hello everybody. As most of you know, this is my final quarterly earnings call as NIKE's CEO. And while I'm tempted to go right to the results to let another strong quarter speak for itself, there are a few things I want to say right upfront. I'm excited to take on a new role as Executive Chairman, remaining a part of the management team and leading the Board. This has been a very thoughtful transition that has been planned for many months. I strongly believe the best time to make change is from a position of strength. And our brand and our business are as strong as they\u2019ve ever been. We're focused, we're competitive, and we\u2019re creating a future of our own design. Most of all, the time is right because of the team we have at NIKE, and of course, John Donahoe himself. I can't say enough about the incredible people I get to work with every single day. With their expertise, their commitment and their enthusiasm for the business, the entire NIKE team has been fueling our current momentum. And because of the depth and the quality of the leadership team we have at NIKE, the transition with John will be seamless. As for John, his proven experience in leading global strategy, digital commerce and enterprise technology will be invaluable as we continue our digital transformation. And his passion for sport, his commitment to developing teams and talent, and his growth mindset will make him a great NIKE CEO. John will help elevate NIKE to the next level and accelerate our strategic transformation. I look forward to working with him even more closely. With that let's take a look at our Q2 results where we continue to show the greater focus is the key to accelerating growth. Overall revenue for the quarter grew 10%, up 13% on a currency-neutral basis. The big takeaways from the last 90 days are proving that innovation is NIKE's greatest competitive advantage. The consumer is voting for our brands across the whole portfolio and up and down price points. The passion for sport and active lifestyles is thriving around the world. Our international business grew 18%, led by Greater China at 23% and we continue to grow NIKE\u2019s digital advantage in the marketplace. The Nike app and the SNKRS app are outperforming all other channels, driving digital growth of 38% for Q2. I\u2019ll get into the details by sharing some of our Q2 product wins and insights, and to how our session on product and innovation is creating separation for NIKE. Starting with Sportswear, we're opening new lanes of opportunity by reimagining our top products. One example is how we're bringing fresh points of view to some of our most loved iconic footwear with the Air Force 1, the Air Jordan 1 and our deep line up of Air Max. Our deliberate strategy is to add new styles and colors to the Air Jordan 1, which allows us to bring one of the world's most popular sneakers to more people while offering consumers more choice. And with women and the Air Force One, we're running a nimble key city offense through the Express Lane using local feedback to create and move product to meet shifting consumer tastes. We\u2019ll apply that process to a new classic strategy for women that will ramp up in the back half of the fiscal year. 2X Innovation is creating a continuous cycle of scalable distinct platforms. For example, in this quarter, the top three growth drivers in Air Max were all introduced in the last year with the Air Max 270, 720 and the 200. In basketball footwear, we're leveraging signature athletes to create innovation that matches different styles of play and creates real differentiation across price points. It starts with new expressions of platforms like Zoom Air, among articulated cushioning unit in Kyrie 6 for quick-cutting to a higher stack height for more response in jumping with the new AlphaDunk. With the LeBron 17, we created a new cushioning system to propel the game's most explosive player during his incredible run with the Lakers this season. We're seeing very strong sell-through in our signature athletes\u2019 footwear, especially through digital and in China. Next quarter gives us a number of storytelling opportunities to create even more energy with Chinese New Year, the first NBA regular season game in Paris and the NBA All-Star game in Chicago. Running continues to create tremendous energy with consumers across both performance and lifestyle. At NIKE, we leverage innovation to help athletes perform better while catalyzing energy and growth in running inspired sportswear styles. That starts with serving the widest range of runners. And over the past two years, we've introduced several performance innovation platforms into the running category, including React, Vaporfly 4%, NEXT% and Joyride. Vaporfly 4% and NEXT% continue to transform the sport, taking over the fields and marathons around the world, including this quarter\u2019s sub-two-hour marathon from Eliud Kipchoge in Vienna and Brigid Kosgei\u2019s women\u2019s marathon world record in Chicago. While Joyride and React continue to fuel the everyday runner, early next year, we will keep the cadence of new platforms going. In January, we'll start with a Nike React Infinity Run, which blends responsiveness and comfort for both efficiency and impact reduction. And for Tokyo 2020, we\u2019ll introduce a new Zoom Air running platform that will scale across both performance and lifestyle. A more complete running offense also means delivering greater value at core price points and a number of initiatives are developing, such as our exciting Renew platform offering a plush resilient ride, similar to the properties of React Cushioning. We're selectively leveraging one of the NIKE's most iconic innovations Air Max into core price points. And we're designing women's core products from the ground up, bringing both unique style and tuned cushioning to her preferences. In apparel, we delivered strong 10% growth in the quarter and we see a major opportunity ahead. We're getting better every season at capturing the value of one of the world's strongest brands. Obsessing the fundamentals of fleece, T-shirts and outerwear is giving more consumers access to the NIKE brand across a range of price points, and that's being led by seasonal capsules and collections which encourage consumers to keep coming back to the latest chapters of storytelling, color and prints. And this formula has been an especially strong driver for women's sportswear apparel, which grew revenue double digits for the quarter. We've also piloted a new model of launching High Heat apparel on the SNKRS app this quarter. We're taking the energy and storytelling we drive in footwear and amplifying one of our biggest growth opportunities. We're seeing strong sell-through of our apparel collections that we\u2019ve co-designed with collaborations on SNKRS. The Jordan brand on a wholesale equivalent basis just earned its first $1 dollar quarter, an incredible milestone, and just as important is that it was very high quality growth. The brand is very strong internationally and in North America. The marketplace is healthy and in many cases demand is exceeding supply. Performance innovation like the Jordan 34 is complementing one of the world's hottest franchises in the Air Jordan 1. And women's and apparel continue to reach new audiences. What's most exciting is we're still in the early stages of diversifying the Jordan portfolio. And we've continued the momentum into Q3 with a significant holiday launch of the Jordan 11 Bread, meeting demand for one of sneaker culture\u2019s all time favorites at an incredible scale. So, as we look ahead, we're about to enter a hyper-intense cycle of new product introductions with the Tokyo 2020 games and the football Euro Champs on the horizon. Both will be a springboard for new innovation that will help define the performance and aesthetic of NIKE product for years to come. Euro Champs will be another great catalyst for EMEA apparel in the back half of the year. And for the Olympics and Paralympics, we will be revealing the specifics about our Explosive line up next quarter. But you can expect to see the next Air revolution with new approaches to Zoom Air and a renewed VaporMax platform, a celebration of women's basketball like never before, highlighting the opportunity we see to grow the women's game and our business, and our teams using the world stage of Tokyo 2020 to elevate sustainable design at an incredible scale. Across the board, our product teams are proving that innovation is NIKE's greatest competitive edge. Returning athletes\u2019 insights into breakthrough innovation or offering more choice on the industry's top icons, we\u2019re delivering more complete and more productive assortments and we're being opportunistic with the consumer in real time. Another way we continue to create separation is through NIKE's digital advantage. Our digital commerce revenue grew an impressive 38% in Q2, powered by an outstanding performance during our most important holiday moments in November. For Black Friday, digital sales grew over 70% in North America and broke records for the weekend across many of our metrics including our highest week of member engagement ever. Buying members also grew 45% versus last year. We also saw phenomenal success in EMEA with an increase of nearly 50% in demand as Black Friday week grows an importance to the European consumer. Singles' Day showed the current strength of our brand and product portfolio with the Chinese consumer. Through Singles\u2019 Day, we created demand, generating nearly $0.5 billion in revenue. We strengthened our relationships through NIKE+, adding 3 million members. We served our consumer faster, delivering 20% of the 11.11 orders the same day, and we finished as the number one athletic brand on Tmall. China is in many ways the world's most compelling digital marketplace. And while the digital share of the business in Greater China is larger than any other geography for NIKE, we still see so much potential ahead. At the end of Q2, we added the Nike app to a powerful portfolio in China that includes nike.com, SNKRS, NRZ, NTC and our branded experiences with Tmall and WeChat. The Chinese consumers already telling us they're excited about the Nike app, downloading 1 million times during launch. Incredibly, it\u2019s already the number one shopping app in China. Of course, we continue stay engaged with all of our stakeholders in Greater China, monitoring trade conversations and state of consumer across the region. Overall, we feel very good about. The sell-through of our product and the health of our marketplace about our support of the growing community of everyday athletes as well as China's top leads and federation and the immense opportunity to create tailored experiences for the Chinese consumer. We talk a lot about scale of the investments we've been making to fuel our digital transformation, and there are many components. Industry-leading consumer retail experiences that merge online and off-line, new operational capabilities, New operational capabilities and powerful partnerships and all enabled by the digital talent we've added through five recent acquisitions and investments in our teams. The common thread to these work streams is that they put the consumer at the center. They are all designed to reduce friction and create a more direct connection with our customers and ultimately invite them to become members. Membership is the sharp point of our growth. For the quarter SNKRS app grew strong double digits, the Nike app more than doubled and both apps now make up over one-third of our digital revenue. And active users for our apps are growing almost triple digits. The Nike app at retail continues to be one of our greatest opportunities to create scale as we pair the app with physical retail across our owned and partnered doors. Through the Nike app at retail, personalization and convenience moved to another level. Inside the store, members can unlock tailored offers based on their past engagement with NIKE and shop at their pace on the retail floor, scanning products for information and checking out on their own. NIKE's also changing the experience of finding product and how it\u2019s delivered. Members can reserve product online and have it waiting for them at their nearest store, so they can try it on first. Where if they can't a find product they want, new investments in RFID will enable the consumer to instantly track one -- another one down somewhere else in the store, online or potentially in another retail partner\u2019s channel. We have a culture of testing and iterating new retail concepts very quickly, and we're in the early-stages of scaling some of our best ideas around the world at our own doors and with our partners. For example, our first test of Nike Live internationally opened in Shibuya, our smallest Nike Live door in the world, but serving millions through the power of digital. NIKE's not only deeply committed to using our digital advantage to make the consumer experience better, we're also using data science to inform how much product we supply and where. Through our acquisition of Celect, we're applying and developing new unique algorithms to make us better attuned to what the consumer is telling us. We're leveraging data that includes past and present consumer interest in products and purchasing signals to better predict demand, so we can decide how to stage inventory in our distribution centers and our stores in different ways. For Singles\u2019 Day, we shipped products from over 200 stores, instead of DCs, to meet the needs of consumers faster and more profitably. Bringing science to the art of retail remains one of NIKE's greatest opportunities. Before handing it off to Andy, I do want to take a moment to recognize you, our shareholders. Many of you have been invested in NIKE for years, some even decades, and I greatly appreciate your engagement and your long-term focus. As you know, I tend to think more about what's coming than reflecting, but my time as CEO really has been a humbling experience. I\u2019m leaving this role with so much optimism for the future of this Company. Sport continues to inspire and move the world forward in incredible ways. Our brand is connecting deeply with consumers everywhere. Our innovation is helping athletes prove that there are no limits. We're challenging the conventions of retail at every turn. We're growing our biggest businesses and focused on our greatest opportunities, and we're bringing tremendous talent into Nike to add to our already deep bench of leaders. It's clear that sport is thriving, that Nike has the right people and the right plan. What's great is I won't be a spectator to all this success. I'll be part of the team that's creating it. So, with that, for the last time, I'll say thank you, and here's Andy. Andy Campion : Hello and happy holidays to everyone on the call. First, I want to thank and recognize Mark. We've all been fortunate to be guided by Mark\u2019s extraordinary vision and leadership as NIKE\u2019s Chief Executive Officer over the past 14 years. I told Mark this personally, he's the most creative, inquisitive and frankly also the most demanding leader for whom I've ever worked, and at the same time, he's the most patient, thoughtful and balanced. We will all continue to benefit from Mark's leadership as NIKE\u2019s Executive Chairman. We're also extremely fortunate to have John Donahoe joining us as Chief Executive Officer. Few companies are guided by an inspirational founder, as well as a 14-year former CEO and 40-year veteran of the Company and now John Donahoe. John is clearly a proven CEO who brings extraordinary people leadership and talent development experience, as well as deep expertise and strategy, consumer digital technology and enterprise technology. This abundance of strong leadership is yet another competitive advantage that we enjoy at NIKE. And this planful transition is happening as NIKE\u2019s momentum is accelerating, driven by the increasingly deeper execution of our consumer direct offense by our talented teams around the world. As we're still in the early innings of our digital transformation, now, as Mark said, is the perfect time for John to be joining and leading our team. Simply put, I'm extremely excited about the future for NIKE. Before we talk more about the future, let's focus on the present for just a few moments. In Q2, we delivered revenue growth of 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Our strong top line growth was amplified by gross margin expansion and significant SG&A leverage. The result was EPS growing 35%. There are three key strategic and financial themes that stand out as we reflect on our strong Q2 results. First, as we\u2019ve said before, NIKE is a growth company. Growth is how we measure the value we create for consumers, and delivering strong sustainable growth at scale is how NIKE creates extraordinary value for shareholders over the long term. Second, while we will continue to prioritize investments that drive focused growth and build capabilities that differentiate NIKE, we're now also increasingly editing and divesting more deliberately in other areas. Third, we are extending NIKE\u2019s digital advantage, and we're positioning NIKE for even greater competitive separation over the long term. As we transform elements of the consumer journey, our individual investments will have an exponential impact on NIKE's long-term growth, profitability and returns in the aggregate. I'll provide just a bit more context on each of these themes.  First, NIKE is a growth Company. In fact, our rate of growth in constant currency terms has exceeded the long-term financial model that we communicated at our Investor Day in October 2017. More notably, our growth has been profitable, capital efficient and broad-based across our entire global portfolio. That's because our growth is being fueled by focused strategic execution of the Triple Double by our teams around the world. At our Investor Day, we said our goal was to double the percent of revenue generated by recently introduced innovation platforms. In other words, we would 2x innovation. As of this quarter, we have in fact more than tripled innovation as a percent of revenue, and we're not slowing down. We will sustain this level of innovation driven by the incredible breadth and depth of our innovation pipeline, in particular all that we have in store for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Our strong growth also continues to be fueled by an increasingly more direct connection to consumers in the marketplace. Nike Direct grew 17% on a currency-neutral basis in Q2, led by Nike Digital, growing at 38%. Our digital growth was driven primarily by the Nike app and SNKRS app with both now live in over 20 countries. In Q2, we also opened two Nike Live stores in Long Beach, California and Shibuya, Tokyo, which leveraged digital to better serve members within a more moderate sized and efficient physical retail format. Our growth also continues to be balanced across all NIKE brand geographies, that's because we are executing our offense first and foremost in the 12 key cities and 10 key countries with the greatest potential impact. Our growth in Q2 in those cities and countries continues to over index the broader market. That brings me to my second key takeaway. Our investments continue to be focused on the areas where we see the greatest potential to drive growth and on building capabilities that will truly differentiate NIKE. At the same time, we're now increasingly editing and divesting in other areas. Again, at our Investor Day, we told you that we would focus and invest in the following areas, innovation, speed and direct, our priority categories and the 12 key cities and 10 key countries that would deliver over 80% of our incremental revenue growth over the five-year horizon. Over the past two years, that is precisely what we have done, and our results are giving us even greater confidence that we're investing in what matters most. As we all know investing in the future always comes before editing and divesting legacy operating models, but we are now increasingly doing both. We are editing and shifting how we deploy resources within our marketplaces, across our categories and geographically. While we are investing in differentiated NIKE brand experiences, owned and partnered, we are also more efficiently managing the broader retail marketplace, leveraging digital tools such as our NIKE.net business-to-business platform. As a result, we are delivering strong overall revenue growth, despite intentionally flat to declining sales and undifferentiated multi-brand retail. Quite frankly, we could sell more in the short-term in these undifferentiated channels, but our focus is on building a more compelling marketplace for the consumer and unbreakable relationships with Nike members. In early Q3, we also sold the Hurley brand, which has become one of the leading brands in surf apparel. Hurley will benefit from new ownership\u2019s focus on the surf category. Our sale of Hurley will further sharpen NIKE\u2019s focus and investment on the key categories that will drive our long-term growth. Going forward, we will refine our operating model with respect to dimensions of our business that have historically been less profitable and/or have lesser growth potential. For a bit of context, today we currently operate essentially the same business model in over 45 countries. One of our many competitive advantages in Nike is that we have unrivaled resources. The more focused and efficient we are in deploying those resources, the more we will extend NIKE's lead with the consumer and the greater the value we will create for our shareholders. Finally, the third key take-away from the quarter is that we continue to expand NIKE's digital advantage. As we systematically transform individual elements of the consumer journey, the more exponential the impact is on our long-term growth, profitability and returns on invested capital. In Q2, more than half of our total digital traffic came from logged in members. A NIKE member is a consumer host chosen to create a profile with NIKE. Even in just these early stages of digital transformation at NIKE, the average order value for members is significantly greater than for nonmembers. And we're seeing revenue growth from members continue to expand based on two factors, one, strong rates of growth in new members; and two, greater member engagement year-over-year as measured by monthly active users. As we consider investments in transforming how we operate, we always look to our consumer first and more specifically, our members. And assess where we have the greatest potential to improve their experience. It starts with digital demand sensing. Our acquisition of Celect accelerates our ability to better predict the right supply of products that consumers love down to the style, color and size. Celect\u2019s tools will also enable more accurate forward positioning of inventory in stores, online and in our distribution centers. Note that Celect also brings other tools that improve pricing and mark down efficiency As consumers shop, our investments in connected inventory provide our store employees near 100% accurate visibility into the precise location of specific inventory, whether that one payor is in the stock room or elsewhere on the floor at a partner store or one of our distribution centers. And thanks to our investment Invertex, NIKE Fit will give consumers confidence that they are getting the right size in that specific style. Our investments in data and analytics help us learn from each of these consumer experiences and translate those learnings into, for example, curated content, product offerings and more personalized digital experiences for members. And as they say, that which is measured, improves. Our acquisition of Zodiac allows us to assess real-time how each new offering impacts engagement and consumer lifetime value. Transforming the consumer journey also has significant financial impacts. We will capture greater demand at the moment of truth; we will have stronger full price sell-through and more efficient markdowns, we\u2019ll have fewer days in inventory, and we\u2019ll have greater member retention and repeat buying. This digital transformation is beginning to impact our results. In fact, our constant currency revenue growth and margin expansion excluding foreign exchange headwinds over the past two years has exceeded the financial model we communicated at our Investor Day. And we believe that building on our digital advantage is certain to further extend NIKE's lead and amplify our long-term growth potential. Before providing more context on our outlook, I'll first reflect on the details of our financial results overall and for our key operating segments. NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 10% in Q2, up 13% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting strong, balanced growth across the portfolio, led by Greater China and digital. Gross margin expanded by 20 basis points in Q2 as strong gross pricing margin, which is essentially average selling price net of average product costs and strong growth in higher margin Nike Direct was partially offset by the impact of new tariffs implemented in September, strategic supply chain investments and foreign exchange headwinds. SG&A leveraged as compared to revenue growth, growing just 6% in the quarter as investments in digital capabilities were partially offset by productivity within our operating overhead, efficiencies within our demand creation spend, and our decision to defer demand creation to the second half as we ramp up to Air Max Day, the NBA All-Star Weekend, European Championships and the Tokyo Olympics. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.7% compared to 15% for the same period last year, due to greater stock-based compensation benefits. Second quarter diluted EPS was $0.70, growing 35% versus prior year. Inventories were up 15% in dollar terms, 10% in units, reflecting strong consumer demand globally, strong growth in Nike Direct and a higher rate of on-time factory deliveries versus the prior year.  With that, let's turn to our reported operating segments. In North America, Q2 revenue grew 5% on a reported and currency-neutral basis. Nike Digital grew 32% in the quarter, fueled in part by a strong Black Friday. Overall, growth was fueled by those dimensions of the marketplace that we are transforming. In particular, Nike Direct and through differentiated wholesale partners like Foot Locker, JD, Finish Line and DICK\u2019s. We continue to intentionally right size undifferentiated dimensions of the marketplace. We have strong momentum in North America, which makes it the ideal time to affect this transformation. Our key city focus is also fueling North America's transformational growth. New York and Los Angeles are outpacing the broader market. In New York, for example, Nike Direct is already well over 50% of our business and digital is already well over 30% penetrated. We see our momentum continuing in North America over the second half of fiscal year \u201820 with comparable growth in the strong mid-single-digit range. That said, our reported rate of revenue growth will not be comparable. Year-over-year revenue growth in North America will be negatively impacted in the short term by our value-accretive sale of Hurley. This transaction will create a 2-point, roughly 2-point unfavorable comparison on North America revenue growth versus the prior year unadjusted, which equates to roughly 1 point for NIKE, Inc. That said, this is accretive from a capital deployment and profitability perspective. And our North America business on a comparable basis remains strong and we're right on plan. Now, let's turn to EMEA where the NIKE brand is on fire and continues to take significant market share. In Q2, revenue in EMEA grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, with double-digit growth in most key categories, led by Sportswear and Jordan. NIKE continues to be the number one brand in all of our key cities within EMEA. To deepen our brand connection with consumers, we launched two powerful locally relevant campaigns in EMEA in Q2. We launched a kids focused Just Do It campaign, celebrating girls. And on the back of that campaign, we saw our kids business grow strong double-digits. We also launched a campaign around the 30th anniversary of the Berlin Wall coming down, with the focus on the power of sport to Unite. Notably, our increasingly localized approach has resulted in NIKE becoming the number one footwear market leader in Germany. Our women's business also grew faster in EMEA than in any other geography in Q2. Through our Express Lane, we brought the T-100 [ph] women's apparel pack to market in less than 120 days from initial consumer insight. The product sold out immediately through Nike Direct, ASOS and Zalando. On that note, NIKE Digital in EMEA grew 27% in the quarter, faster than any other dimension. We also continued to expand our brand accretive partnership with Zalando including rolling out a connected inventory pilot to 7 countries, based on the strong incremental revenue generated from the initial launch in Germany. We have extraordinary momentum in EMEA and we expect to extend our lead fueled by the Euro Champs and the Olympics over the second half of fiscal year '20 and into fiscal year '21. In APLA, revenue grew 18% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by growth in Korea and Japan. Nike Digital in APLA was up 67% in Q2 and continues to lead all dimensions of growth. We are also putting the NIKE brand in the path of more consumers through our partnerships with digital platforms such as ZOZOTOWN and Flipkart. These partners are affording the NIKE brand and our product premium positioning while also serving as an on-ramp to NIKE membership. In Q2, we also opened our first international NIKE Live store in Shibuya, Tokyo, next to one of the busiest train stations in the world. At the same time, we leveraged our Express Lane to create a unique Air Force 1 inspired by the Shibuya neighborhood and launched through the NIKE SNKRS app. Finally, our running business has tremendous momentum in Japan. NIKE's market share in running reached a record high in Q2, led by the success of the Vaporfly 4% and NEXT%. We're excited to build on this energy with the launch of new styles like the NIKE React Infinity Run next month, and the strong portfolio of innovation to come around the Tokyo Olympics. Now, let's turn to Greater China. This past quarter, we delivered 23% currency-neutral revenue growth in Greater China. We saw a strong double-digit growth in every key category and every dimension of the market. NIKE Digital once again led our growth at plus 44% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by record-breaking single stay that exceeded our own ambitious expectations. We continue to deliver strong digital growth in Greater China despite only having just launched the NIKE app earlier this month. That is one of the many reasons we believe that we -- while we have great current momentum in China, we're still far from realizing our full potential. While we are of course very mindful of the geopolitical dynamics in Greater China, the Nike brand continues to deeply resonate with consumers and our growth continues to be strong and sustainable. We are proactively managing inventory in the Hong Kong market based upon the more recent declines in Hong Kong retail traffic. These actions will create a short-term headwind on what will remain a very strong rate of growth for greater China. With that, I will now share outlook. On a currency-neutral basis, our outlook for the full year continues to improve. For the full year, we now expect currency-neutral revenue growth approaching the low double-digit range, even after taking into account the non-comp impact from the sale of Hurley. With continued geopolitical volatility, we expect foreign exchange to remain at 2 to 3-point headwind on reported revenue growth. Taking into account all of these factors, we continue to expect high single-digit reported revenue growth for the full year. We also continue to expect gross margin expansion within the 50 to 70 basis-point range and SG&A growing in the high-single-digit range, even including the impact of acquisitions. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the low to mid teens and for OIE, net of interest expense, we now expect roughly $100 million to $150 million of income for the year. Based on quarterly volatility, let me provide more context on our Q3 outlook. We expect reported revenue growth in Q3 to be in the high single-digit range, albeit at the very low end of that range. Our continued strong currency-neutral revenue growth will be partially offset by roughly 2 points of foreign exchange headwinds and the non-comp impact related to the sale of Hurley. Put differently, Q3 reported revenue will be in line with our reported revenue growth in Q1. We expect gross margin in Q3 to be flat compared to the prior year. We expect continued strong underlying product margin expansion, reflecting the strength of our product pipeline. However, that expansion will be largely offset by tariffs in North America and investments in our supply chain. In addition, foreign exchange headwinds within gross margin will be more in line with what we reported back in Q1. The impact of geopolitical trade dynamics on FX and more recently tariffs do create quarterly anomalies. That said, as we all know, one quarter or one data point does not equate to a trend. Over the past two years, our gross margin expansion has significantly exceeded our goals but for these dynamics. And again, for the full year, we continue to expect 50 to 75 basis points of gross margin expansion. We see continued strong fundamental expansion in our margin fueled by our strong product pipeline and the higher rate of growth in Nike Direct. In Q3, we expect SG&A growth in the low-double-digit to low-teens range, driven by our decision within Q2 to shift demand creation into the second half in order to amplify the NBA All-Star Weekend, European Championships, the Tokyo Olympics and our launch of innovative new products. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the low to mid teens range. For OIE net of interest expense, we expect income in Q3 to be roughly $50 million to $75 million. Q2 was another strong quarter, fueled by execution of the consumer direct offense by our unrivaled team around the world. That said, as Mark will continue to remind all of us, there is no finish line. We are still in the early stages of this transformation at NIKE with tremendous growth potential ahead of us. I could not be more excited about the future for NIKE. With that, we\u2019ll now open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Your line is open. Bob Drbul : Hey. Good afternoon. And Mark, good luck on the next chapter. And thanks for all of the help over the last numerous years. It\u2019s been a lot of fun. Mark Parker : Thanks, Bob. I appreciate that. Yes. Bob Drbul : I guess, the first question I have is, if we could just talk about in quarter, but can you talk a little bit about the North American apparel market and sort of the performance and/or the outlook, and sort of some of the assumptions, there's been a lot of press recently around the MLB partnership that you are launching right now? Andy Campion : Yes. I\u2019ll take that one, Bob. Overall -- I'll start just overall with our apparel business. We've got incredible momentum in the apparel business overall. Globally, apparel grew 10% in the quarter. And frankly, we think we have much greater opportunities ahead that we haven't even yet capitalized on and we've spoken quite a bit about that. Our international geographies growth has been phenomenal, Sportswear and Jordan are leading the growth, lifestyle apparel for both men and women. In North America in particular, the rate of growth in the quarter was impacted by prior year comparison. So, in the prior year, this may sound like not that significant of an impact, but it actually was. The shift of LeBron James to the Lakers and the initial impact from the sale of his jerseys was significant. But for that, the growth rate in North America would have been more in the mid-single-digit range. For context, what I would tell you is that in the prior year North America apparel actually grew 10% in part, aided by that comparison. So, we continue to feel one, both great about the state of our apparel business and brand in North America, but at the same time nowhere near satisfied in terms of the opportunities ahead that we have to really drive more epic growth in apparel. Bob Drbul : Got it. Okay. And then, if I could just ask a follow-up for Mark, sort of a closing question for you. With all the attention on the Vaporfly NEXT%, I was just wondering, can you just share with us how much you shaved off your personal record or personal best with the pair of shoes that you've been using? Mark Parker : Okay. Well, I can just tell you that the time it takes me to walk across the NIKE campus here, at headquarters, has dropped by at least 4%. So, feeling good about it, feeling really good. Operator : Your next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Paul Trussell : I wanted to touch on gross margins, a number of puts and takes going on. Maybe just touch first on what transpired in the second quarter, especially relative to your expectations? And maybe give a little bit more detail around the updated kind of third quarter and second half guidance. Thank you. Andy Campion : Sure. I'll start with that one, Paul. In the quarter, as you know, our gross margin expansion landed about as closest we\u2019ve ever been to the guidance that we have provided. So, at the same time, there are some really important highlights to call within our margin. Our gross pricing margin as we call it, so that's our average selling prices net of product costs were very strong. We had strong average selling price increases, thanks to the strong product pipeline that we have and the innovation that we\u2019ve bringing to market. Of course, some of the other impacts in the quarter included tariffs. Tariffs in the quarter were roughly 40 to 50 basis-point impact, obviously pretty significant, if you were to add that back alone. So, that's the second impact I'd call out. We also continue to make investments in our supply chain. A little bit of detail there. We are expanding our distribution center capacity in the Memphis and Mississippi areas to increase both, capacity and speed, especially with our growing digital business and omnichannel strategy with online to offline services. We are expanding some apparel distribution capability in EMEA, which again is reflective of just a great opportunity we see ahead in apparel and the momentum that we have in that market. Tokyo and Mexico City are also areas we\u2019re investing in our supply chain. We\u2019ve invested more broadly across our entire supply chain, putting RFID in our product. We now have RFID in about 100% of our footwear, about three quarters of our apparel. And for a little context, the benefits of that are still to come. So, the RFIDs in the product, the ability to scan and the distribution centers is significant with at least eight of our distribution centers having that ability. We're still in the early stages of growing out the ability to leverage that in stores, but it\u2019s happening, but more in the dozens of stores. FX was an impact. Although that's one of the things -- I'll end there by saying, there are a lot of puts and takes within margin in any given quarter. And I would tell you not to focus on a quarterly margin expansion results, especially in these times as indicative of the trend. The real trend is strong gross pricing margin, the shift to our Nike Direct, the ability to capture more-full price sell-through et cetera. But, if I was to give you one of the more distinctive variances between Q3 and Q2, FX was in maybe the 15 basis-point headwind zone in Q2, and we see the impact of FX being more in line with what we saw in Q1, which is, say roughly 50 basis points. So, that alone more than more equates for the difference between what we delivered in Q2 and guidance. Paul Trussell : That's helpful color. Thank you. Maybe turning now to SG&A. Just maybe talk a little bit more about the timing shift and just also how should we be thinking bigger picture as we move towards all of these key sporting events, especially the excitement around Tokyo 2020 as it relates to demand creation expenses, and how maybe some of that will be offset by where you are finding some efficiencies in the operations. Thank you. Andy Campion : Yes. I guess, what I\u2019ll start by saying is, if you reflect on Q2, we both had stronger revenue than we expected going into the quarter. And obviously what you can infer is we felt less of a need to spend demand creation in the quarter to drive it. We\u2019ve got an incredibly strong pull market and just had and have great momentum. And so, in the spirit of realizing we\u2019ve got unrivaled resources in this industry, it's even more important than what we see an opportunity to really leverage those resources in a focused way. We make decisions and shift real-time. So, we looked at the situation and said we didn\u2019t mean that demand creation in Q2, we want to save that powder so to speak for the big events and the big launches that we have in the second half of the year and going into fiscal year 2021. So, that\u2019s really the biggest driver of that shift in SG&A. To your question about Tokyo, Mark's probably the best person to give color on how excited we are about the product. But, you can infer from us wanting to shift. Part of demand creation is getting our voice out there and communicating the benefits of our product and how excited we are, and we in fact are. That\u2019s why we have deferred that demand creation. Mark Parker : Yes. I\u2019ll just quickly add that the excitement around Tokyo is tremendous here at NIKE in terms of what's coming in the innovation pipeline. I mentioned, performance product that we have coming for Tokyo both in footwear and apparel. And then, we're leveraging that across sportswear and I think for men and women. So it's really a complete offense plan around Tokyo. And we think we have, to Andy's point, a lot to leverage with that demand creation spend. This is a big moment for us. This is every four years and we really rally around this event in a major way. So, the impact on the revenue you're going to see in the year but you're also going to see it carry on and influence our potential going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Alex Walvis : Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question here. So, first question is on North America footwear and strong acceleration in that category and the region during the quarter. Can you give us a little bit more detail on what's driving that from a styles and channels perspective, and perhaps any feedback from your partners on the new styles that are selling into that channel? Mark Parker : Yes. I speak to complete offense quite a bit and the second half of the fiscal year we're really trying to dial up our offense, particularly in the core product, footwear product innovation, states and some of the new styles we have coming there, I think will give us a real boost in the second half. The reaction from retailers has been very positive, in terms of some of the new styles we got including the React product that we have coming. It\u2019s a new version React called Infinity React Run, which is actually higher performance shoes that we think will give us more access to that core runner. We have new core running styles coming in underneath that as well, both in men's and women's styles. We also have Air Max coming down into the core price range selectively leveraging the Air Max platform. We have others. If you look at some of the other styles we've got on the sportswear side, we've got Dunk, Blazer, the MJ product is -- the MJ Air Force -- or I'm sorry, the Air Jordan 1. Our Air Force 1 continues to be actually very strong for us. We\u2019re continuing to iterate new styles on both of those franchises. And with the addition of the Blazer and the Dunk in the mix, we think that that'll continue to create some good momentum for us on the footwear side. So, it's really a more complete offense for the second half on footwear with a big emphasis on core for us, particularly on our own channel in the digital direct space. So, we think that's going to be a good boost for us. Alex Walvis : Second question, if I may is on Converse, really strong momentum in that brand now for another quarter. Can you talk about what's driving this growth rate there? And then, it seems to be that that is focused on international regions. Is there anything you can share on the outlook for North America and whether that can meet the growth rates seen elsewhere? Mark Parker : Yes, much of the growth at Converse is being led by international, specifically Asia Pacific, really led by China, and then we're also seeing strong performance in EMEA, and much of that also is driven by digital. So, we're seeing incredible momentum for Converse really starting to build in those markets. We have some gaps to close in North America. I think. We are continuing to differentiate our product line beyond the Chuck. And I think that all creates more opportunities for us in basketball or looking at running and some other dimensions of the Converse footwear portfolio, apparel as well. We are seeing by the way strong growth in North America for Converse in the digital space. So, we think that's a sign of some optimism for us for Converse in North America going forward. And I think, the expansion of our digital platform for Converse is going to be a driver globally, certainly led currently by China, but we'll start to see that happen more and more in North America and for Europe. Andy Campion : And I'd just add one thing. Mark spoke about adding diversification relative to the Chuck business. We've got some real momentum within the Chuck franchise, in particular driven by a style called the Chuck 70, which is growing really strong double to triple digits in all geographies. In fact, it's already a pretty significant percent of total Chuck business in markets like China and elsewhere and it's ramping up quickly in the U.S. So, we see great energy in terms of, as Mark would say, providing more choice and differentiation within a style that has the kind of expansive opportunity that the Chuck has. And that is a more premium version of the Chuck, which also kind of raises tentpole and adds the opportunity to expand on that franchise. Operator : Your next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Omar Saad : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the great run, Mark. Mark Parker : Thank you. Omar Saad : So, while I have you in a reflective mood, I'd love to hear your thoughts on two things. Number one, the decision to terminate the Amazon trial, maybe you could get into a little bit into the why, and what might get the NIKE brand to come back? And the second question I have, as the NIKE, Inc. CEO and having seen the various evolutions of the portfolio, do you think NIKE is going to be a multi-brand or a monogram company 10 years from now. And the reason I asked is, on the one hand you're talking about kind of shutting some of the legacy assets and you've divested Hurley, but on the other hand you are talking about -- describing this amazing kind of asset [Technical Difficulty] capabilities from back end to front end, and it feels like maybe there is an opportunity to plug some great brands in your platform and leverage what you we felt. So, I would love your kind of musings on those two topics. Thanks. Mark Parker : Yes. Well, we have a clear framework for partners in the digital space, and what's guiding us is really to be in the path of the consumer in a way that's really right for the brand. We continue to see, just on a macro basis great momentum with our partners, including partners like Instagram and Google and Tmall and WeChat. So, brand right is really what's important here. And that's building those relationships with the consumer through better presentation I think elevated, authentic, consumer experiences on whatever digital platform. And this means ensuring that we have an environment where the consumer can be certain that they're buying authentic NIKE product from authorized retailers. So, that's been our focus as to really be -- to elevate the brand, strengthen the connection with consumer much like we do with the differentiated wholesale strategy. So, that's kind of led us to our decision in terms of moving forward. We have -- your second question on multiple brands or one brand, mono brand, I would say pretty convincingly or confidently that we will be a multi-brand company in the future. We have multiple brands now, Nike, Jordan, Converse. We see tremendous upside potential with those brands. We're in the early stages of strengthening our portfolio and expanding our portfolio within the Jordan brand. Obviously, Sportswear is very strong, performance basketball, there is more upside, other performance categories, there is upside, apparel, women's, international growth. So, there is tremendous growth opportunity within that Jordan brand for NIKE. And then, Converse, likewise. So, I think, as we just talked about, as we diversify that portfolio, strengthen our position in North America, tremendous upside I think for the Converse brand. And taking some of that pressure off of NIKE to be everything everybody, I think that's important. And then, we can leverage our capabilities, our digital capabilities for example, across the portfolio. And then, I think as we transform our operating model, we\u2019ll enable more and more opportunity for that broader NIKE portfolio. Omar Saad : Congratulations on job. Well done. Mark Parker : Thank you, Omar. Thank you very much. Matt Friend : Operator, one last call before we wrap up. Operator : Our last question comes from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Matthew Boss : Great. Thanks. Nice quarter. And Mark contras on the transition. Mark Parker : Thank you. Matthew Boss : I guess, so with this -- with five straight quarters of double-digit constant currency revenue growth, I guess maybe at a higher level, Mark, what do you see that\u2019s been driving the upside versus your high-single-digit growth algorithm? And what\u2019s your confidence in the multiyear product and innovation pipeline to sustain the stronger momentum. Mark Parker : Well, I can honestly say, I\u2019ve never been more confident than I\u2019m right now. What's driving those results, those consistently strong results are not only the innovative product that really is where the consumer votes ultimately. So, the product has to be strong, the complete offense of products, footwear and apparel up and down the price points across the categories, men's and women's. I think we\u2019ve been driving a more complete offense, and much of that has been driven by the innovation that represents so much more of the percentage of our revenue growth than it had even just a few years ago. So, that's absolutely critical. And then, of course, I\u2019d say we get teased for saying digital transformation, as much as we do. But, it's clearly driving some incredible results for us. And I sit here today firmly believing and more confident than ever that that will continue to drive great opportunity and upside for us. And I\u2019m excited to have John come in and be a part of accelerating that transformation for us going forward. It's going to be to me a win-win situation between the incredible team we have on the field today. John with his expertise, my guidance, continue to focus on things that I think are really important for the Company, particularly in the innovation, design product, marketing space. I think, those continue to be core fundamental driving principles for Nike's and that's exciting for me going forward.  And then, lastly I will say is, what's really driving all of this, all the above is the team that we have here. We have incredible talent at Nike, not only individual talent across the Company, the functions, the geos, the categories, but the collective team and how that teams come together. It\u2019s really -- the chemistry of the team is one of those things that does get talked about its business very often. But we have great chemistry and incredibly competitive driven team and that ultimately is what's going to drive the success of any company. And that's certainly the case here at Nike. Matthew Boss : That\u2019s great. Congrats again on the quarter. Thank you, Mark. Mark Parker : Thank you. Matt Friend : Thanks, Matt. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Happy holidays to everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

Before I turn the call over to Mr. Friend, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including the annual report filed on Form 10-K. Some forward-looking statements may concern expectations of future revenue growth or gross margin. In addition, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to constant-dollar revenue. References to constant-dollar revenue are intended to provide context as to the performance of the business eliminating foreign exchange fluctuations. Participants may also make references to other non-public financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures. To the extent non-public financial and statistical information is discussed, presentations of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations will be made available at NIKE\u2019s website, http://investors.NIKE.com. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt Friend, CFO, Operating Segments and Vice President, Investor Relations. Matt Friend : Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal 2020 third quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about one hour ago or at our website, investors.NIKE.com. Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe; and our Chief Financial Officer, Andy Campion. We are sitting together in a conference room six-feet apart, practicing social distancing. Following Andy and John's prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So, we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to two. In the event you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue, and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I will now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe. John Donahoe : Thanks, Matt, and hello to everyone on the call. Over the last quarter, NIKE delivered 7% currency-neutral revenue growth, despite the material impact from COVID-19 in China. This performance reflects the strong business momentum we had in Q3 across all of our geographies and categories. But, let's take a step back. We're living in an unprecedented moment. And like never before, each day requires a close inspection of a very dynamic external environment, and a clear determination of how we will respond. So, let me tell you what we've seen over the past two months. When COVID-19 began to aggressively spread across China in late January, our top priority was to protect the health and safety of our teammates and our consumers. We immediately began closing stores. And as of 45 days ago, we had closed more than 5,000 stores in Greater China, while the remaining open doors were operating with severely reduced hours. Not surprisingly, retail volume in China plummeted. But, we acted quickly and decisively, leveraging our diverse sourcing base and digital capabilities to manage the business with flexibility, and shifting our inventory to serve consumer digital demand. At a time when people were confined to their homes, we moved swiftly to leverage our digital app ecosystem and NIKE expert trainer network to inspire and support consumers across China to stay active and connected while at home. As a result, our NIKE Training Club workouts in China saw an extraordinary rise in signup and engagement. In fact, our weekly active users for all of our NIKE activity apps were up 80% by the end of Q3 versus the beginning of the quarter. And here's what happened. The strong engagement of Chinese consumers with our activity apps translated into strong engagement with our NIKE commerce app. As a result, our digital business in China grew more than 30% and maintained strong momentum throughout this challenging period, a powerful statement of NIKE\u2019s agile problem-solving in times of disruption. Then approximately 30 days ago, we began to gradually reopen stores in China. People got back to work and retail traffic began improving significantly. Today, nearly 80% of our stores in China have reopened with more coming back on line every day. In fact, just last week, we reopened our first store in the Wuhan area. And the results are encouraging. Our digital business in China has accelerated even further over the past month, and we are now seeing double-digit increases in retail traffic week-over-week with some stores having already returned to prior year levels. Credit for this response goes to Angela Dong, who leads our Greater China geography, and her talented team of more than 1,600. I spoke with Angela two nights ago, and she's been telling me about the positive sentiment consumers in China are feeling for NIKE. And I can't overstate how impressed I am. It's become quite clear to me that when NIKE says we are a brand of China for China, it's really true. And it's no surprise to see the business already rebounding, given the depth of our connection, and the incredible strength of our local leadership team. So, today, I can say that we're seeing the other side of the crisis in China. And due to the resilience and creativity of our team in China, we now have a playbook that we can use elsewhere. In addition to Greater China, we've applied that playbook in Japan and South Korea over the past two months, and we're seeing early momentum in those markets as well. And with COVID-19 now spreading across Europe and the U.S., we are applying the same playbook. We have prioritized the health and safety of our teammates, and we've closed our stores. Over the weekend, we drove a strong digital marketing campaign to engage consumers across Europe and across the U.S. to stay healthy and connected while they're at home. And our digital commerce remains open and in growth mode, supported by our teammates in our distribution centers. We also know that this is a moment in society where the private sector has a major role to play. Companies like NIKE need to do our part. So, our teams in innovation and manufacturing are exploring designs for personal protective equipment or PPE to support doctors, nurses and others on the frontline of this outbreak. Based on needs identified by the teams and health professionals at Oregon Health & Science University, our teammates are working right now about how to best help, including prototyping face shields of OHSU and others. It's been so energizing to see the quick strike efforts of the cross-functional team to try to help with this critical need. That said, we expect the next several weeks to be a challenging period for those living in the U.S. and Europe. And I can't precisely predict how long the containment phase of the outbreak will last. But, our experience in China, Japan and South Korea gives us confidence that we will see the other side of this crisis in the near future. And I can assure you this, as the situation continues to evolve, we will be ready and we will respond. We'll be guided by our values, and we will execute with empathy and with decisiveness. For instance, we'll continue to maintain pay continuity, even while our facilities are closed or have altered schedules. We know that our people are vital to fueling our deep connections with consumers, whether they work in our stores or in our enter distribution centers. And what's more, it's simply the right thing to do. So, while this is an uncertain and challenging time, NIKE has the foundation in place to emerge from it stronger than ever. Thanks to our competitive advantages, the power of our brand in connection with consumers, our digital capabilities, our compelling product innovation and most importantly, our extraordinary team, we will manage our business back to full recovery. We know in times like these that strong brands get even stronger. And I truly believe that no one is better equipped than NIKE to navigate the current climate. So, with that said, let's go a bit deeper. I spent the last 90 days digging into this extraordinary Company. I thought I knew NIKE after five years on the board, but believe me, when you get to dive even deeper, this place is even more impressive than I imagined. Let me walk you through what I've learned through the lens of the four strengths I just mentioned : Our strong brand; our digital advantage; our product innovation; and our extraordinary team. These are the strengths that will continue to set us apart and these are the strengths that will allow us to shape the future marketplace going forward. Since I started as CEO in January, I have visited with our teams in several of our key cities, experiencing firsthand our deep connections with local consumers around the world as well as our innovative retail concepts. I've also had the opportunity to meet with many of our most important strategic partners. During my first week as CEO in early January, I spent time in China and Japan before the virus took hold. I got to see firsthand just how deeply the NIKE Jordan and Converse brands are connecting with consumers, both in compelling retail executions and in the many ways that NIKE partners with regional local governments to grow physical activity and sport. Our brand is driving these powerful connections to consumers worldwide. In fact, we were the number one favorite brand in all 12 of our key cities in Q3 and we continue to gain market share in key cities such as Berlin, Mexico City and Tokyo. And during a time of physical store closures around the world, we know that our digital foundation will help us emerge out of this situation in an even stronger position. For instance, in Q3 digital delivered 36% currency-neutral growth and it will continue to be a powerful driver of our deep consumer connections. As I mentioned early, we are executing our learnings from China about fueling sport and fitness all over the world. We're using our digital advantage to connect with and support our consumers as behaviors around staying healthy at home continue to evolve. Over the weekend, we made the NTC Premium free for everyone in the U.S. for 90 days. NTC Premium offers the best on-demand workouts and expert tips from our master trainers and others, as well as inspiration and support for healthy living. Digital remains our fastest growing channel with owned and partnered digital already representing more than 20% of our overall business. And our apps continue to be the sharp point of our growth with the NIKE app growing revenue close to triple digits once again in Q3, fueling member acquisition and strong monthly engagement. And while we've driven impressive results in acquiring new members, engaging them and fueling increased digital demand, we know that the opportunity here is still far greater than what we've realized to-date, and will become an even greater advantage for NIKE as we move forward. And even while our stores remain closed in Europe and the U.S., we continue to work on defining the future of seamless, physical and digital retail. To expand the advantage we have in digital, we continue to invest in our NIKE Direct businesses, enhancing rich experiences like those and the NIKE app at retail. And we're increasingly concentrating on our online to offline journey and accelerating our work to fully connect the marketplace while creating frictionless experiences for consumers throughout the world. Another clear competitive advantage is our product innovation. Our product and innovation have always set NIKE apart from others. And I firmly believe this will become even more important of a differentiator as we look ahead. Over the past couple of months, I've spent a lot of time with our innovation, design, product and merchandising teams. I've done several deep dives in these areas, and I am truly blown away. As a Board member, you get to see a lot, but you can never fully understand how impressive NIKE\u2019s product innovation capability is, until you spend time with our teams. For instance, today, we have more than 1,000 designers working at Nike with broad and deep talent across footwear and apparel. And you can just feel how their creativity and vision for product inspires everyone here and inspires consumers around the world. I got to see some of this innovative product on display at the NIKE 2020 Forum last month in New York, which served as a great illustration of the power of our 2 times innovation offense. There, we announced a powerful array of breakthrough product, such as our NEXT% footwear line, which offers measurable benefits to consumers. We also launched a new aesthetic for sustainability, where we're delivering news scalable platforms like no one else. And by bringing together athletes and creative partners as only NIKE can, the forum was an optimistic statement about the future of sport culture. And our vantage goes beyond our incredible product pipeline. It has become even more clear to me why NIKE leads the industry. Our innovation, product and design teams have an unrelenting commitment to discovering what's next. This culture of innovation is pervasive across our organization and deeply embedded within NIKE teams around the world, from those who engage consumers at retail, to those creating the next wave of digital experiences that connect with consumers daily. Fueled by data and analytics capabilities, we are equipped with deep consumer insight that we combine with our design expertise and athlete research. This process directly translates into breakthrough product, season-after-season, allowing us to drive more separation in the marketplace. There's one last thing I'd like to mention. As you know, the organized sports world remains on hold and yet the global culture of health and wellness continues unabated. In fact, in many ways, people are looking to health and wellness now more than ever. Whether it's to stay in shape at home or with the focus on mental health in stressful times, people all over the globe are finding ways to make sport a daily habit wherever, whenever and however they can. And as you may have seen, this past weekend, we encouraged consumers worldwide to workout at home with a simple message, Play Inside, Play For The World. We're seeing new behaviors normalize in countries all over the globe. And we're shifting our entire consumer ecosystem to deliver access to sports that speaks to consumers\u2019 changing laws. Across key markets, we're working to create shared experiences and opportunity for virtual participation, connecting people to something bigger and showing how sport can inspire. And though there's no predicting when organized sports will restart, when our athletes, teams and leagues can return to competition, I do have one guarantee. When the gates reopen, when the first whistle sounds, the energy is going to be off the charts. The world's passion for sports remains undiminished. And when it all returns, NIKE will be right there with sports fans everywhere. In summary, I'm incredibly proud of our team and the results they delivered in Q3. And amidst unprecedented conditions across the globe, we are staying focused on not simply managing through this situation but taking the actions that will allow us to emerge from it even stronger than before. We know it won't be easy, but NIKE is better prepared than anyone else to regain that momentum, extend our brand leadership and reshape the future marketplace. NIKE has a long history of rising to the occasion in extraordinary times, to deliver strong results and effect extraordinary change in the world of sport and beyond. And that's what we're going to do once again. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Andy. Andy Campion : Thanks, John, and hello to everyone on the call. Before I speak to our business, our priority right now is first and foremost our people. Ensuring the health, safety and wellbeing of our teammates around the world is the foundation for all of the business decisions we're making. We have a message [ph] in NIKE, we win as a team. And I can tell you that the resilience, strength, empathy and creativity of our teammates has never been on greater display. Our team has always been NIKE\u2019s greatest advantage. On that note, I want to congratulate one of my teammates, Matt Friend, on his new role going forward. Matt and I have worked closely together since he joined NIKE 11 years ago. He's been a great thought partner to me over that time, and we're working seamlessly together through this transition. As I move into my new role at NIKE, I could not be more confident in NIKE\u2019s financial management with Matt as our CFO. So, as we close Q3 and look ahead, we see three key themes. First, as we enter these challenging circumstances, NIKE\u2019s brand leadership and business momentum have been stronger than ever, and unrivaled around the world. In Q3, we delivered 7% currency-neutral revenue growth overall, led by 13% growth in both EMEA and APLA. NIKE Greater China was also on pace to deliver another quarter of strong double-digit revenue growth prior to the impact of COVID-19. And in North America, our strong mid-single-digit reported rate of revenue growth would have been roughly 3 points higher if not for non-comparable items including the sale of Hurley and our shift to a licensed business model with Fanatics relative to the NFL. While those transactions had a negative impact on our year-over-year revenue growth comparisons, they also result in higher profitability for NIKE. Across all of our geographies and Converse, [ph] digital remained our fastest growing channel, growing 36% on a currency-neutral basis. In fact each of our geographies and Converse exceeded 30% digital revenue growth in the quarter. Our growth was also broad-based across categories as well as across women's and men's, all fueled by innovation platforms and power franchises such as the Air Max 270, the Air Force 1 and the Air Jordan 1.  Our launch of the Air Jordan 11 BRED was the largest in our history with the product selling out in 28 minutes, powered by the SNKRS app. In fact, the Jordan brand grew double digits globally in the quarter. The LeBron 17, Giannis 7 Freak and the City Edition NBA jerseys fueled basketball strong growth. And in running, we unveiled our most advanced performance running shoe ever, the Alphafly NEXT%. We also launched the new Infinity React designed to help runners run longer. And we've seen a very strong sell-through, particularly with women. Apparel, also fueled growth in the quarter, growing faster than footwear with double-digit apparel growth in our sportswear training, basketball, women's and kids\u2019 categories. Setting aside the non-cash non-recurring charges related to our business model, changes in South America, NIKE, Inc.\u2019s earnings exceeded the earnings that were implied in the financial guidance we provided 90 days ago. We were able to deliver that strong bottom-line performance even including the impact of COVID-19 on Greater China. The second key theme as we look ahead relates to how we're addressing the evolving implications of COVID-19. As John said, we are executing on an operational playbook, focused on positioning NIKE for an expedited return to profitable, capital efficient growth. We see each of our markets progressing through a time series that begins with the country addressing the COVID-19 outbreak, followed by three phases from a business perspective : One, a recovery period, including for example the ramp-up of store re-openings; two, a period of normalization across consumer demand and supply; and three, a period in which we return to strong growth. Why are we so confident in our approach? As John said, our team in Greater China has given us a playbook for the rest of the world. Based upon the most recent trends we see today, NIKE Greater China has already progressed through their recovery phase and is now transitioning into the normalization phase. Specifically, we are seeing accelerating strong double-digit, approaching triple-digit growth in our NIKE Digital business. At the same time, roughly 80% of our 7,000 brick and mortar NIKE owned and partner stores are now open. Based on the latest trends in our business, NIKE Greater China Q4 revenue will likely be roughly flat versus Q4 of fiscal year \u201819. We're also executing on this playbook in Japan and Korea. Both markets are entering the normalization phase, fueled by strong digital growth and significant week-over-week increases in retail traffic and demand for NIKE. Based on what we're experiencing in China, Korea and Japan, we are optimistic. At the same time, this has become a global pandemic. Each country is addressing COVID-19 differently. And accordingly, our markets will progress through the three phases from a business perspective on different timelines. That adds some complexity from a global point-of-view. So, we're also executing against a top-down enterprise-wide operational plan. Our top-down plan includes, one, tight cost management; and two, daily global demand and supply optimization. Accordingly, our Q4 SG&A will be lower than prior year Q4 spending. We're also taking decisive action with respect to supply on a global basis, while shifting our distribution focus to digital in the face of temporary retail store closures. As a result, Q4 fiscal year '20 and fiscal year '21 year-over-year revenue, margin and inventory growth rates will neither be intuitive nor linear. Our measures of success in the near-term will be rooted in the amount of inventory on hand relative to the pace of digital demand, store re-openings and traffic patterns. Now, going into this, we were fortunately experiencing a very strong pull market for NIKE globally with some of the highest rates of full price sell-through we've ever experienced. So, we're now aggressively managing all of our operating levers to ensure that we expedite NIKE\u2019s return to that strong pull market. Realigning supply and demand is our focus operationally. We're also executing this plan, leveraging two of NIKE\u2019s longstanding and greatest competitive advantages. First NIKE\u2019s financial strength. Liquidity will not be an issue for NIKE. In order to ensure resilience during challenging times, we have long maintained a strong balance sheet, a strong investment grade credit rating, and ample access to capital, all coupled with strong operating cash flow generation. NIKE\u2019s liquidity and access to capital are for just the ability to be principled, for example, with respect to pay continuity and decisive relative to real-time supply and demand management.  Second, we have forged the strongest partnerships across the value chain in this industry. That includes among others our marketplace partners like Topsports, Pou Sheng and Tmall in China, as well as Foot Locker, DICK's JD and Zalando, across the U.S. and Europe. Of course, we also have longstanding partnerships that span decades with manufacturers such as Feng Tay, Shen Zhou, Changshin and many others.  We're working closely with all of these strategic partners on a daily basis. Our partners recognize that the stronger NIKE is going forward, the stronger they are. Of course, NIKE is not operating in isolation. External factors will continue to be dynamic, and we will continue to adjust our execution accordingly. The third key theme as we look forward. While the setbacks from a business perspective will be significant for all, Nike will come back even stronger as a brand and as a company. Consumer behaviors change in real time. We're all witnessing new normals emerge in terms of both, how consumer shop and stay active. Sport is being redefined as much broader than competition, as the world finds new and creative ways to stay healthy and fit. And NIKE\u2019s digital ecosystem is keeping us connected real time. From a marketplace perspective, NIKE Digital growth is accelerating amidst these dynamics. From a digital capability perspective, the investments we've made to-date are now proving to be foundation for our resilience amidst challenge, and they will be strength as we emerge. For example, we're leveraging select teams and tools to dynamically model demand, pricing, planning and allocation. We're leveraging our NIKE membership platform and NIKE mobile app ecosystem to inspire and enable people to be active at home while also providing targeted product offers and services to consumers. And the foundation we\u2019ve built in enterprise data and analytics is fueling our more agile end-to-end execution. As we said, we're still in the early earnings of NIKE\u2019s digital transformation, but the capabilities we've already been building for the future are proving to be the strongest pillars within our business today. As John said, simply put, these are times in which strong brands get stronger, and we're confident that NIKE will come back stronger than ever. Now, let's turn to the details of our third quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. Q3 revenue grew 5%, up 7% on a currency-neutral basis, reflecting strong balanced growth across EMEA, APLA, North America and Greater China prior to the impact of COVID-19, all fueled by NIKE Digital growing 36% versus prior year. Gross margin declined by 80 basis points in Q3 as higher average selling prices and better off price margin were offset by the impact of COVID-19, primarily in Greater China as we managed inventory sell-through in that market. Gross margin was also negatively impacted by FX headwinds and incremental tariffs in North America. SG&A grew 6% in Q3. We continued to invest in our digital transformation, while also beginning to more tightly manage operating overhead and shift demand creation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 3.9% compared to 14.7% for the same period last year, due to a shift in the proportion of earnings taxed in the U.S., and increased benefits from discrete items. Third quarter diluted EPS was $0.53, including the $0.25 noncash nonrecurring FX-related charge associated with the transition of Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay to strategic distributor models. As of February 29th, inventories were up 7% compared to the prior period, reflecting healthy, full-price versus off-price mix prior to the impact of COVID-19. With that, let's turn to our reported operating segments. In North America, Q3 revenue grew 4% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, which again would have been approximately 3 points higher, adjusting for the sale of Hurley and our partnership with Fanatics regarding the NFL business. In Q3, NIKE Digital grew over 30% and the NIKE app grew over 60% in North America. New York City and LA each grew double digits, fueled by differentiated NIKE consumer experiences. As an example, in LA, we launched our newest NIKE Live concept store in Glendale, which blew past our expectations and significantly over-indexed in terms of the women's business. Now, as of today, we've closed our owned stores in North America. Going forward, we will reopen stores on a location-by-location basis as we closely monitor development. At the same time, NIKE Digital demand has been extraordinary with NIKE Digital commerce sales over just the past few days approaching holiday peak levels, growing triple digits over just the past week. We\u2019ve maintained operations in our distribution centers, implementing social distancing and reduced staffing while focusing on the shipment of digital orders. Now, let's turn to a EMEA where we continue to build on our extraordinary brand momentum. In Q3, revenue in EMEA grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis with double-digit growth in most key categories. Women's growth strongly outpaced men's, apparel accelerated faster than footwear, and digital was up over 40%. The NIKE brand has never been stronger in EMEA. In every key city in EMEA, consumers rated NIKE their number one favorite and cool brand. We also gained significant market share in Q3 across both, footwear and apparel, driving further brand separation. Greater speed and agility also fueled our growth and share gains in EMEA in Q3 with over 30% of EMEA revenue and nearly 80% of EMEA incremental growth flowing through our Express Lane. In order to help limit the spread of COVID-19, we have also closed our owned stores in Western Europe and select Eastern European markets. And similar to the U.S., we will reopen on a location-by-location basis, based on developments. NIKE Digital continues to grow versus prior year and we're maintaining operations in our distribution centers, again, shifting their focus towards digital distribution. In our APLA geography, revenue grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was fueled by our key cities and was balanced across key categories, nearly all of which were up double digits. The Jordan brand in particular was incredibly strong in APLA, growing nearly 50% in the quarter with new innovation like the Jordan Max 200 along with fresh new approaches to Jordan Icon, all resonating with consumers. In performance running, our accelerating momentum continued, especially in Japan where we've dominated Hakone Ekiden competitive race, seeing a record 84% of participants wearing NIKE. The energy around running in Japan is being fueled by the Vaporfly NEXT% as well as a halo effect that is impacting other performance models like the Zoom Fly, Rival Fly and Peg Turbo, which all grew triple digits in Q3. NIKE Digital grew 51% and wholesale grew double digits overall on a currency-neutral basis, as business with our differentiated strategic partners grew 5 times as fast as undifferentiated distribution. As we said, APLA is our most diverse geography. So, we're seeing the impact of COVID-19 very significantly across Asian and Latin American countries. With that, let's turn to greater China. While our full quarter results in Greater China were significantly impacted by COVID-19, it is worth providing some dimension. Our momentum in China continued to be extraordinary through mid-January. Our revenue growth was on track to exceed the expectations that we set 90 days ago, fueled by NIKE Digital. We launched the Nike app in China in Q3 and today we already have 5 million NIKE app downloads. And as John said, we're also seeing a spike in weekly average users on our activity apps as we inspire and enable consumers to engage in sport at home. We're now, as I said, through the recovery phase and into the normalization period in China. Today, our digital commerce growth continues to accelerate with triple-digit growth in demand just this last week. Most of our stores and our partner stores are open, retail traffic is significantly accelerating week-over-week, and we're beginning to see a decline from the peak inventory levels we experienced. We are confident that NIKE Greater China is on track to return to growth in fiscal year '21. As we look ahead, we will not be providing financial guidance for Q4, due to the uncertainty resulting from the spread of COVID-19. For fiscal year '21, we have been planning performance in line with our long-term financial model. The year-over-year growth rate base comparisons will no longer be meaningful. So, we'll share the approach that we're taking with respect to fiscal year '21 on our next earnings call. All of that said, we are confident that executing our operational plan will position NIKE for return to profitable capital efficient growth. That will happen over time, as each country addresses COVID-19 at a different pace. But, our confidence in the return to growth is founded on the relatively rapid recovery and early signs of normalization we are already seeing in China, Korea and Japan. In these challenging times, NIKE\u2019s competitive advantages are showing up as extraordinary resilience. As we emerge from these challenges, those same competitive advantages will show up as strength and brand distinction. Those unique strengths include NIKE\u2019s deep, authentic connection to consumers, our pipeline of innovative products, our financial strength and capacity, our industry-leading digital capabilities, our strong partnerships, and most importantly, our talented and committed teams around the world. I would not trade NIKE\u2019s team or position with anybody. With that, we'll now open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Bob Drbul : I just -- on the questioning for the -- I guess, it's on the inventory and the innovation pipeline. When you think about the halting of organizational, the sports and the Olympics and basketball, can you just talk us through how you're thinking about the pipeline, given the postponement of Olympics? You showed some really great product last month. I\u2019d just love to hear how you're approaching that piece of it. And then, the second piece of it is just can you elaborate a little more on how flexible your spending is, your demand creation that you sort of had planned for the next, let's call it, six months? John Donahoe : Sure. Bob, it\u2019s John. Why don't I take the first part of that question, maybe Andy take the second piece. So obviously, the world of organized sports, professional sports leagues, and now the Olympics have put things on hold. And they're doing, I think what's appropriate by prioritizing the health and safety of their athletes and fans, and we're very supportive of that. And we look forward to when organized sport will be back and running; and when they are, we\u2019ll be there. But, I think it's important to separate those sporting events and our innovation pipeline, because we will continue to move forward in our innovation pipeline. And as I said earlier, we're very excited about the products in that pipeline and the products introducing, in fact, more excited than perhaps any time before. And while we announced some of these products around the Olympics, if Olympics get deferred for a year, we can still launch them on our timing. So, two specific examples. As you know, the NEXT% performance running line will allow runners of all abilities to have the same technology and measurable benefits of the Alphafly NEXT% that the world's leading marathoners have. And we can launch that when the time is right, unrelated to the Olympics. Similarly, some of the sustainability products we announced at the forum, the VaporMax 2020, which utilizes 75% recycled manufacturing waste or the Space Hippie line, which is a innovative way to have low carbon footprint footwear, we can launch when the time is right, when we get to the recovering normalization periods. And so, consumer demand for those things is strong and will continue to be strong. And so, we simply are going to move ahead with our product pipeline at the right moments in the right ways. I'll just make one small final example before turning it over to Andy. In China, we got creative and we took a couple of launches that were scheduled in February and made them digital-only launches. So, the Air Jordan Retro High OG and the Air Jordan 5 Retro, we made digital-only launches in a world where stores are closed and -- but digital demand was strong. So, we're going to proceed full-speed ahead with that product pipeline. Andy, do you want to talk about the second part of the question? Andy Campion : Yes, just to summarize some of what both John and I said in remarks, and John just reiterated. We came into these circumstances in an incredibly strong position. Some of the highest full-price sell-through we've seen, inventories really healthy. As we go forward, we recognize that there will be some promotion in the marketplace. But as John said, we've also got an amazing pipeline of innovative and compelling fresh products. And what we'll be doing is working on the timing of the launch of those products and the flow of those products over time, so that while we're working through energy -- and working through inventory, we're also bringing distinctive energy to the market and to consumers. You asked about our licensed business. Just for context, our licensed business is a very-low single-digit percentage of our overall business. We'll have some impact on that business. I\u2019d say, just keep in mind that a lot of these elite sport activities or events are being postponed versus necessarily canceled, although some have been canceled. But one of the things we recognize around here is our product -- some of our products has a little bit longer life cycle. And, come fall, we think we could be kicking off one of the greatest years in sports history.  Now you also asked about SG&A. So, from an SG&A perspective, the short answer is, we've got quite a bit of flexibility within our SG&A. And that's one of the reasons you saw us deliver profitability, even in Q3, when we were all a bit taken off-guard by the significant impact of COVID-19. We were still able to deliver profitability that exceeded the guidance we set 90 days ago. As I also mentioned, based on some quick and agile work across our cross-functional teams, we see SG&A in Q4 declining versus prior year. There's quite a bit of flexibility in demand creation. And actually it ties back to your question about sport. As John mentioned in his remarks, we've done some really creative things from a digital connectivity perspective with huge impact. So, quick, low-cost, extraordinary impact and we think within demand creation we can save quite a bit of our powder for the return to a sport that we see within fiscal year \u201821. Within SG&A, our liquidity and our access to capital allows us within SG&A to stay very principled. So, continued pay continuity as John talked about and at the same time continuing to invest in those things that even now more than ever we see as differentiator long term, albeit we'll do it in a more focused way. So, beyond that, there are quite a bit of opportunities with the operating overhead and CapEx. And when I said our team has just been amazing in terms of their resilience and creativity, it actually includes in terms of tightly managing our costs. Bob Drbul : And I just have one quick follow-up. Andy, you mentioned the Infinity React helps runners run longer. I can run a pretty solid 11-minute a mile for 2 miles in my Epic React Flyknits. If I switch over to the Infinity Reacts, do you think I can get 3 10-minute miles out of those? Andy Campion : I think, we should sign up for the New York marathon. I'll come out there and run with you in November. How's that? Bob Drbul : Sounds like a plan. Good luck, guys. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question is from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Omar Saad : Welcome John. Congrats to all three of you on your new roles. Sorry. It's not on a more normal circumstances. John, given NIKE\u2019s leadership position in the global consumer landscape, I'd really appreciate, it\u2019s a little bit more detail on this kind of successful China, coronavirus playbook that you mentioned you're now rolling out to the rest of the world. You hinted that some of the successful digital strategies to connect to consumers when they're stuck at home. Feel free to add any more color there. Maybe could you also distinguish between the recovery you're seeing and the behavior you're seeing in stores versus that strong digital offset you mentioned. Do you expect this share that you seem to be capturing digitally to be sticky long-term? And then, maybe most importantly, could you also talk about whether you'd expect a similar sort of demand curve in other markets as coronavirus rolls through? Thanks. John Donahoe : Sure, Omar. So, one of the real advantages, as you said of NIKE being a scaled global companies, we can extract learning and insight from each of our markets. And so, here's what we've seen, just to quickly recap, what Andy and I talked about, we\u2019re looking at things through the lens of four phases to this, containment or the outbreak, first; second, recovery period when stores reopen; third, normalization, when things get back to growth from the prior year; and then fourth, return to growth. And the data from actually China, Japan and Korea was fairly consistent. Containment took five to six weeks, stores were closed, but the e-commerce growth in all three markets remained strong during that time, augmented by NIKE\u2019s connecting with consumers around being active while at home. Now, all three markets are through what we're calling recovery. That is retail's opening back up. Consumers are back on the streets. And we're seeing as we move into normalization, retail traffic is coming back. Consumers are in the stores. They're engaged who are often wearing face masks, but they're back on -- back on the street. Interestingly, digital has accelerated even more since the stores have been open. Again, I think pointing to this blended digital versus physical experience is a thing of the past. Consumers don't think in those terms. So, I bring a sort of consumer technology lens, where we learned that consumers want to get what they want, when they want, how they want it. And they don't think about, I'm going to make a digital purchase or a physical purchase. A consumer may often start shopping on their mobile device. They may go into a store and have it shipped at home, they may order online and pick it up in the store. And what we're seeing in Japan, China and Korea is that seamless digital physical experience is responding to what consumers want. And I might notice, our business comes back in those three markets, we\u2019re outperforming our competition, consistent with our mantra of ensuring that we come through this period in even stronger position and extend our leadership position. So, in the U.S., obviously, we're in much -- we're earlier in the cycle. We've closed the stores, we're taking care of our employees. We digitally connected with consumers over the weekend around health and their activity. So, our brand is present, day-in and day-out with them. As Andy mentioned, we're seeing very-strong digital growth, even in these dark days. And we're managing our inventory, so that we can be ready when target comes up.  We can't -- none of us can predict perfectly how long the containment phase is going to take in the U.S. and Europe. But, what we can know is when stores start reopening or while stores are closed, we're going to be there digitally. We're going to be there digitally with activity apps and commerce. And when the stores start reopening, we're going to be leveraging our strengths, our unique strengths with strong compelling product, a digital connection with consumers that is unmatched. The seamless digital and physical experiences at both Nike Direct and our partners are working very closely with our partners. In fact, in the last three days, I've talked to the CEOs of Zalando, JD, Foot Locker in the last couple of months, met with DICK's CEO, CEOs of our two Chinese partners. We're working together to be ready, when things recover and then our brands. So, I think it's going to accelerate what was already going to happen with digital transformation. Consumers will continue, digital's a more prominent role in their lives, you'll see more digital growth. And I think the shape of the future marketplace where differentiated retail thrives on differentiated retail struggles that will simply be accelerated. So we intend to drive both. Operator : Our next question is from Jamie Merriman with Bernstein. Jamie Merriman : John, just on two of the topics you just mentioned, and specifically how you're thinking about working with partners. Can you just comment on how you think about inventory in the wholesale channel as stores eventually reopen and maybe that by geography? And then, also on the topic of integration of online and offline, could you just update us on how those -- specifically those traditional physical partners are thinking about their own investments and working with you on some of the initiatives that you've put in place, like RFID? Thank you. John Donahoe : Jamie, I\u2019ll sort of blend it a little bit. And then, maybe, Andy, you can talk through, you\u2019ve been working actively with our partners over the last week on inventory. What I can tell you is what I said earlier is that our strategic partners who are our strongest partners and the one committed to creating seamless digital and physical experiences of the future. Our focus with them is on the future and coming back strong together and coming back in its healthier marketplace as possible. And so -- and we engage with them both around their physical stores and around online. In fact, I was on the phone this morning with the CEO of Zalando, who is obviously a very -- Zalando is a very innovative e-commerce company in Europe, and we are sharing data in very innovative ways around consumers, so that we can offer the best experiences to consumers in a differentiated way in the markets across Europe. And so, the conversations around the future, I think all of them see the same blended or seamless digital and physical experience together that we're committed to creating. And I think we all believe that this is kind of a common ear of differentiated retail versus undifferentiated and they see opportunity. We have to work through these challenging periods together, which we will, but I think all of them see the opportunity to emerge stronger and to accelerate the transformation of the marketplace. Andy, do you want to comment on the inventory specific conversation? Andy Campion : Yes. So, Jamie, what I\u2019d say is, while obviously there are some elements of these current circumstances that are unprecedented, we came into this circumstance with strategy. And our strategy was 2X Direct. That was a strategy that was not a NIKE-only strategy, it was really focused on driving more direct connections with our consumers, leveraging digital, both in our owned stores, online and with our partners and through their online presence. That's accelerating for everyone right now. So, if you think about the North American marketplace and Europe, with most stores closed both our owned stores and most of our retail partners, what it's really accelerating is that perspective and on the opportunities to connect with consumers digitally from a brand perspective but also expand our ability to connect with consumers from a product and service perspective. When we say partnership, it's not just transactional, it's not a back and forth transactional has a dialogue with our partners. We're talking to our partners about both, how we come through this period and then what we build for the long-term. And there are a couple of things that we're building. We're all expanding our digital pipe, so to speak. We in North America have already doubled the ability, the capacity to distribute product, one to one to consumers through our distribution centers in just several days. So, it's really accelerating what we saw is the future in terms of digital penetration. From an inventory perspective, right now digital is where the water is flowing, so to speak, or where the product is flowing. And so, we're working closely in partnership with folks like Zalando in Europe, as John mentioned. We already have an inventory partnership program with Zalando where we transact via their site and via their digital ecosystem and our digital ecosystem while leveraging each other's inventory. And we're working with our partners in the U.S. in a similar regard, managing the inventory they have on hand, the inventory we have on hand relative to them, and how best to flow that through their digital pipes as well as ours. So, I think in summary, what I'd say is, as John said, it's accelerating quite a bit of change in consumer behavior. It's also accelerating quite a bit of change in our partners\u2019 behavior. Operator : Our next question is from Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Alexandra Walvis : Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question -- good evening, rather. And thanks for taking the question. Just tremendous amount of color there and we really appreciate all of the insights. So, my question is on some comments related to gross margins. You mentioned rebates to wholesale partners and higher costs related to factory cancellations in your gross margin comments. I wanted to elaborate a little bit more on those. And would you expect those effects intensify as the issues related to demand reach more of the revenue base? John Donahoe : Sure. I'll take that question, Alexandra. I think, what we're finding is that there are several levers from the perspective of resetting inventory or supply as one might say relative to the pace of expansion and digital demand, the reopening of stores and then the amount of traffic going to those stores and the amount of conversion. And so, there isn't a sort of one size fits all or not just one lever. So, what we're doing with our own inventory and with our partners is we're looking at a lot of different levers. We're looking at realigning our product offer dates. So, not only do we have some inventory going into these circumstances, but we've got a great pipeline of product and we can move some of those product offer dates out to some extent as we work through this -- the inventory that we'll build over these weeks in which we're dealing with these circumstances in each market. We are primarily talking to our partners about managing inventory movement, the generation -- and the generation of cash flow with a view towards getting back to 14 to 16 weeks or so on hand in the market and 14 weeks or so on hand as inventory for NIKE and strong full-price sell-through. Some of the levers we'll employ in that regard will impact gross margin negatively. That's somewhat obvious. That could be promotion, it could be cancellation of orders. At the same time, none of those data points will represent a trend. So, what you're likely to see in the near term is a focus on supply and demand management that will impact revenue, may have a -- will have a negative impact on margin, but that is part and parcel goes with resetting that foundation for strong profitable growth. It's not a new trend, it's not a reflection of the strength of our product. In fact, John mentioned some of the launches we've had in China. We've actually had some product launches here in the U.S. over the last couple of weeks that have sold through at full price. So, it'll be a blend of working through inventory, which does have some impact on margin and a blend of bringing innovation and fresh, compelling new product to consumers. We probably would be looking for energy and inspiration and optimism. Operator : Our last question is from Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Matthew Boss : Great, thanks. So, maybe on North America, your 7% adjusted underlying constant currency growth I think translates to a mid-teens, two-year stack. Maybe can you speak to what's driving the domestic inflection? Andy, maybe pre-COVID, a little bit of insight, how you were thinking about the North American marketplace over the next 12 months? And just larger picture on the curve where we stand today on the move to differentiated retail? John Donahoe : Matthew, maybe I'll just make a comment or two and then Andy, you can flush out. But, I\u2019ve spent time now in several of our markets across the U.S. And I've seen firsthand how NIKE\u2019s key city strategy is paying off. Andy mentioned the growth in New York, growth in LA being double-digit. And that is because both with NIKE Direct, and with our partners, we're getting closer to the consumer. Now, I'll just take a couple examples. I had a chance to visit the Foot Locker, very innovative store in Washington Heights neighborhood in New York where the entire display of the inventory and the merchandise and the whole focus is being of the neighborhood. And you can just see consumers responding. And that store is experiencing significantly greater growth than other comparable stores that Foot Locker has in the area. So, it's a great example of differentiated retail and the future of retail. We're doing the same with some Latino communities in LA, providing retail concepts both through NIKE Direct and with our partners that are getting close to what consumers want in those markets and give them more personalized feel. And when you wrap that around with a digital connection with membership, and the other digital tools, you can feel the energy and momentum. And so, I think at its core, this key city strategy that NIKE\u2019s put in place in the U.S. and beyond, is absolutely paying dividends. Andy Campion : Yes. I'll just add, Matthew that there are few really important drivers to highlight. I appreciate you recognizing that growth has been consistently strong in North America. And obviously, one of the things I should say is we are entering these challenging times in a position of strength. And as John said, strong brands get stronger during these times. So, we think we\u2019ll emerge even stronger. For a little bit of context on the strength we had entering this fourth quarter, NIKE Digital continues to fuel strong growth in North America of a relatively extraordinary 33% in the quarter. We've talked to you about the significant opportunity that we think in terms of the Women's Business. Our Women's Business grew at a rate that was nearly doubled out of men's both in footwear and apparel. So, we're seeing strong growth there. Now, across footwear and apparel, our growth was relatively balanced, both in the mid-single-digit, and that's even taking into account the divestiture of Hurley, which was a largely apparel business and the shift in our business model with respect to the NFL, which is also largely an apparel business. So, what you can infer from that is we've told you we think we have an epic growth opportunity in digital in women's and in apparel. And when you take into account those non-comparables in the quarter, all three, including apparel are over-indexing, in terms of growth. So, again, we feel great about the position of strength we had and have from a brand perspective as we work through these challenges. And we'll be doing everything we can in terms of managing demand and supply and fueling our brand, so that we emerge even stronger. Matthew Boss : Great call. Congrats on the progress and best of luck. John Donahoe : Thank you. And thank you, Matt, for your last call. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with you all next quarter. Take care, stay healthy and stay safe and be safe everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this conclude today's call.

In the event you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue, and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I will now turn the call over to Nike, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe. John Donahoe : Thank you, Andy, and let me congratulate you on your new role leading Investor Relations. I also want to congratulate Matt on becoming our CFO and express how deeply confident I am in Nike's financial management under Matt's leadership. Before I get into our Q4 performance, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the environment in the U.S. right now. Over the past month, we've seen racial tragedies expose systemic prejudice and injustice in America. And Nike has a long history of standing up against inequality, driven by our values and rooted in the power of sport. Today, we are uniting behind our black athletes, teammates and community as Nike continues to lead with purpose. And we're taking action to help create lasting change to address systemic racism in our society, including a combined $140 million commitment from Nike, Converse, the Jordan Brand and Michael Jordan. And while we continue to lead externally, we also strive to be even better internally to meet the high bar we set for ourselves to be a truly diverse and inclusive company. We're also continuing to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a profound impact on the lives of so many across the globe. And throughout all of this, we have led with our values. We have executed with empathy and decisiveness. We prioritized the health and safety of our teammates by closing stores, offices and other facilities. We committed to provide pay continuity for all of our teammates, even while our facilities remain closed or had altered schedules. And we have maintained this important investment over the past 12 weeks. Our innovation teams designed and delivered personal protective equipment to health systems across the country. We donated footwear and apparel to help frontline workers around the globe. And we've committed more than $25 million for COVID-19 response in our communities. I must say that I've been so impressed and inspired by how our Nike teammates around the world have come together and responded to this crisis. They have moved with speed and empathy and have demonstrated creativity, courage and true resilience. I could not be more proud of everyone on the Nike team. As we look back on this quarter, it demonstrated once again that Nike's competitive advantage is driven by our team and by our brands ability to connect with consumers. And this is fueled by our strategy, the Consumer Direct Offense, and that's why I continue to believe no one is better positioned than Nike to navigate the current environment. Now, Matt will go deeper on Q4 in a minute, [indiscernible] on five quick observations from the quarter. First, the power of Nike's brand continues, leading with our values is drawing us closer to consumers. We use our ecosystem of Nike activity and commerce apps to directly engage with consumers in their homes as they focus on health and wellness. During this difficult time, Nike has inspired and offered hope. And as a result, worldwide affinity for our brand deepened during COVID-19. With our \"You Can't Stop Us\" campaign receiving more than 2 billion impressions to-date. Across all 12 of our key cities, Nike remains consumers' number one favorite brand. Second, Greater China has returned to currency neutral growth. Over the quarter we strengthened our consumer connections and translated them into meaningful relationships. For example, in March and April, China's monthly active users on the Nike training app increased over 350% since the beginning of the calendar year, this direct engagement with consumers allowed our business in China to return to growth in Q4. Third, we're seeing a true step function change in our digital transformation. As you know, this has been an area of investment over the past few years as we build our digital advantage but COVID-19 has accelerated the pace. In Q4, Nike digital grew 79% and we surpassed $1 billion in annual digital revenue in both Greater China and EMEA for the first time. We've seen this strong digital momentum continue throughout the quarter and into early June, even as stores have begun to reopen. Looking at our app ecosystem in Q4 a couple of stats jump out as we see an extraordinary leap in digital demand and engagement. Workouts on the Nike training club app more than tripled, peaking in April at nearly 5 million workouts per week during the month. Since February, the Nike commerce app has been downloaded more than 8 million times and increased its triple last year's level, proving the power of our investment in digital. And in fiscal year '20, sneakers reached an impressive milestone reaching $1 billion in global demand for the first time. Fourth observation on the quarter, the Jordan Brand resonated deeply in Q4, with the airing of ESPN, The Last Dance documentary. The response we saw from the cultural conversation around each episode to the rapid sell through the AJ 5 Fire Red demonstrated the love for the Jordan Brand all over the world. In fact, the Jordan Brand in Greater China grew more than 50% in fiscal year '20 approaching a $1 billion in annual revenue. And women's has played a key role in Jordan's growth. And we see significant opportunity for Jordan to achieve even greater scale as we create more products for women, expand lifestyle offerings and grow the business internationally. And even during the pandemic, Jordan drove some of the quarter's biggest launches, including the AJ 1 and AJ 13, a reminder of the continued strength of our consumer demand. Fifth and finally, innovation continues to be Nike's greatest competitive advantage. We continuously bring fresh new product to market supported by compelling storytelling that helps drive consumer demand. In Q4, we saw strong demand for the Pegasus 37 particularly with women and for the Air Max 2090, a new sportswear silhouette that reimagines the future of Air. We also launched space Hippie in our international geographies during June with early success, offering even more proof of global consumer appetite for sustainable product. And our unmatched investment in product innovation even during a pandemic, will be proven with our most sustainable product ever, the VaporMax 2020 launching in July. As I said earlier, Nike is in a position to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic even stronger due to our Consumer Direct Offense. The global pandemic has made it clear that consumer behavior is changing rapidly providing the opportunity for us to accelerate the pace of our transformation. Over the past few years, we have shifted from a legacy wholesale distribution model to investment in a model that gives our consumers a more premium shopping experience. And this is a change that has catalyzed our digital growth as part of our true Consumer Direct Offense. And COVID-19 has shown that our strategy is sound. And so as we look to the future, here is what is not going to change. Our purpose will continue to guide us, the power of sports will always be at our center and product innovation will continue to drive distinction for our brand. With these strengths in mind, we plan to accelerate our focus and investments on the key areas to put an even sharper point on our highest growth opportunities. So today, we're announcing a new digitally empowered phase of our Consumer Direct strategy to Consumer Direct acceleration. We aren't settling for our current leadership position with consumers or in digital, we're pursuing even further separation. We're transforming Nike faster to define the marketplace of the future. Now is the time to act. Let me walk you through three areas of strategic acceleration, the marketplace of the future, our new consumer construct and our end to end technology foundation. First, we will create a marketplace of the future when more closely aligned with what consumers want need. Digital has redefined the industry over the past several years and Nike has led that change. You were called it in fiscal year '18, we set a goal to reach 30% Digital penetration, both owned and partnered by fiscal year '23. We will reach that goal more than two years ahead of plan this coming year. And looking ahead, we now expect our overall business to reach 50% digital penetration. As we look at opportunities to build deeper and more meaningful relationships with consumers, our vision is to create a clear and connected digital marketplace to match. Consumers want modern, seamless experiences, online to offline. So we're accelerating our approach. Our OneNike marketplace strategy leads with Nike digital in our own stores and embraces a small number of strategic partners who share our vision to provide a consistent premium shopping experience. Connected data, inventory and membership will give consumers greater access to the best of Nike with more speed and convenience than ever. We've talked about membership as a growth driver and differentiator before but now will align our business to make it central to everything we do. And as part of the strategy, we will also scale our investments in smaller format digitally enabled mono brand stores with integrated online to offline capabilities. We believe this will be additive to what's in the market. These mono brand stores will accelerate the growth trajectory of Nike's largest market share opportunities, like women's and apparel, driving long-term profitability. Our second area of acceleration under Consumer Direct acceleration, Nike will operate under a new simpler consumer construct. We know that our consumers don't see themselves as only runners or yoga practitioners. They don't think in terms of performance versus sportswear. Instead, we know how they shop across men's, women's and kids. And so we'll realign the company to reflect a simplified men's, women's and kids approach. Our category focus will be more specialized across this consumer construct. Importantly, this consumer construct will allow us to significantly simplify our organization and focus more of our resources on the capabilities and opportunities that will forge our future, in particular, will be reinvesting in our women's and kids businesses. These intentional organizational focuses will touch every area of our business, including innovation, product creation, marketing, merchandising and distribution. Through this new consumer construct, we can serve performance sport with more specificity, while also broadening the definition of sport. This approach allows us to better focus on the individual consumer and unlock new opportunities to more nimbly serve their exact needs. And third, and finally, we will invest in digital capabilities in our end-to-end technology foundation to accelerate our transformation. Simply put, we will more aggressively leverage technology to make Nike better. This single integrated technology strategy across our business will accelerate how we serve consumers. Specifically, we'll speed up the unifier investments across demand sensing, insight gathering, inventory, management and more. This simplified approach will unlock more efficiency for the business, while driving speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally. Consumer direct acceleration is more than just the next phase of our strategy. It's the spark that will ignite and empower our entire company to serve consumers, our business and our teams better. As we shift our operating model to fuel this strategy, Nike's leadership position will become even stronger in the future as sports continues to resonate with consumers amid a global shift toward health and wellness. In the end, over the past few months, we have navigated unprecedented conditions. But our purposeful actions will allow us to emerge from its stronger and better than ever before. The strength of our brand, our deep connections to consumers and our unmatched product innovation give us an advantage to create and define our future fueled by the consumer direct acceleration, Nike will shape the marketplace and extend our brand leadership for years to come. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt. Matt Friend : Thank you, John, and hello to everyone on the call. I also want to take a moment to welcome Andy Muir to her first call that she expands her responsibilities and provides leadership over Investor Relations. Before discussing our fourth quarter results, I must recognize and thank our incredible team around the world. I have personally been inspired to watch everyone come together to face our current challenges, embracing new ways of working, and decisively taking actions to serve our consumers in the face of unprecedented conditions. I could not be prouder to be a part of this team. This quarter was certainly like no other in Nike's history. As John mentioned, to protect the safety of our employees and to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, 90% of our own stores outside of Greater China and South Korea were closed from operation for roughly eight weeks in the quarter. Similarly, our wholesale partners largely followed the same pattern and the sale of product through physical retail channels came to a halt. Digital quickly became the primary channel that we could engage with and serve consumer demand, and Nike was well positioned to respond. We accelerated growth of our digital business to 79% on a currency neutral basis and drove nearly triple digit acceleration in member digital demand. All told Nike digital represented nearly 30% of our total business in the fourth quarter, and reached $5.5 billion for the full year. The net result of these two marketplace dynamics was that Nike, Inc. Q4 revenue declined 38% on a reported basis. And yet, even in the midst of this global pandemic, we saw the power and distinction of the Nike brand translate into growing business momentum throughout the quarter continuing into June. Greater China returned to growth in Q4 and Nike digital also accelerated growth each month in the quarter, including triple digit growth globally in May even as physical retail reopened. These trends have sustained through the first three weeks of June. And in some markets digital growth has accelerated even further. We believe this digital acceleration is more indicative of a strategic shift towards a new future marketplace, rather than being a reflection of temporary challenges to the mostly physical marketplace of the past. Now as we look ahead to fiscal year '21, three key themes standout from a financial and operational perspective, Nike supply and demand management, Nike's financial strength and Nike's digital acceleration. Let me take a few minutes to unpack each of these. First, at the end of q4, inventory increased 31% versus prior year. In mid-March, we immediately went into action to rebuild our plans to recalibrate marketplace supply and demand around the world. As we have said before, supply and demand management is critical to sustaining a healthy premium brand. And over the past three years, we have enhanced our capabilities to manage through situations like this. Let me share a few specifics regarding what we have already done. First, we modified our near-term inventory buying plans and proactively cancelled pre-COVID-19 factory purchase orders for the fallen holiday seasons by roughly 30% on a unit basis. And while this had a negative impact on gross margins in Q4, it was the right decision to tighten future inventory movement through our supply chain and utilize the inventory we have on hand. Second, we implemented a plan for a seasonless flow of inventory by shifting product to offer dates, so we can use relevant summer and fall product to meet near-term demand. We also edited product lines by up to 15% to improve SKU productivity. Third, we quickly shifted available inventory to digital and we increased digital fulfillment capacity by more than 3x in North America and EMEA. And finally, we've invested in targeted promotions and markdowns to accelerate the liquidation of excess inventory. While we protect the long-term health of our product franchises, including increasing the volume of liquidation through our factory store fleet. In Greater China, this playbook has worked and we expect our business will return to normalized marketplace health metrics by the end of June. In fact, we are already seeing inventory levels globally improve as well and with our deliberate actions, we are confident that Nike inventory will be right sized and in a normal position in Q2. This leads me to the second theme. Nike's financial strength enabled us to stay focused on the long-term, creating even greater competitive advantage in times of dislocation. In an environment where most companies are solely focused on survival, Nike's financial strength, scale and adaptability allows us to make appropriate near-term decisions, while investing to fuel long-term growth. We finished the quarter with $12.5 billion in total available liquidity, including nearly $9 billion of cash and short-term investments all supported by a strong investment grade credit rating and a high return on invested capital. We continue to operate from a position of strength and I would not trade our position with anyone. Our current focus is to reduce discretionary spending, while we invest in the digital capabilities necessary to further our competitive advantage in the marketplace. This includes improving the user experience on our digital platforms through enhanced digital commerce analytics, marketing technology for better consumer targeting and segmentation, online to offline marketplace capabilities, and enhanced inventory pricing and supply management tools. We will continue to increase the scale and efficiency of our digital fulfillment capabilities. In Q4, we already pivoted our new adaptive distribution facility in North America to fully support digital demand. And we plan to open a new regional service center on the West Coast before the holiday season to forward deployed digital inventory, leveraging advanced analytics and demand sensing capabilities from our acquisition of Celect. Simply put, we have operating principals in place to prudently manage costs in the short-term, while we scale investment in key capabilities underpinning our digital transformation. We will continue to do this while managing SG&A tightly in the first half of fiscal year '21. And last, a more digitally connected Nike is a more valuable Nike. The underlying value proposition of Nike's Consumer Direct Offense is that the consumer adoption of digital across all aspects of life now provides Nike with an opportunity to create deeper, more direct to consumer relationships at scale without disintermediation. As we've said before, the transformation to a more digital and direct business is financially accretive to Nike. Our business results over the last seven quarters pre-COVID-19 proved this point. As compared to our long-term financial model, Nike has driven hire constant dollar revenue growth, and roughly doubled the annual gross margin expansion on an operational basis, excluding the impacts of foreign exchange headwinds and tariffs. The current economics of this transformational shift illustrates my point. On average, a sale of an incremental unit via digital generates double the revenue versus a sale to wholesale, with a higher gross margin, translating into 2x the operating income dollars. And so to reiterate what John said and why this is so important, we now see that our owned and partner digital could grow to 50% of our total business in the foreseeable future. Plus our measured investment in mono brand stores will further catalyze digital growth and create new distribution for our largest growth and market share opportunities in women's and apparel. We are calling this next phase of the Consumer Direct Offense an acceleration for a reason because it will drive greater growth, it will scale Nike's direct consumer connections in our most profitable channels driving higher consumer lifetime value, and it will enable us to reposition our resources to accelerate our transformation to a digital first company. Now let's turn to the details of our fourth quarter financial results and operating segment performance. Nike, Inc. Q4 revenue declined 38% down 36% on a currency neutral basis, reflecting the impact of Nike owned store closures and lower wholesale shipments partially offset by growth in Nike digital. Gross margin decreased 820 basis points in Q4 as higher full price average selling prices despite increased wholesale discounts were more than offset by higher product costs, including factory cancellation charges and increased inventory obsolescence reserves as well as the adverse rate impact of supply chain fixed costs on lower wholesale shipments due to COVID-19 dynamics. SG&A declined 6% in Q4. We reduced costs through clear enterprise wide cost management principles, including reduction of marketing spending, due to the cancellation of live sporting events and retail store closures. It's important to note that the decline in SG&A in the quarter included a roughly $180 million charge related to bad debt reserves. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 1.7% compared to 20.4% for the same period last year, due to the mix of earnings tax in the U.S., and favorability attributable to the use of foreign tax credits. Fourth quarter diluted net loss per share was $0.51, reflecting lower revenue and gross margin related to COVID-19 partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. And full year diluted EPS was $1.60 which includes a one time non-cash charge associated with the anticipated strategic distributor partnership transition in South America, which reduced EPS by $0.25. With that, let's turn to our reported operating segments. Last quarter, we discussed how each of our markets would progress from a business perspective as they emerge from the COVID-19 outbreak. First, a recovery period including the ramp up of store reopenings; second, a period of normalization of supply and demand; and third, a period in which we returned to growth. In Q4, Greater China and South Korea returned to growth. North America, EMEA and the remainder of APLA are still in the recovery period, as stores began to reopen throughout May and early June. In North America, Q4 revenue declined 46% on a currency neutral basis. However, Nike digital grew 80% and the Nike app grew triple digits and now represents 30% of our North America digital business. Women's full price apparel grew 200% and was powered by strong new member growth, with women representing over half of new member acquisition in the quarter. As retail began to reopen in mid May, we saw a strong double-digit growth in retail sales for our brand across the total North America marketplace. These trends have continued into early June, including Nike digital growing triple digits. Physical retail traffic remains below prior year and is being offset by higher rates of conversion due to promotional activity, as well as significant shifts to owned and partnered digital. And as of today, approximately 85% of Nike owned stores are open. In EMEA, Q4 revenue declined 44% on a currency neutral basis, digital grew nearly 100% with continued brand momentum and significant new member acquisition and engagement across the Nike training club and the Nike running club apps with active new member growth of over 200% and more than 18 million workouts logged in the quarter. And Nike gained market share across both footwear and apparel, becoming the number one apparel brand during Q4 in key markets for the first time. As retail began to reopen in May, we saw a slight growth in total retail sales versus the prior year across the marketplace, with better performance in Germany, France and the U.K. offset by slower recovery in Spain and Italy. Retail sales have now accelerated in June, including triple-digit Nike digital growth. Traffic levels, conversion trends, and consumer shifts towards digital are similar to what we are seeing in North America. And as of today, approximately 90% of Nike owned stores are open. With that, let's turn to Greater China, where we returned to growth of 1% on a currency neutral basis, and the sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. Growth improved each month of the quarter, including strong double-digit growth in May on a currency neutral basis. Digital grew 53% outpacing the industry and the Nike app, which launched in Q3 is already resonating with consumers with nearly 11 million downloads, driving over 10% of total digital demand in the fourth quarter. As of today, 100% of Nike owned stores are open. In June, we have seen a return to positive comparable store sales in Nike owned stores with higher conversion and higher units per transaction more than offsetting lower traffic. Nike digital growth has accelerated to triple digits. Finally, in our APLA geography, Q4 revenue declined 39% on a currency neutral basis. We saw varied COVID-19 impact across countries in the region, with South Korea emerging the fastest, delivering 8% growth in the quarter. And digital growth was nearly 80% led by strength in Japan, Korea and Brazil, with women's growing 2x the rate of men's on Nike digital. As of today, approximately 65% of Nike owned stores are open, with a higher percentage in South Korea, Japan and Australia, while stores across Latin America remain largely closed due to efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. Fiscal year '21 will continue to be a time of uncertainty as economies rebound from the effects of COVID-19 and seek to contain further outbreaks of the disease. We will be agile and resilient, because we understand that each market recovery will not be linear. We remain focused on what we can control so that Nike can manage risk and aggressively attack opportunities created in this environment. Given the uncertainty that still remains, we will not be providing specific guidance. Today, however, I will share the approach we are taking to fiscal year '21 planning. In general, we expect to see sequential quarterly improvement in our financial results as retail reopens and each market normalizes supply and demand. We expect revenue in the first half of the year to be below prior year levels, but less of a decline than experienced in Q4, as we continue to reopen stores and fuel our digital business. We expect revenue in the second half to be up significantly versus the prior year with a healthy marketplace and normalizing full price sell through across our channels. For the full fiscal year, we expect revenue to be flat to up versus prior year. And of course, we will have greater clarity on our full year outlook 90 days from now. Gross Margin will continue in the short-term to be a function of our supply and demand management actions as we prioritize the return to normalize inventory levels in Q2. As I said earlier, we have tightened our buys in the first half and are focused on moving through the inventory we have as profitably as we can. We expect SG&A to decline versus the prior year. The financial and operating principles that will carry us through these unprecedented times are the same ones that have guided us over the decades, and our brand momentum and deep consumer connections, our differentiated product and continuous flow of innovation, our digital advantage, and our operational capabilities have never been stronger. In addition, consumer interest in sport, fitness, health and wellness has never been greater, leaving Nike's market opportunity larger than ever. And though we can't predict short-term trends due to the dynamic nature of this pandemic, interestingly enough, we can now see our brand's long-term future even more clearly. With that, we will now open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alexandra Walvis : Good evening. Thanks so much for taking my question here. And thank you for all the comments in the prepared remarks; very interesting on the longer term outlook for the business. I wanted to dig a little bit more into the consumer direct acceleration that's hit out in your remarks there. Can you talk about the plans for new stores? Do you have any color on the number of new stores that you're planning to roll out? And can you talk about, what is being planned for the wholesale business perhaps in terms of points of distribution, or partners that you're targeting over time? John Donahoe : Sure, Alexandra. In a funny way, I would characterize this investment in these new doors as a continued investment in our digital future. And we look at everything through the eyes of the consumer. And consumers as you know are becoming accustomed to getting what they want, when they want it, how they want it, right? And this pandemic is really demonstrates a shift toward digital being at the center of everything they do. But they want modern and seamless experiences. They don't necessarily just want to buy digitally and have it shipped from home, you're seeing during the pandemic and we believe it will continue. They want to buy it on their digital device and go pick it up in the store, or with soft goods like apparel, they may want to reserve it online and try it on in the store. They may want to be in a store and buy something that is not in the store because of inventory. And the associate uses a digital device to buy it and get shipped home. And so consumers increasingly want a consistent, seamless physical and digital experience. And so that's what we're committed to providing and we're committed to providing those through; first and foremost, our own digital capabilities, as well as our own digital stores, both factory or I'm sorry, own physical stores factory and direct. A very important piece of this is our strategic partners, our strategic wholesale partners we envision having fewer of them, but focusing on those that will share our vision of providing a seamless experience a consist seamless experience with physical points of presence. And then we think there's an incremental opportunity in the market and a need to provide a mono brand experience, particularly around women's and apparel. We have actually seen this firsthand in China. As you know, in China with a relatively modest investment, there are mono brand stores that dramatically upscale how we serve consumers. I've had a chance to see this firsthand. During my first weeks at Nike in China, [indiscernible] long for to get back out on the road, get back out in the markets, get back out with consumers. That's coming again, I know. But I got to see firsthand the power of those mono brand stores. And so we'll be opening somewhere between 150 and 200 new stores, there'll be small footprint, digitally enabled mono brand stores in North America and EMEA. We have been testing this format with Nike Life and have a great understanding of how to best deliver this experience. And so we will proceed ahead this year with more tests and learn examples of it and scale it through the next couple of years. And again, to be clear, we believe this is incremental to what's in the market today. It's complimentary to what we are already doing and our partners are doing. And at the end of the day, we believe that Nike owned physical and digital working hand in hand with our key partners online and offline, we can create OneNike marketplace that meet the demand of consumers now and in the future. Matt Friend : And I might just jump in Alex and say that, as John mentioned, we've been testing the Nike Life concept. We started in Melrose in Southern California. We've opened a store in Long Beach and in Glendale. We've also been testing the concept in Shibuya in Tokyo. And in the first half of the year, we intend to ship to Nike owned doors in New York to the Life concept. And as we've continued to test the concept, we've been testing the assortment, we've been testing member engagement, we're seeing that members engage more frequently. It's serving to help us retain members. And so as John mentioned, this is why we see this as being a catalyst to digital growth having local stores that members can engage with. John Donahoe : That Tokyo store inventory driven by consumer demand, digital demand is constantly changing based on what's moving. So it's a great example of a digitally connected future. Operator : Our next question is from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Omar Saad : Thanks for taking my question. I'd be interested to hear you talk more in a category offense has such a strong initiative at the company for many years. I'd love to hear you talking more about the shift to men's, women's, kids. How does category offense fit into that maybe a little bit more behind the impetus behind that. And what's the end result here is that higher revenue growth, better margins, more dynamic product lines. Thanks. John Donahoe : Omar, the first thing I'd say is the category offense is working, right? And triple double makes complete sense and our growth drivers are spot-on. And they were working, frankly, when we came into the pandemic. And the pandemic, in many ways was a stress test for them. And it really proved that our current strategy is working. So what we're talking about here is how do we take -- how do we take what might have taken us three to five years to make it happen in two. And we think there is some pretty fundamental shifts in consumer behavior that give us this opportunity to accelerate our progress. One shift is digital, right? As I said a minute ago, digital is now fundamental and central to everything consumers do. And we are the clear leader in digital, we'll double down on that. The second I just talked about was the marketplace of the future, right, where we believe we can drive for OneNike marketplace with our own capabilities and those of our partners. But third, and directly your question is, aligning our organization against, A) a more simple construct of men's, women's and kids, but also ones that help us unlock what we think are great growth opportunities, right? Women's apparel, kids and frankly, the emerging health and wellness of the opportunity. So this is not to be crystal clear not abandoning the consumer direct offense. This is accelerating it and refining it so that we're more directly connected to the biggest opportunities. Like women's, great example women's, we have less than 10% of the women's apparel market in the U.S. Women's grew this quarter, two times the rate of men. And this will allow us to align our organization and focus our resources more directly on that opportunity, as well as on others. And so we view it as an acceleration and I think will result in more directly connecting and building deep consumer relationships which will result in higher growth market share. And as Matt said in his remarks, we believe also, this is also healthy for profitability. Matt Friend : Yes. And Omar, I would just add to the category offenses has enabled us to sharpen our focus on performance sport and the lifestyle of sport. And this shift is going to enable us to specialize and get deeper insights to the performance category. And the lifestyle sport categories through the gender lens. And so if you think about it from innovation to the way we create products or the way we bring it to market, we believe that this is an opportunity to move from insight to innovation and creating products specifically for the consumer, and ensuring that we did it to market the way that we intended, when we captured the insight and created the product, which we believe will accelerate growth against these big long-term opportunities. Operator : Our next question is from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Erinn Murphy : I guess on new customer acquisition you talked about real strength in the quarter. I guess if you look across the suite of apps in your own dot-com. Where did you see the highest uptick of new customers, if each of you can share a little bit more about what you saw from that as well? And then, how has that shaped your growth strategies around your app and just your broader digital ecosystem? John Donahoe : Erinn, this gets to membership and why we think membership is at the center of everything we do. And if you think about it, in simple terms, membership is a big word but in my mind it breaks down three simple things. Do we have a one-on-one relationship, an identified one-on-one relationship with a consumer? Can we increase our level of engagement with that consumer in value-added ways? And then, does that increased engagement lead to greater retention and share of wallet if there are other purchases? And in terms of acquiring new members in a quarter we had a phenomenal quarter, 25 million new members registered that's up over 100%. Half those came from our activity apps and half the new members were women, which is a very encouraging sign. And then, those new members and our existing members were highly engaged, particularly around Nike Training Club, Nike Running Club, our Sneakers App. The stats are just -- I think I listed a few of my remarks and Matt did, but NTC weekly active users which is a really important metric, because someone may only buy footwear and apparel a few times a year, but engaging with us each week maybe even each day brings Nike into their lives and so we grew weekly active users triple digits in the quarter, 25 million workouts with women alone in Q4 and that which is -- and so we think the activity levels and the engagement's growing. And then it's really clear that increased engagement leads to increased purchases. And so the Nike commerce app saw triple-digit growth in both downloads and monthly active buyers, as well as the Sneakers app over $1 billion in first time use. And so directly connecting with consumers, engaging them with our powerful portfolio of activity apps, and then translating that into the kind of both digital and online and offline relationships where they purchase more is kind of core to the strategy that the OneNike marketplace, if you will, is designed to address that direct need. Operator : Your next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Matthew Boss : So maybe as we think about the acceleration of the Consumer Direct strategy that you outlined, how best larger picture to think about the impact on gross margin annually, as we think about 50 basis points a year prior. SG&A, I think the prior target was slight leverage multiyear or maybe just said differently, is there any constraints hindering this overall acceleration being a relative acceleration of your mid-teens bottom-line annual algorithm? Matt Friend : Well, Matt, the way I would answer your question is that our long-term financial model has always been principled. And it starts with creating value for the consumer which then translates into creating business value and ultimately value for the shareholders and our focus is on creating sustainable profitable long-term growth. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the shift to digital is financially accretive to Nike, and we believe that this will be an enabler for us to sustain that momentum longer term. In the near-term or in any given period, obviously, we deal with foreign currency, we deal with anomalies that can have an impact on an interim period, but we're very confident in how this strategy will enable us to sustain that growth long-term. What I would tell you because you asked the question about investment. We've been this quarter in particular was indicative of an opportunity for us where we managed SG&A very tightly but we actually accelerated investment the way we needed to, to enable our employees to work-from-home, to enable digital demand, to do the things that we needed to do in order to be able to accommodate the environment in which we're operating. And as we look to the future while we will accelerate investment against the areas that I referenced, we also see equal opportunity for us to shift resources that sit in our P&L in legacy forms which we can redeploy against the future, and so that's going to be our focus as we look toward the future. We will be investing but we're going to accommodate it within the confines of our existing financial model. Operator : Your next question is from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Your line is open. Bob Drbul : I guess I have a couple of questions on the inventory and I think the plan to sort of have it right-sized by the second quarter. Can you just talk through the major strategy that you have, the flexibility that you have to sort of utilize your outlets versus off-price versus the digital piece of it? Just walk us through some of the major initiatives in terms of getting back there on the supply and demand piece of this, please? Matt Friend : Sure, Bob. As you know, Nike has always tried to carefully manage supply and demand, and as a premium brand, we maintain our premium nature because we try to optimize a full-price marketplace across our channels season after season after season. And so when the pandemic hit it became clear that there was going to be excess inventory for a period of time. And we pulled many of the levers that we have at our disposal in order to be aggressive in addressing this issue. And in particular, we said our first and primary principle was to get inventory clean in the marketplace as fast as we possibly can. And so we now feel confident based upon the actions that we've taken that we will have inventory right-sized and clean by Q2 or in Q2. And in China, as I referenced, given they faced the pandemic a little bit earlier, they're going to clear and come out of the situation from an inventory perspective by the end of June. And so we feel very good about the actions that we've taken. To your point, the marketplace is more promotional. We have shifted more units of liquidation through our factory store fleet because that's a brand-right way for us to liquidate our inventory at a higher profitability level. But, we are also seeing some discounting that's happening across the marketplace but our discounting is less than what we're seeing across the broader marketplace, and our strong brand and our consumer connection is causing us to liquidate and move through inventory faster than what we are seeing across the rest of the marketplace. And so through the first three weeks of June as I referenced, we feel like we're on track against this plan or we are on track against this plan and are confident that we're going to be positioned for the consumer and for the market in the second half of the year. Bob Drbul : Great. And I guess just a quick follow up is, with the NBA season sort of looking to return, any early picks in terms of who you guys think will win the title in the back half? John Donahoe : Bob, we are so happy that basketball is going to be back. We just want someone wearing a Nike uniform to win. We feel pretty good about that prediction. Operator : Your next question is from Jay Sole with UBS. Your line is open. Jay Sole : Matt, you talked about the shift of inventories to direct consumer and increase the digital capacity 3x to meet the demand to digital. Could you just talk a little bit more about that like what that means and going forward is there any constraints that will from a capacity perspective that will slow the company's growth to you getting the ecommerce to be 50% of the total business going forward? Matt Friend : Sure, Jay. So I'm incredibly proud of our teams that work in our global operation and logistics because they delivered no small feat in the quarter, increasing the amount of volume that we could ship by 3x in North America and EMEA without much of an increase in cost on a per-unit basis. And the reason why they could do that is because our current distribution capabilities are omni-channel, which means we can ship to wholesale customers, our factory stores and to digital and that enabled us to be agile in the moment to increase our digital demand fulfillment. As we look forward, I mentioned that we're going to be investing in a new facility on the West Coast of the U.S. in order to be able to fulfill demand through holiday. And we expect that we will continue to invest in regional service centers in order to be able to fulfill demand closer to the consumer. But we've also enabled buy online pick up in-store and ship-from-store from our stores which will also be a way that we fulfill demand closer to the consumer. So I guess a long way of saying that we feel confident that we can continue to meet this digital demand and our team continues to be able to expand capacity without it compromising our cost per-unit. In fact, they continue to do what they can to mitigate cost per-unit and we believe it's a long-term opportunity for us as well. John Donahoe : And I may just to add a little bit of color on that. The week before last, I had a chance to go out and visit our teams in Memphis along with Andy Campion. By the way, Andy's not on the earnings call any more, but he's working full-time as our COO on just what Matt was talking about, doing a great job. And Andy, Venky and I went out and saw our teams in Memphis and got to see this adapt facility that Matt talked about. It was initially constructed to serve wholesale, but has now been completely redeployed to serve direct-to-consumer. And I think, Matt, you referenced the power of data, right, the power of that Celect acquisition where advanced analytics and demand sensing capabilities can allow us to get the right product as close to the consumer in the right time which offers enormous efficiency opportunities, right? And by the way, that's a scale gain and that's going to allow us to build scale that others won't be able to match and we want to share that scale with our wholesale partners and others as we embrace this. And so it was really great to see that team and they've done a phenomenal job as their counter parts in Europe and in China. Operator : Our last question is from John Kernan with Cowen. Your line is open. John Kernan : Hey, Matt, can you give a little more detail on the inventory obsolescence, the bad debt and the big supply chain costs? What's the level that you faced in the fourth quarter, obviously pretty significant, how do we think about those line items in the first quarter and as fiscal 2021 evolves? MattFriend: Sure, John. Let me break it down for you a little bit. The first thing I would say is that year-to-date through the first three quarters of fiscal year 2020, we delivered strong gross margin expansion, about 70 basis points excluding the impact of active FX and that was on the back of a really strong product portfolio, innovation and then ultimately our digital business. In the fourth quarter our gross margin was impacted by COVID-19 and the decision that we took to prioritize cleaning and right-sizing our inventory into Q2. And so the plans that we aggressively put in place to rebalance supply and demand did have an impact on our margins in Q4. But let me break down to [A24] [ph] maybe a little bit more. About 500 basis points of the impact was related to factory PO cancels, inventory obsolescence, as we were making decisions about the value of our inventory and our plans to liquidate it and then the negative rate impact due to lower wholesale shipments on our supply chain costs. What that last point really means is that as our press release said, our wholesale shipments were down 50%, but because our costs are mostly fixed, you see a negative rate impact as a result of that. And so as wholesale shipments start to pick up, you'll see less of an impact as you look toward the future. And then, we also had 70 basis points of FX headwind in the quarter. As we look ahead to next year, we do expect the market to remain promotional in the first half. And in Q4, we had about 250 basis points impact from like promotional activity, across our own stores and our partners as we were investing to liquidate inventory across the marketplace. As we look to the first half of next year, we expect that the marketplace will continue to be promotional as we and our partners are moving through this inventory to achieve our goal. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect to see sequential improvement relative to what we delivered in Q4 as we move quarter-by-quarter through the first half. I think you also asked about bad debt, so bad debt fits in SG&A, it doesn't fit in margin and it was $180 million in the quarter. I think that's really more reflective of the wholesale marketplace. And our risk assessment of some of our wholesale customers and the impact that this pandemic has had on their ability to pay Nike for receivables that were owed. And so if you connect the dots to what John said in terms of our strategic acceleration, we do believe that there is going to be consolidation and dislocation in wholesale distribution in North America and in EMEA and that's why we're taking a measured approach to growth in those geos as we look forward to next year. John Donahoe : And embracing the great wholesale partners that we think will be the real winners along with us and partnering as close as we can with them to build that marketplace of the future. John Kernan : That's excellent. Thank you. Excited to see the refinement of the Consumer Direct Offense. Best of luck. Andy Muir : So thanks, everyone, for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Take care and stay safe. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to one. In the event you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I will now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe. John Donahoe : Thank you, Andy, and hello to everyone on today\u2019s call. Before I get into our Q1 performance, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the passing of John Thompson last month. Coach, as many of us called him, was a beloved member of the NIKE family, having served on our Board of Directors for over 30 years. He was a true leader and an icon in the world of sport and we will miss him. And here on the West Coast, we are continuing to deal with the wildfires that have hit Oregon, Washington and California. Health and safety remain our first priority, so we closed facilities and stores where appropriate. For those teammates who have been impacted by evacuation orders, we have made additional benefits and support available, and the NIKE Foundation has donated $1 million to provide relief efforts for the Oregon wildfires, focusing on both intermediate and longer term needs. Moving to our business results. This quarter we continued to demonstrate NIKE\u2019s full competitive advantage. Over the past several months, we have established clear objectives for our business and we have been relentless in our focus on those objectives and the results reflecting that. Our revenue trend is improving, with Q1 flat to prior year on a constant currency basis. Greater China, EMEA, Japan and South Korea have already returned to growth. But more than the financial results, it\u2019s the continued strength of our brand, the response we are seeing from consumers and our unique position to be able to capitalize on our potential that excites me even more. We are getting stronger in the places that matter most and even in the midst of disruption we are on the offense. We have continued our unmatched pace of launching innovative product, generating a continuous flow of brand moments that connect with consumers and open groundbreaking retail concepts, as we unlock significant long-term opportunity in a very dynamic environment. We can navigate in fact we can thrive in this environment thanks to our digital advantage and the full breadth of our global portfolio. Building on our foundational strengths, there are three structural tailwinds that play to NIKE\u2019s advantage. The accelerated consumer shift toward digital is here to stay. The definition of sport to include all facets of health, wellness and fitness, and it\u2019s the deeply connected authentic brands with scale that will win. NIKE\u2019s strength amid these evolving conditions helped keep us in the lead. These advantages allow us to stay aggressive and it\u2019s why I believe that no company is better positioned to emerge from this period than NIKE. Over the past quarter, we continue to prove this out across four key areas. As always, it starts with product innovation. As I mentioned, our innovation pipeline and cadence has not slowed even during this uncertain environment. Second, our brand continues to deeply connect. Through the power of sport, we are creating hope and inspiration at a time when the world needs it. Third, we continue to take greater advantage of our vast digital opportunities the shift in consumer shopping preferences accelerates. And fourth, this digital focus is guiding how we create the future of retail, as we continue to launch seamless premium brick-and-mortar experiences.  Let me briefly touch on each of these four themes. Our belief in innovation is embedded in everything we do. New innovation continues to resonate with our consumers with key innovation platforms becoming an even bigger part of our mix in Q1. We had many product highlights this quarter. Let\u2019s just take a look at a few. We continue to bring fresh points of view to our most beloved footwear, Air Force 1, Air Jordan 1 and our deep lineup of Air Max. By continuously adding new styles, we expand these popular platforms. And we are also focused on fueling a constant cycle of new, scalable, distinct platforms. For instance, we reenergized the iconic Air Max 90 this year and it was one of the quarter\u2019s top growth drivers. We also push what\u2019s possible in sport as seen in the latest launch of our NIKE NEXT% Footwear platform. Eliud Kipchoge broke the two-hour barrier in a prototype of the Air Zoom Alphafly NEXT% and now the consumers have access to this innovation, we have heard from many that they are running their fastest times ever. This summer we also released a training shoe, the Air Zoom Tempo NEXT%, bringing the measurable benefit of NEXT% to runners focused on pace and endurance. And we are continuing to execute on the incredible opportunity we see in women\u2019s apparel. In Q1 we launched NIKE (M), NIKE\u2019s first dedicated maternity collection. We also introduced a new NIKE Yoga collection that serves all genders and body types with performance fabric innovation that\u2019s the result of more than two years of development. The response to this best-in-class Yoga collection has been amazing and is already driving incredible growth for our women\u2019s Yoga business. And last but not least, our sustainable footwear platform known as Space Hippie saw amazing sell-through in our highest-heat innovation launch ever. Coupled with the popularity we saw for VaporMax 2020, we are seeing real consumer appetite for sustainability, especially with our youngest consumers. Sustainability will continue to be a key aspect of our innovation agenda going forward. This is how NIKE leads. Innovation is deeply ingrained in this company, and over the past three months, as most companies focused on just surviving, we are continuously bringing forward new compelling product to market. Our innovation pipeline demonstrates both our strength, as well as our endurance. At NIKE, innovation is the systemic approach and it\u2019s how we extend our lead. Second, the power of the NIKE brand continues to be felt all over the world. In all 12 of our key cities, NIKE remains consumer\u2019s number one favored brand. In challenging times, we know how to drive meaningful connections with our consumers. You can see this in our market share gains across the NIKE and Jordan brands. Most notably, during the pandemic we have seen an acceleration of share gains in U.S. women\u2019s and apparel, two areas of strategic focus, and as always, we connect with consumers through the power of sport. We continue to see strong consumer engagement in the You Can\u2019t Stop Sport campaign with over 2.6 billion impressions, as we have reached more than 800 million unique consumers around the world. Our latest film Celebrates Sport as a source of inspiration. From Serena and Venus Williams and You Can\u2019t Stop Sisters to a sport cele -- spot celebrating Kobe Bryant who continues to inspire athletes all over the world on and off the court. The consumer energy around this broader campaign is testimony to NIKE\u2019s brand appeal at a time when so much is going on in the world. And at the same time, we create experiences and services that inspire and enable our members to keep pushing themselves further. In Q1 we saw an all-time high of the percentage of our members working out on the NIKE Training Club app with more than 50% of our members worldwide starting a workout in Q1. And in the NIKE Running Club, we have seen four consecutive months of more than 1 million downloads each month of our audio-guided runs. For those that have missed the comradery of group runs during the pandemic, runners are telling us they are enjoying the connection and extra push offered by this feature. And in Q1 for the first time ever, women completed more of these runs than men. We are also connecting to our purpose and values, as our brand continues to be culturally embedded throughout the world of sport and beyond. Our athletes are doing the same. Just this month, you saw Naomi Osaka give voice to the Black Lives Matter movement by sitting out the finals of the tournament just prior to the U.S. Open before returning to the U.S. Open and winning it. With leadership from global sports icons like Naomi and NBA players like LeBron and Yanus, as well as the thousands of others who have stood up and spoken out, our athletes are having a profound impact in our society. All-in-all, from the cultural resonance of our brand to our expansion of what sport can mean, Q1 was a quarter that showed a relentless focus on deepening connections with our consumers matters. Third, I continue to be excited by the opportunity I see for NIKE in digital. We know that digital is the new normal. The consumer today is digitally grounded and simply will not revert back. Our NIKE Digital business is already meeting our mix goal of 30%, nearly three years ahead of schedule and we will continue to grow from here. This quarter, our owned digital channel grew 83% on a currency-neutral basis, driving almost 900 million of incremental revenue versus the prior year, and an acceleration versus the prior quarter even as our doors at retail reopened. Our engagement and membership metrics show incredible momentum. For example, we are seeing almost 200% growth in demand for our NIKE Commerce app, with triple-digit growth in monthly active users. This is significant for us, as it speaks to the increasing consumer adoption of our apps and while we have had tremendous success in digital and quickly pivoted to the accelerated consumer shift, I truly believe that NIKE is just scratching the surface of what\u2019s possible. With our breadth and depth no one has the advantage in this space that NIKE has to directly connect with consumers. NIKE\u2019s digital transformation strategy is not easily replicated. Simply put, scale matters and NIKE leads and we will continue to lead in this space for all the reasons I have already mentioned. Our size, our incredible product, our brand strength and infinity, the direct consumer relationships who deepen each day and our ability to create seamless and differentiated shopping experiences, that is how we drive continued separation. Now we know this is a multiyear journey and we have a bright future and lots of opportunity, but in many ways, we are just getting started. To-date, we have done some impressive things to achieve scale, highlighted by our app ecosystem, our RFID investment and our omnichannel distribution centers. And as part of the Consumer Direct Acceleration, we have some clear immediate priorities including scaling O2O, improving personalization and creating a consistent end-to-end technology platform. And of course, we remain focused on increasing member engagement to unlock value for both NIKE and our consumers. After all, we know a consumer who connects with us on two or more platforms has a lifetime value that\u2019s 4 times higher than those who don\u2019t. And in particular, I am focused on how we will leverage consumer data and insights in our digital ecosystem to understand and serve consumers better, and ultimately, increase our competitive advantage. We will use data to stay a step ahead and help us create a better product as consumer insights power our business end-to-end toward even greater growth. Fourth and finally, digital is fueling how we create the future of retail. This is the first quarter since the start of the pandemic where our retail was essentially opened. And as more consumers return to our stores, we saw impressive conversion in-store, even as our Digital business accelerated even further. Our store traffic and sales are improving quarter-over-quarter and we are also seeing consumers increasingly self-identify as a member during checkout, or as we call it, a linked transaction, which is leading to even more engagement on our apps and an elevated O2O journey. This is our vision for the marketplace, a digitally connected experience where membership is a true differentiator. Just as our continuous product pipeline, we continue to innovate in the retail space. We are accelerating the shift we discussed last quarter to OneNike Marketplace as part of our digital PDA acceleration. As you will recall, our OneNike Marketplace approach leads with NIKE Digital and our own stores, as well as a smaller number of strategic partners who share our vision to provide a consistent and seamless consumer experience. In fact, during quarter, we took focused actions to proactively shift the North America marketplace as part of our strategy to serve consumers more consistently and more personally. Simply put, we are on the offense and accelerating toward this future vision and this is evident by our new and innovative retail concepts, amplified by an elevated O2O consumer journey. Just in Q1, we launched new stores in Guangzhou, China, Soule, Los Angeles and Paris, with two new doors coming in New York City in the next two weeks. These stores range across many different formats, from our House of Innovation Concept in Paris to a new NIKE factory store in the Watts neighborhood of L.A. as we deepen our connection in key cities and all of these concepts are underpinned by digital. I will go a little deeper in one just as an example. Our new store in Guangzhou is a data powered store concept that curates a one-to-one personalized shopping journey. We are already seeing member checkout in our Guangzhou store significantly outpace the rest of the fleet. This is just one reflection of how digitally-enabled our future of retail is and how membership is a critical differentiator. Personally, one of the things I am most thrilled about is the return to organized sport. In fact there was a day earlier this month when you could watch the NBA, NFL, Major League Baseball, WNBA, NHL, Tennis, U.S. Open, a Golf tournament and about six different global football leagues all taking place within the same 24 hours. Though health and safety remain paramount, you can just feel the optimism and excitement of sport coming back. And as we look to the Tokyo Olympics next summer, NIKE remains in a unique position to serve our consumers and fuel their passion for sport. And so as you can see, even during market uncertainty, we are not slowing down. NIKE is staying on the offense and looking to extend our leadership position. We have that ability. And as I have said before, these are times when the strong can get stronger and I am energized by our incredible potential. In closing, I want to thank our teammates all over the world who continue to innovate, execute and show tremendous resilience throughout a challenging year. I could not be more proud of them and we can\u2019t wait to show you what we are going to do next. With that, I will now turn the call over to Matt. Matt Friend : Thank you, John, and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE entered the pandemic with unparalleled brand and business momentum, and while we continue to navigate through uncertain dynamics, sport has returned, interest in activity and health, fitness and wellness has never been greater, consumer connection and engagement with our brand is growing and NIKE is transforming the way we operate to better serve all consumers. Looking forward, we believe that NIKE is stronger and now even better positioned to drive separation than prior to the pandemic. As I reflect on the first quarter, there are three key strategic and financial themes that stand out. First, NIKE is recovering faster, fueled by brand momentum and our relentless focus on execution. Second, we are accelerating investments in capabilities and services that will create value for the consumer, while simultaneously accelerating productivity. And third, our consumer led digital transformation is clearly a catalyst for long-term revenue and earnings growth. Let me take a few minutes to walk through each of these points. First, as discussed on previous earnings calls, we implemented an enterprise wide operational plan at the onset of the pandemic. Our teams have navigated with agility and focus to recalibrate supply and demand, to increase digital distribution capacity, to secure liquidity and to tightly manage costs, all while ensuring the health and safety of our employees and consumers. As a result, NIKE, Inc. first quarter reported revenue declined 1% versus prior year and was flat on a constant currency basis. And reported EBIT grew 13% versus prior year, all a sharp acceleration from last quarter and exceeding our internal plans. There are a few elements that are important for me to highlight here. Despite ongoing uncertainty, more countries are emerging from containment and have returned to growth, China, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France and Germany just to name a few. Marketplace inventory is healthy and within our targeted guardrails. NIKE inventory levels have improved since May, with Q1 inventory growing 15% versus prior year, as compared to 31% growth in Q4 and is on track to be normalized in the next 60 days. We are reducing excess inventory at lower promotional levels relative to the overall marketplace, highlighting the strength of our brand and the value of our key product franchises and we ended Q1 in a net cash position, generating positive free cash flow and increasing our liquidity to over $13 billion. These financial results offer clear evidence of a faster marketplace recovery for NIKE, fueled by consumer demand for all our brands. Our momentum is building, and more importantly, our market share is accelerating around the world. We now expect reported revenue to be roughly flat versus prior year in the first half of fiscal \u201821. This leads me to the second theme. We are accelerating investments in capabilities and services that will create value for the consumer, while simultaneously accelerating productivity. As you have seen over the last two quarters our priorities are clear. We will continue to both accelerate investment against our digital transformation and prudently manage other spending. At the same time, we are focused on amplifying our brand impact. Over the past two quarters, as we have seen demand for our Digital business rapidly accelerate, we have invested to further increase Digital fulfillment capacity and inventory visibility. Our new regional service center near Los Angeles went live this month and uses predictive modeling to anticipate consumer demand and ensure the product our consumers want is available and will arrive within one day to two days. We will achieve this level of service at a lower fulfillment cost over time. We scaled ship-from-store capabilities in North America\u2019s NIKE brand in-line stores, which now represent over 20% of revenue in enabled doors. These capabilities will be enhanced by our RFID investments, highlighting dramatic improvement we are making in our O2O service performance. We are scaling robotics and automation in our logistics operations, accelerating digital throughput and cutting order cycle times by up to 50%, especially during times of heightened safety measures due to COVID-19, this allowed our teams to serve higher levels of digital demand with greater efficiency and precision. We have already deployed this automation in North America, Japan and EMEA, and we will continue to scale these critical improvements further as delivery becomes increasingly important in consumer buying decisions and while we double-down on the strategic capabilities required to fuel our digital acceleration, we are simultaneously driving a sharper prioritization and sequencing of our investments. For example, we drove significant leverage in our demand creation spending versus prior year in the last two quarters, creating fewer, but significantly more impactful brand campaigns. We were also able to increase the return performance marketing investment, driving accelerated digital demand and greater digital engagement. The NIKE and Jordan brands are stronger than ever, delivering historic records of engagement through nearly 5 billion social media impressions just this quarter. Another example is how our organizational restructuring will simplify the way we work, eliminate duplication and redundancy and realign our resources to focus on our biggest growth opportunities. While we will incur a nonrecurring charge to affect this plan in fiscal \u201821, this restructuring will also create a similar level of recurring annual cost savings that will help fuel the acceleration of our digital transformation. In this moment, the pandemic has allowed us to accelerate where and how we will invest. Ultimately, we will drive deeper consumer connections and continue to amplify our brand strength, using technology to operate more efficiently and at greater scale. This brings me to my final theme. Our consumer led digital transformation is clearly a catalyst for long-term revenue and earnings growth. Our Digital business grew 83% in Q1 on a currency-neutral basis. And as John mentioned, Digital, across owned and partner, now represents over 30% of our total business, up more than 10 points of share versus the prior year. But more importantly, we saw tremendous momentum in the measures of success that matter most to create scale and drive long-term profitability. These include member engagement and owned digital market share. In Q1, NIKE active members increased nearly 60% with even higher growth in buying members. We also drove strong double-digit growth in contactable members. We saw owned digital market share gains across both the U.S. and key countries in EMEA, which gives us confidence in our ability to sustain and to grow our digital penetration even as physical retail traffic continues to recover. What\u2019s even more important though is that we can see several strategic and financial benefits from accelerating our digital transformation. First, by leveraging data to enhance membership, personalization and consumer-oriented O2O services across the marketplace, we can drive greater inventory efficiency and unlock accelerated growth in key opportunities like women\u2019s and apparel. Second, in a normalized period, we earn roughly 10 points higher gross margin rate on our digital revenue versus wholesale. And while we will need to continue investments to expand digital fulfillment capacity, we can improve operational efficiency through predictive modeling tools, data-driven member personalization and inventory staging. And finally, we will manage digital transformation within our SG&A guardrails. As we accelerate the pace of investment, our technology foundation will enable us to unlock operating efficiency through automation and increase productivity across the organization. Further, as we grow digital engagement and we retain a higher proportion of engaged members with increased buying frequency, we will be lowering customer acquisition costs, increasing our return on ad spend and changing the shape of our demand creation investment. As John said earlier, we know that digital is the new normal and as we drive continued separation in the market, through a connected, seamless and modern consumer experiences, we will fuel growth and profitability. Now let\u2019s turn to the details of our first quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. Q revenue declined 1% and was flat on a currency neutral basis, as NIKE Direct grew 13% led by strong digital growth offset by declines in our Wholesale business. Gross margin decreased 90 basis points in Q1 versus the prior year, as a result of impacts from COVID-19 including higher promotions to reduce excess inventory across the marketplace and higher supply chain costs. These factors were offset slightly by favorable full price product margins and the reversal of certain reserves associated with purchase order cancellations due to higher than anticipated consumer demand. SG&A declined 11% in Q1. We tightly managed operating expenses including lower and more effective marketing spend as live sporting events slowly started to resume, while investing to support accelerating digital growth and transformation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.5%, compared to 12.4% for the same period last year, primarily due to benefits from stock-based compensation, offset by a reserve for a discrete tax matter. First quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.95 up 10% versus prior year. With that, let\u2019s turn to our reported operating segments. Despite varied recovery curves and macroeconomic dynamics, our geographies have some key themes in common in Q1, first, strong digital growth and increasing member engagement, second, women\u2019s outperformance versus men\u2019s and a growing Jordan brand, and third, lower physical traffic in our NIKE owned stores versus last year, although substantially improved versus the prior quarter. Traffic trends were partially offset by higher conversion rates and higher spend per transaction. In North America specifically, Q1 revenue declined 1% on a currency neutral basis and EBIT increased 18% on a reported basis. Digital was up nearly 100% driven by triple-digit growth in full price sales and fueled by strong momentum in iconic styles like the Air Force 1 and Air Jordan 1, along with women\u2019s apparel, which grew nearly 200% in the quarter. Demand on the NIKE App grew 150% in Q1, highlighting the continued shift to mobile experiences.  Finally, as we cut purchase orders to recalibrate supply and demand in North America during the first half in fiscal \u201821, we shifted product allocations to fuel higher demand in NIKE Digital and our smaller group of strategic wholesale partners. The result was high single-digit growth in differentiated wholesale, offset by a decline of over 20% in undifferentiated wholesale, all with a higher full price realization versus the prior year. This is a trend that we expect to continue throughout this fiscal year as we change the shape of the North America marketplace. In EMEA, Q1 revenue grew 5% on a currency neutral basis and EBIT grew 14% on a reported basis. Recovery in Italy and Spain continues to lag recovery across the rest of Western Europe. NIKE Direct grew over 25%, with over 100% digital growth driven by lifestyle products as the consumer focus on comfort continues. Apparel in EMEA grew 11% on a currency-neutral basis led by the performance categories of running, training, basketball and global football, which featured our biggest club launch ever with Liverpool FC. EMEA also continues to lead globally with our Express Lane offense, maximizing supply availability and actively managing inventory, while capturing emerging trends. Express Lane drove revenue growth and generated higher full price realization in the quarter. With that, let\u2019s turn to Greater China, which continued its strong momentum with 80% growth on a currency neutral basis, with Mainland China delivering double-digit growth. NIKE Direct grew over 20%, with more balance channel growth as digital grew nearly 30% and NIKE owned stores were up double-digits fueled by key consumer moments like 6/18 where NIKE was the number one sports brand on Tmall. NIKE Sportswear and Basketball grew double-digit growth in the quarter, with strong sell-through of key innovation launches like the Alphafly NEXT%, Space Hippie and the AJ 1 FlyEase. Retail sales in the China marketplace are accelerating, with an increasing proportion of full price sales. Physical retail traffic continues to grow and is approaching prior year levels and we are also well positioned for Singles\u2019 Day in November. Finally, in our APLA geography, Q1 revenue declined 12% on a currency neutral basis, including digital growth that exceeded 90%. We continue to see varied impacts of COVID-19 across countries in the region, with growth in the Asia-Pacific region being led by Japan, Pacific and South Korea, while recovery in Latin America and certain countries in Southeast Asia continues at a slower pace. Performance footwear resonated with consumers in APLA this quarter, as we saw strong results from the Alphafly NEXT% and the Pegasus 37. Jordan has also continued to excite the consumer with locally relevant product, like the AJ 34, Rui Hachimura, which was Japan\u2019s best selling basketball launch ever. As I have said last quarter, fiscal \u201821 will continue to be a time of uncertainty, because virus containment patterns around the world remain volatile. Therefore, each market recovery will not be linear and the comparisons with prior year will become increasingly less intuitive. We are focused on what we can control, deepening our consumer connections while we manage risk and uncertainty in this environment. We are tightly buying inventory and are focused on ensuring the long-term health of all of our brands and our key product franchises, with the first quarter now complete, I will update our full year financial outlook. Despite the continued uncertainties, we now expect revenue to be up high-single digits to low-double digits versus prior year. Stronger than anticipated demand for our brands will be constrained in the near-term due to supply decisions we took in the face of the pandemic, with growth in the second half to be up significantly versus prior year. Our gross margin outlook will continue to be a function of prioritizing a return to normalized inventory levels by the end of Q2. In the second half, we expected again seeing sequential improvement in full price sales, but we do expect a continuation of higher markdown activity in our factory stores to sustain conversion rates on lower traffic. For the full year, we now expect gross margin to be flat versus prior year, including 40 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. We now expect SG&A will be flat versus prior year, including approximately $200 million of $250 million of non-recurring execution costs incurred in the first half associated with simplifying our organizational structure. NIKE is poised to emerge from the current environment stronger and better positioned, with a sharper focus, a clearer view of our brand\u2019s long-term future and with a team that is energized to compete and to win. At the same time, we are managing our business to deliver financial results that will set a strong foundation for growth and profitability in fiscal year \u201822 and beyond. The future for NIKE is bright. I wouldn\u2019t trade our position with anyone. With that, we will now open the call up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Bob Drbul : Hi, guys. Good afternoon. John Donahoe : Good afternoon, Bob. Bob Drbul : I guess just, the first question that I have really is, on -- if you could maybe spend a little bit more time on the gross margin performance. And can you just give us the buckets in the various units, is there any quantification around the promotions the supply chain, the full price selling, just help us get our hands around the various drivers of the gross margin this quarter. And maybe Matt, if you could just a little bit more around and you gave some commentary for the full year, but maybe just the drivers of that performance for the remainder of the year would be very helpful? Thanks. Matt Friend : Sure, Bob. So, in the first quarter, our gross margin was down 90 basis points versus prior year, and obviously, that was a substantial improvement versus the results we had in the fourth quarter, really reflecting the strength of NIKE\u2019s market recovery. However, Q1 did benefit from about 55 basis points of one-time accrual reversals that we had incurred in Q4. The biggest of which related to factory PO cancellations, which we reinstated some supply due to the strong demand we were seeing in the quarter. So if you add that back you get to a gross margin down roughly 145 basis points versus the prior year and that\u2019s driven by markdown activity to work through and normalize our supply. As we look ahead to Q2, Bob, our margin will continue to be a function of supply and demand management, because our top priority is to normalize inventory by the end of the second quarter. And we expect Q2 will probably be more promotional than what we saw in Q1 because of holiday, the seasonal consumer moments like 11.11 in China and then this year we got Cyber Monday in Q2 whereas last year it flipped into Q3. And we also are seeing despite our strong performance a lot of inventory still in the marketplace and so that\u2019s how we are looking at the first half of the year. As we look to the second half, as I mentioned in my remarks, we are expecting sequential improvement with a higher mix of full price sales and we will start to see the benefits in our supply chain from exiting the extra storage that we needed for inventory in the first half. We also expect though that we are going to need to maintain an investment and discounts in our factory stores, because we are not anticipating traffic to recover to prior year levels in the balance of the year. And so we are assuming that there will continue to be some promotional activity in the second half of the year to maintain conversion rates and unit velocity as we keep -- as we continue to operate through the balance of the year. Bob Drbul : Great. Thanks. Matt Friend : All-in-all, Bob, that is next to about flat versus prior year. Bob Drbul : Perfect. Thanks, Matt. I guess, just a follow-up quick question is, have you guys considered with the Cactus Jack, maybe some sort of collaboration with McDonald\u2019s in terms of do the happy meal with the Cactus Jack and get a pair of shoes or anything like that, is that in the pipeline at all? John Donahoe : Bob, I can give a one-word answer to that question, no. Bob Drbul : All right. Thanks very much and nice quarter guys. Way to go. John Donahoe : Thanks, Bob. Operator : Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Kimberly Greenberger : Great. Thank you so much. I appreciated your comments, Matt, on the digital margins, obviously, a very nice, I think, you said, 10-point higher gross margin than wholesale in your digital channel. I am wondering if you can just cover some of the key unlocks that you visualize or that you envision happening over the next few years that will basically allow that digital operating margin to track higher over time. Is it an ever lower customer acquisition cost, is it more efficient fulfillment of orders or scale, any of those -- any color on that would be helpful? Thanks. Matt Friend : Sure, Kimberly. You almost answered the question for me there hitting the points. But, yeah, so it starts with where John was in his prepared remarks. We obviously believe that scale for our digital business is going to drive significant financial benefits as we continue to grow the size of that business and leverage the capability that we continue to develop. I think there\u2019s probably three key drivers of operating margin improvement that we see from leveraging scale of our digital business. The first one just relates to leveraging data and the data that we continue to gather as a growing business to create personalized product offerings for consumers. And the benefit that will drive is higher price realization and less markdowns of product that we are selling digitally to consumers. The second piece is also kind of connected to data, which is where do we place our inventory and how do we flow it, so that we can be closer to the consumer, and ultimately, lower our fulfillment costs, and we believe that will continue to -- that will be a driver as well of continued gross margin expansion. And then the third piece kind of ties back to what I referenced on our performance marketing investment in marketing. We have got to move deeper into the funnel, less new member -- moving from attracting and acquiring new members to retaining members, knowing those members and driving more engagement and frequency of purchase within our existing member base. And we believe that by running that offense, we will see more productivity in our demand creation spend and a higher return on our demand creation spend. And by doing that, we should be able to also drive additional operating margin expansion. Kimberly Greenberger : Fantastic. Thank you. Matt Friend : Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Binetti : Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking my question and a nice job in the quarter in a very tough backdrop. I guess, looking at the North America and maybe, I mean, EMEA EBIT dollar growth significantly outpacing revenue growth in those markets. I guess, dovetailing off Kimberly\u2019s question, how helpful was improving digital markets, I am sorry, digital margins in those markets in this quarter? Is that something that\u2019s already on the move as you see the growth rates that you are seeing in those markets with the digital business? Matt Friend : Yes, Michael. So we are seeing a benefit from increased digital penetration on our margins within those two geographies. But I would also want to highlight that the strategy and the focus on shifting the marketplace, exiting undifferentiated wholesale distribution and focusing on our direct business and our strategic partners drove higher full price realization as well in both of those markets in the quarter, which also fueled our gross margin. And so those two factors in particular were large drivers of gross margin performance in the quarter. And then we also had some SG&A leverage in those geographies in the quarter as we were managing spend and working through new ways of working from a corporate perspective and that also helped to fuel EBIT growth relative to revenue growth in the quarter. Michael Binetti : Got you. And then I guess as a follow up, as you look at North America, John, as you have gotten into the business and had a chance to kind of think about the different regions, the sales growth in North America has been very strong for a couple years gathering few billion dollars over the last few years but the margins been fairly stagnant there, despite the brand being very strong, obviously, gaining momentum. As you saw more pronounced shift in the business in wholesale here in the quarter, some of that probably forced on you by the macro backdrop. But what do you think about the margin evolution in North America from here as we normalize and get on the other side of this COVID period and look out to the second half of this year and into 2022? John Donahoe : Well, Michael, if I step back, I would say, the North America market -- the North America retail market is the most fragmented and least far along of where it needs to get to of the major markets in the world. And so in this world, where consumers want a seamless, digital and physical experience, they want to know who they are, they want consistent premium, modern experiences. The North America retail market today is the furthest away from that. And so that\u2019s what\u2019s driving our OneNike Marketplace where we lead with digital, directly connect with them for all the reasons Matt\u2019s already described. We then follow with our NIKE Direct where we have very premium experiences that are often digitally infused and then we work with fewer strategic partners who see the world the same way we see the world. And want to provide these consistent experiences for our consumers, want to provide the same level of knowledge and understanding so consumers know who they are, regardless of where they are shopping. Consumers want what they want when they want it and how they want it and so we are simply accelerating that transition. We are accelerating what probably would have happened in the retail environment on a naturally in the next four years to five years, we are going to try to drive it for our business in the next one years to two years. And that will for all the reasons Matt has described that will have financial benefits, that will have profitability benefits, in addition to having growth and market share benefits, which is what we are really focusing on. Michael Binetti : John, thanks a lot for the help. John Donahoe : Great. Operator : Next question is from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Omar Saad : Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for all the information. A quick clarification on the digital trends, I believe last quarter when you spoke to us, I think, to the exit rate was triple digits in June, obviously, it\u2019s still a huge number for the overall quarter, but maybe just help us understand did that digital rate slow at the stores and the conversion came back in the bricks-and-mortars part of your DTC business? And I\u2019d also love your -- an updated kind of view on outlook on the return of team in organized sports, the NBA playoffs, NFL is back, do you think this is going to continue to build over time even at the youth and collegiate level as well and how are you guys capitalizing on your integration and deep roots in all those sports? Thanks. Matt Friend : Sure, Omar. Why don\u2019t I take the first part and then maybe John will grab the second piece of it. So, yes, when we had our last earnings call, we referenced that we were seeing strong triple-digit growth in digital in the month of June. And what I\u2019d say is that in North America, EMEA and APLA, we continue to deliver above or at 100% -- triple-digit growth in digital in the quarter. The place where we saw more balanced growth in the quarter was in Greater China, where retail traffic has recovered closer to prior year levels and is approaching prior year levels, but digital was still the fastest growing channel in that marketplace at over 30% growth. So the only thing that I would say that that might even remotely sound like a deceleration is Greater China growth as the marketplace is normalized. But we continue to believe that digital will lead the way of growth for Greater China. Omar Saad : Got it. John Donahoe : And Omar on the second, how cool is it to be able on a weekend to watch literally within hours NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL, college football, U.S. Open Tennis, a major golf tournament. And first thing I\u2019d just add is to just congratulate the commissioners of the major sports leagues who have just done a fabulous job of bringing sport back safely, safely for the players and coaches and then providing what are unprecedented viewership opportunities. And so, we are thrilled about that, we are trying to work very closely with them to help encourage that wherever possible. We think that\u2019s good for consumers and it\u2019s ultimately good for NIKE. Does that continue and does it cascade down to college and high school and youth, I say my prayers every night and hope so. I think the -- I\u2019d say safety is paramount and the more you get in a distributed environment and a less controlled environment obviously the more challenging that is. And so we completely embrace balancing safety but also return to sport. And I think the other part of this is not organized sport but we are seeing is and I think these things are related. People are more engaged as sort of this movement toward health and fitness and wellness, which I think started when people being confined to their homes. We are seeing it continue to accelerate. You watch a game on TV and you want to go out for a run right or you go shoot baskets in the driveway and so I think sport is so healthy for the world right now and we are going to do everything we can, including, by the way, some of the brand moments that we are trying to celebrate to reinforce. I just love the Venus and Serena spot. It just celebrates the power sport has in connecting with consumers and so you hear the excitement in my voice, I can tell you, all 75 people here at NIKE love sport, love sport coming back and we are cautiously optimistic that will continue until we get through this pandemic. Omar Saad : Thank, John. Thanks, Matt. Best wishes. John Donahoe : Thanks, Omar. Operator : Next question is from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your line is open. Jim Duffy : Thank you. Hello, everyone. Terrific rebound in the business. My question, I am hoping you can provide an update on the RFID implementation and any benefits you are seeing with inventory management, demand forecasting? And then maybe talk about how these benefits materialize in the model in coming quarters and years? What are some of the key metrics we should watch for the progress on that? Matt Friend : So, Jim, in the quarter, we continued to rollout RFID across both our supply chain and our stores, and given where things are sitting in the pandemic at this point in time, we were able to leverage the inventory visibility in order to be able to take advantage of some of the -- take advantage of the demand that we had across the marketplace and across our retail stores. We now have 100% of our footwear, as I think, we have told you before and 75% of our apparel tag. So, we got over a 1 billion units at 99.99% readability, which enables us to see our inventory now across all of our factory stores and there lies in our own doors and they help to accelerate our [O2O] capabilities by providing a clear line of sight to the inventory levels. RFID is going to drive improved inventory holding costs and it\u2019s also going to help us reduce our transportation costs, both in direct and in wholesale, and we believe that\u2019s going to be a critical enabler in order for us to create a fully connected marketplace for NIKE products across both our owned stores and our strategic partners. John Donahoe : And I\u2019d just build on that, what Matt talked about last quarter. The real issues -- the real story is data, right? The way data then infuses that with the Celect acquisition, where we are able to forward deploy inventory to be able to predict demand reliably enough, where we can forward deploy inventory, so it\u2019s within one to two day ground shipping to a large number of consumers across the country. And again, that\u2019s where the scale competitive advantage comes from in our supply chain because we will be able to forecast demand, get the right inventory in the right places to get it to consumers quickly both for ourselves and maybe even over time, that\u2019s an added benefit for our strategic wholesale partners. Jim Duffy : Very helpful. Thank you, guys. John Donahoe : Thanks, Jim. Operator : The next question is from Jamie Merriman with Bernstein. Your line is open. Jamie Merriman : Thanks very much. John, and Matt, you both talked about some of the examples of the digital investments that you made so far, the app ecosystem, the omnichannel fulfillment capabilities and RFID. So I am wondering as you think about the business from here, Matt, you talked a lot about continuing to invest. Are there particular areas where you feel like you need to invest further? Is it greater data capabilities? Is it just building out more fulfillment options like the one you have on the West Coast or are you now at the point where you can start to leverage some of the investments behind data and RFID, is it really just a matter of scale? Matt Friend : Jamie, it\u2019s interesting, because I have a little bit of an outside point of view of this and I must say from a Board perspective, I saw the investment NIKE was making in digital and boy, you see the result of that, the fact that we have a clear digital advantage today. That said, having had a technology background, I feel like there\u2019s so much opportunity remaining that we are still just scratching the surface of what\u2019s possible. And so in particular, the way we think about it is, consumer facing digital, right? Demand sensing, little things. This quarter, we turned on machine learning on search and a little bit of improvement drove greater conversion. By the way, that\u2019s continuous, so the ability to use AI and machine learning, digital demand sensing, insight gathering, digital marketing, membership personalization, even inventory optimization. I think we still got ample benefits and ample opportunity in the consumer-facing side of things. And those are things like in technology, they are not big bangs. It\u2019s a whole series of continuous and ongoing improvements that by the way are very measurable and enhance growth or improve profitability. And then beyond that where I think we still have huge opportunities we now have one integrated technology roadmap and we are applying that across our entire company end-to-end and so whether it is the manufacturing through supply chain and the automation opportunities that exist, whether it\u2019s using robotics or other ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness, our whole product creation area. One of the people that is most excited about the opportunity to digitize is our Head of Design, John Hoke and just how digital can really enhance not only the productivity but also the creativity of our designers. And so we now have a clear three-year roadmap that to bring technology to every element of our operation and every element of our end-to-end business, and the nice thing about that is in almost every case, you can define measurable benefits, whether it\u2019s enhanced growth, deeper connection with consumers or improved efficiency with automation and use of -- intelligent use of technology, so I think all of us view this as a real opportunity. Operator : [Inaudible] Andy Muir : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Matthew Boss : Great. Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter. So on the financial algorithm and as we think through the accelerated shift to digital, and I think you had said, within the guardrails of SG&A that you have outlined. Are there any offsetting headwinds constraining your ability to potentially outpace your outlined high single-digit topline and mid-teens earnings growth rates as we think moving forward? Matt Friend : Well. Hey, Matt. Thanks for the question. As I mentioned in the last call, we believe that the Consumer Direct Acceleration is clearly a tailwind or a fuel to our long-term financial model. Our goals and our principles related to how we financially manage the business are really unchanged to deliver sustainable, profitable and capital efficient growth over time, obviously, right now, we are in the middle of a quite an uncertain moment and pandemic. And while we are sharing with you our perspectives on the opportunities that we see as we look toward the future, the reality is that this environment right now is quite uncertain. And so what we are going to be focused on over the next 90 days to 120 days is continuing to clean our inventory, continuing to create those consumer connections like we have been talking about and really focus on our OneNike marketplace strategy, exiting undifferentiated wholesale distribution and focusing on the opportunities that we see for NIKE Direct and our strategic partners. And we believe that this strategy will fuel growth and profitability in line with the long-term financial model that we have previously communicated. Obviously, there are a number of factors that are outstanding that may create disruption over periods of time as we look at it and the most obvious one right now is just the pandemic and the impact it has on consumer demand and consumption in the near-term. And so, we are continuing to focus on the strategy and the shift because we think it\u2019s the right thing to do long-term and that\u2019s where our focus and attention is going to be at this time. We are investing in building this business for the long-term and that\u2019s where our focus is. Matthew Boss : Great. Congrats. Best of luck. Andy Muir : Thank you, Matt, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Take care. John Donahoe : Thank, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to one. In the event you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe. John Donahoe : Thank you, Andy, and hello and happy holidays to everyone on today\u2019s call. Before I get into our Q2 performance, I want to acknowledge the global environment right now. We continue to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic with surges across the U.S. and in many countries around the world. In fact, consistent with social distancing norms Matt, Andy and I are doing this call from our homes. So, if this audio sounds a little different, that\u2019s why it\u2019s in the Zoom world. And we\u2019re feeling optimistic, with positive news on vaccines, but in the meantime, we hope everyone stays safe out there. Looking at Q2, our strong business results reflect our relentless focus on our objectives. I\u2019m going to talk this quarter about the same themes I talked about last quarter. And most probably next quarter, I\u2019ll talk to you about them again. The reason for this consistency is that our strategy is sound. Our strategy is working. And we\u2019re excited by what we\u2019re seeing as we continue to execute it. In Q2, we returned to growth of 9% on a reported basis. This revenue improvement reflects currency-neutral growth across all of our geographies, NIKE Digital up 80% globally, and women\u2019s growth outpacing our overall growth. But beyond any one quarter\u2019s results, the clear momentum we have right now is evidence of our product innovation and brand strength that allows us to connect with consumers worldwide. I\u2019ve said it before. These are times when strong brands get stronger. The structural tailwinds we\u2019re seeing, including permanent shifts towards digital, athletic wear, and health and wellness continue to offer us incredible opportunity. And of course, as organized sport returns around the world, that energy creates yet another tailwind for NIKE. For example, we were excited to see so many runners participating in the Shanghai Marathon two weeks ago. Speaking of Greater China, the growth we saw there in Q2 is evidence of the progress we\u2019ve made toward our end-to-end digital transformation, which allows us to better manage volatility and deliver strong growth. As a result, in Q2 Greater China grew 19% on a currency-neutral basis and 24% on a reported basis. Our success in Greater China was also driven by a triumphant Singles\u2019 Day, in which NIKE yet again was the number one sport brand, with the highest store demand and highest traffic on Tmall. This growth underscores how we engage with consumers on Singles\u2019 Day, bringing more than 4 million new members to NIKE. Overall, Singles\u2019 Day drove more than a $0.5 billion in digital demands. More broadly, this holiday season also was highlighted by the record-setting digital sales we saw during Black Friday week, which has shown the power of our digital transformation all over the globe. Digital is now woven into everything we do as a company. It\u2019s how we operate and prioritize, from how we engage with members, to how we operate our supply chain, to how we serve consumers in the marketplace. Today, I\u2019d like to focus on two key areas of increasing competitive advantage for us, our leadership and innovation, and our incredible brand momentum. Let\u2019s start with product and innovation. Innovation has always been our lifeblood at NIKE. It\u2019s what continues to create separation between us and our competition. Our return to growth this quarter was fueled by our relentless innovation pipeline. In the last 90 days, we\u2019ve introduced exciting products at an impressive pace, and this will continue going forward. Through innovation, we are serving consumers in ways no other brand can. We\u2019re using digital to connect product to consumers like never before. We\u2019re bringing more athletes into sport, through inclusivity, and we\u2019re scaling sustainable materials further in our product portfolio. This quarter\u2019s launches in basketball, including the LeBron 18 and the Kyrie 7 have sold incredibly well. I\u2019m particularly excited that both were launched digital first. The LeBron 18 was introduced in September through an integrated live stream with Tencent in Greater China, driving deeper connection to local hoops culture. And we\u2019ve launched the Kyrie 7 by announcing four colorways available only as mystery purchases, through the SNKRS app. In women\u2019s our (M) maternity collection is connecting with consumers in the marketplace with a 100% sell-through of tights in the first two days. Due to high consumer demand for our new maternity wear, we\u2019re bringing more units into the marketplace and rolling out more content and inspiration for women, pre and postpartum on our activity apps. This is a great example of how we start with product and then scale further through engagement to deepen our connection with consumers. We also grow sport through inclusivity. For example, we continue to extend our size offerings as we give more consumers access to sport. For example, in women\u2019s, we now have more than 100 styles of extended sized apparel across NIKE and Jordan, and we will continue to further increase our offering. And this quarter, we launched extended sizing in our kids business in North America with a plan to increase to 25% of our kids\u2019 assortment next summer. Finally, sustainability will always be core to our innovation efforts. 85% of our recently launched ACG apparel collection contains more than 90% recycled materials. And we\u2019ll also continue to scale sustainability through our sportwear icons. In fact, just this past quarter, we launched our new sustainable Crater Foam in both Air Force 1 and Waffle Racer. The demand for these products and more shows that consumer hunger for sustainability continues to accelerate. We are proud of this innovation pipeline, and we have no plans to slow down. In coming quarters, new innovations will include exciting new women\u2019s products in Jordan Brand, a new learning style designed to help reduce injury, and our first performance shoe in our sustainable footwear platform. Innovation differentiates NIKE. We don\u2019t settle for the lead, and our ability to innovate remains unrivaled. It\u2019s so fundamental to us that we increased our investment in innovation during the uncertainty of the pandemic to create even further separation. This is how NIKE stays in the lead. Moving to our brand strength. Our deep connection with consumers through authentic brand moments at global scale also continues to expand our leadership position. As I said earlier, the strong are getting stronger, and our scale is unmatched. In Q2, NIKE generated over 7 billion brand impressions across social platforms globally, directly connecting with consumers on the platforms where they spend their time. For example, our Never Too Far Down film became the number one ad that consumers chose to watch on YouTube during 2020. And these touch points led to over 400 million social engagements. It\u2019s clear, we\u2019re not just reaching our consumers, we\u2019re creating dialogue and opportunities for action that continue to exceed our own internal benchmarks. This deep and meaningful connection has a direct result on NIKE membership. Since the pandemic began, we\u2019ve added more than 70 million new members globally. And we\u2019re deeply focused on the member funnel outcomes, including new member buying, reactivation and retention, and it\u2019s working. Importantly, buying member growth is outpacing new and active member growth, and growth in member demand is outpacing total digital growth. As we drive our membership efforts, we continue to innovate how we serve members. This quarter, NIKE hosted our first-ever globally coordinated Member Days, which demonstrate how we continue to create value for NIKE members. This unique retail moment offers first access to product, rewards for activity, and exclusives across stores and digital. This event reached over 60 million members across 25 countries, driving higher engagement and conversion metrics for the quarter. And in Q2, we once again used the SNKRS App to push digital retail to the next level. SNKRS remains one of NIKE\u2019s greatest competitive advantages, delivering truly innovative features for consumers. For example, this quarter, we launched SNKRS live with our first-ever product drop via live streaming, resulting in a 100% sell-through of the Air Jordan 4 PSG in under 2 minutes. This live streaming capability is now fully launched in both, North America and EMEA, with plans to expand in Japan. Live interaction creates stronger member engagement with NIKE, giving them better access to our best products and experiences. We see so much value here that we opened a brand-new live streaming studio in Greater China just in time for Singles; Day. Simply put, the NIKE brand is strong. We have a scale that\u2019s unparalleled, and the brand is creating meaningful connections everywhere the Swoosh exists. Just look at our results this quarter. Our brand\u2019s power this year has been second to none. Before I wrap up, I want to give a little more context for a number I mentioned earlier, our 80% NIKE Digital growth this quarter. We\u2019ve now had three straight quarters of roughly 80% digital growth. As we\u2019ve said, this growth won\u2019t always be so uniform, but we are growing the pie and taking share from competition. This is the sharp point of our strategy. The consumer shift to digital is permanent, and our digital penetration will only increase in years to come. Across the quarter, our innovation pipeline and brand strength positioned us to continue to navigate a dynamic environment with agility. We have a proven playbook, led by digital. The foundation of this playbook is our commitment to product and consumer connection. The fundamental truth of NIKE is that our innovation and brand strength continue to set the pace. Now, Matt will give you more detail on our playbook, before he does, I\u2019d like to finish by saluting our teams around the globe. Since the start of the pandemic, we\u2019ve said that we would stay on the offense, and the credit for that continued effort and execution goes to our team. Around the world in every facet of our business and our organization, they continue to demonstrate commitment, resilience and creativity. I could not be prouder of everyone on the NIKE team, and I genuinely thank them. And now, I\u2019ll turn things over to Matt. Matt Friend : Thank you, John, and hello, and happy holidays to everyone. As I said in our last call, NIKE is recovering faster, fueled by our unparalleled brand momentum and sharp focus on operational execution. Consumer engagement with our brands continues to grow in frequency and depth through the power of our product franchises and fresh storytelling delivered through improved digital and physical experiences. Our financial results in the second quarter and for the first half of fiscal \u201821 are proof that NIKE has recovered and is moving forward. We have a new consumer offense and a clear vision for how we will engage and serve consumer demand for our brands through digital, leveraging a technology-enabled operating model, which is being built for greater speed, efficiency and effectiveness. While uncertainty due to the global pandemic persists, our teams are now better equipped than ever to navigate through the dynamics we face. We continue to leverage our operational playbook and we learn more every week. Our leadership momentum and trajectory in Greater China is helping to shape decisions we are making around the rest of the world. Our teams are sharply focused on the key metrics that matter most to accelerate the pace of our recovery and return to sustainable, profitable growth. In June, we set clear measures of success for the first half of this fiscal year, and now six months later, we\u2019ve exceeded those goals. Let me share a few of the highlights. We said inventory would return to a healthy and normalized level by the end of Q2. And now, through intentional supply and demand management actions, marketplace health has been restored across all geographies without compromising the value of our brands and product franchises. And NIKE-owned inventory is clean, ending Q2 down 2% versus prior year while delivering 9% revenue growth on a reported basis. We said that digital acceleration brought on by COVID-19 was indicative of a new future marketplace and not a temporary phenomenon. In Q1, we exceeded our digital penetration goal of 30% across owned and partnered, almost three years earlier than planned. Now, in Q2, our momentum continues with 80% NIKE Digital revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis. And we increased our digital penetration further by improving product availability through search optimization, moving inventory across marketplace channels and increasing digital fulfillment capacity through scale and automation. We said we would tightly manage costs. And in the first half of fiscal \u201821, SG&A declined 6% versus prior year. Over the course of the last six months, we have reduced discretionary spending in non-priority areas while accelerating investment to support our digital transformation and realigning our organization through a new consumer construct. And finally, we said our product pipeline would remain robust. And you\u2019ve seen us continue a consistent flow of innovation and new storytelling around our most important product franchises. This has translated into deep consumer engagement with our brands and market share gains, driving first half revenue growth of 4% versus the prior year. Simply put, we have executed on our plan, and NIKE is now even better positioned to compete and serve consumers than prior to the pandemic. Now, as we look ahead to the second half of fiscal \u201821 and beyond, I want to share some perspective on how we will strategically and financially manage the Company. You\u2019ve heard me talk about these principles before, and I will continue to reiterate them as we execute against our strategy and transform our business. First and foremost, despite the short-term uncertainty, we are managing the business and making decisions for the long term. Consumer interest in sport, fitness, health and wellness has never been greater. And NIKE\u2019s market opportunity is as large as ever. While short-term consumer demand may continue to be impacted, we are focused on moving faster against the most important elements to position NIKE for the long term, deepening relationships our three brands have with consumers; scaling direct connections with contactable members; expanding capabilities to manage a rapidly growing digital business; and transforming and elevating the marketplace. Second, we will continue to optimize supply and demand with speed and agility, maintaining healthy inventory levels and increasing full price realization. Capabilities like Express Lane now operationalized in all four geographies and representing almost 20% of our total business enables increased flexibility and responsiveness in serving consumer demand while driving higher profitability. Third, we will capitalize on the relative speed of our recovery and our financial strength by accelerating investment levels from the first half. Our investment priorities will be focused on a few key areas. We will begin to rebuild investment in demand creation, activating against major sports moments, athletes and innovation, and expanding the reach and impact of significant growth opportunities in women\u2019s, apparel, digital and our Jordan Brand. We expect demand creation as a percentage of revenue will gradually increase versus recent quarters, although new capabilities and a member-focused digital marketing model will enable greater return on investment over time. We will create a digital-first supply chain, built on a strong technology and analytics foundation, in order to optimize service, cost, convenience and sustainability. We already see return on our investments in North America, where we ramped up our new regional service center in Los Angeles to serve peak holiday demand, aided by capabilities from our Celect acquisition. As a result, we delivered over 100% NIKE Digital revenue growth in Q2 in North America while lowering digital fulfillment cost per unit versus the prior year. We will accelerate the technology enablement of our operating model to change the speed with which we directly engage with and serve the consumer from online to offline services, digital marketing, personalization and digital supply and demand management. In North America, we leveraged new tools to make dynamic pricing decisions during Black Friday. We also continue to scale RFID capabilities across our stores in EMEA, enabling better product allocation and replenishment, and we began testing consumer-facing RFID capabilities like self-checkout in our stores in Korea. In the marketplace, we will increase the pace of opening new stores as we create an elevated, differentiated and digitally connected experience for our consumers. In Q2 alone, we opened two Nike Live and six Nike Unite stores, which is our next-generation factory store concept. And we plan to open an additional 30 stores in the second half of this fiscal year and even more in fiscal year \u201822, enabling accelerated growth in women\u2019s, digital and apparel. And finally, we will drive strong free cash flow growth and consistent balance sheet management as we target leverage down towards pre-pandemic levels. We recently announced a 12% increase in our annual dividend, and when appropriate, will resume share repurchase activity. The underlying benefits from our business shift towards NIKE Digital and NIKE Direct are becoming increasingly clear, and these principles will enable us to move faster towards our long-term strategic vision of Consumer Direct Acceleration. Now, let\u2019s turn to the details of our second quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 9% in Q2, up 7% on a currency-neutral basis as NIKE Direct grew 30%, led by strong NIKE Digital growth of 80% and partially offset by declines in our wholesale business. Gross margin decreased 90 basis points in Q2 versus the prior year, resulting from higher promotional activity to reduce excess inventories. Performance in the quarter was impacted by nonrecurring costs associated with the organizational realignment, which reduced gross margin by approximately 30 basis points. SG&A declined 2% in the quarter as disciplined expense management and lower marketing spend on brand and sports events was partially offset by increased investments in digital marketing. This quarter, SG&A was also negatively impacted by approximately $135 million of nonrecurring costs associated with the organizational realignment. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.1% compared to 10.7% for the same period last year, primarily due to changes in our earnings mix and an increase in tax associated with recently finalized U.S. tax regulations and increased benefits from stock compensation. Second quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.78, up 11% versus the prior year. With that, let\u2019s turn to our operating segments. In North America, Q2 revenue grew 1% and includes non-comparable items in the prior year, such as the sale of Hurley and the transition of our NFL license business to Fanatics. And Q2 EBIT increased 17% on a reported basis. Q2 provided more clear evidence on the state of our marketplace transformation and shift in channel mix. Despite a 14% decline in wholesale revenue and traffic in NIKE-owned stores remaining well below prior year levels, North America was able to grow 1% overall due to more than 100% growth in NIKE Digital. NIKE Digital now represents nearly 25% of our North America business, and it continues to serve a broader consumer base. In Q2, Member Days drove records for weekly member metrics and engagement with strong NIKE Digital performance in women\u2019s, apparel and sub-$100 product, all areas of significant growth opportunity. Within wholesale, we continue to shift the marketplace towards differentiated retail. And to give you some context on our progress leading up to the pandemic, over the last three years, we have reduced the number of undifferentiated accounts in North America by roughly 30%, while still delivering mid-single-digit growth on average. And in Q2, as we managed product supply in response to the pandemic, we took further steps towards account and channel consolidation by reprioritizing product allocations to benefit our strategic partners and NIKE Direct. As a result, undifferentiated wholesale revenue declined at an even faster rate compared to total wholesale. Looking forward, over the next two years, we will more aggressively accelerate change with larger undifferentiated accounts as we and our strategic partners together reprofile the shape of the marketplace and recapture short-term demand dislocation. In EMEA, Q2 revenue grew 12% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT grew 29% on a reported basis. Despite a resurgence of COVID-19 and lockdown restrictions in November, EMEA continued to drive momentum in Q2 through strong weekly sales growth and a higher full price realization. NIKE Direct grew 25% on a currency-neutral basis, and wholesale grew 6% in the quarter, led by strong double-digit strategic partner growth in JD Sports and Zalando, partially offset by double-digit declines in undifferentiated wholesale. NIKE Digital grew nearly 100% driven by Cyber Week that broke records across revenue and member engagement. In our NIKE-owned stores, we continued expansion of services to consumers. We piloted virtual expert sessions at NikeTown London, driving increases in conversion and basket size with plans to scale this capability across EMEA. And we utilized digital queuing and additional self-checkout options to improve the consumer experience and safety. Our Express Lane offense in EMEA once again drove significant growth in Q2, increasing more than 30% versus the prior year. This is a key enabler to navigating the current environment through a more flexible inventory strategy. We lowered futures bookings for holiday and leveraged Express Lane to replenish inventory on a significantly shorter lead time and responding to current retail trends. And with the recent lockdown measures announced this week, we will be agile in managing ongoing uncertainty by leveraging our operational playbook. With that, let\u2019s turn to Greater China, which achieved its first $2 billion quarter and grew an incredible 19% on a currency-neutral basis in Q2 with EBIT growth of 28% on a reported basis. As John mentioned earlier, Singles\u2019 Day drove significant growth in the quarter with over $0.5 billion in digital demand. In order to fulfill the record level of orders, we implemented several initiatives to maximize flexibility and responsiveness in our supply chain. From enabling multi-node network fulfillment to employing robot delivery and green packaging, the Greater China team was prepared to deliver on elevated consumer expectations. And it paid off as we shipped out all units within 48 hours and delivered nearly half with same-day or next-day delivery. And digital wasn\u2019t the only growth driver across greater China. Every marketplace channel grew versus last year, including year-over-year growth in traffic in our NIKE-owned stores, the first quarter to achieve this since the start of the pandemic, all while continuing to expand conversion rates versus the prior year. Finally, in our APLA geography, Q2 revenue grew 5% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT grew 12% on a reported basis. NIKE Digital grew more than 90% on a currency-neutral basis as we significantly expanded our digital footprint with the local launch of Nike.com in Mexico and through key digital partnerships across Mexico, Japan and Southeast Asia. We opened the first Nike Unite store globally in Korea, and this generated the highest revenue in the first 10 days of any NIKE store opening ever. Nearly 90% of transactions were linked to a member, and it\u2019s indicative of the broader engagement we are seeing across the geography and the strength of our membership offense. In December, we successfully transitioned our business in Brazil to a strategic distributor model in partnership with Grupo SBF, the largest sporting goods retailer in Brazil and across Latin America. We look forward to continuing to serve our consumers in Brazil through a more efficient and profitable operating model. That being said, NIKE and Grupo Axo have mutually agreed to terminate the sale and purchase agreement for the transition of NIKE\u2019s business in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay. We will continue to own and operate the businesses in this region in the near term, while we assess future prospects to move to a distributor model in all three countries. I will now turn to our financial outlook. Fiscal \u201821 continues to be dynamic, including a new wave of government restrictions implemented across Europe and parts of North America. We remain focused on what we can control, deepening our consumer connections while we manage risk and uncertainty in this challenging environment. We are tightly buying inventory and are focused on ensuring the long-term health of all of our brands and product franchises. With that in mind, we are increasing our full year outlook for revenue and now expect low teens growth versus the prior year. In the second half, we will continue to take a cautious approach to supply and demand to maintain healthy marketplace inventory amidst continued uncertainty and to ensure that we set a strong foundation for growth and profitability in fiscal year \u201822 and beyond. Our gross margin outlook is also improving with stronger than planned return to normalized inventory levels and lower than expected markdown activity across our portfolio. For the full year, we now expect gross margin to expand up to 50 basis points versus the prior year, including 35 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. We expect to continue to see quarterly sequential improvement with Q3 gross margin expansion to be roughly flat versus the prior year. For the full year, we expect SG&A will now grow low single digits, driven by increased variable costs associated with our improved revenue outlook as well as amplified investment in demand creation to further strengthen our brands and drive higher member engagement. Across gross margin and SG&A, we continue to expect approximately $315 million of nonrecurring execution costs associated with simplifying our organizational structure, of which approximately $220 million was incurred in the first half of this fiscal year. And last, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens range, reflecting an increase in tax associated with finalized U.S. tax regulations. NIKE is navigating the current environment with an even clearer vision of our brand\u2019s long-term future, along with a sharp focus of near-term and long-term priorities. The team is highly engaged and executing with the passion to win. While we expect continued volatility in the short term due to the pandemic, a faster first half recovery has mitigated the largest operational risks. We are now better positioned to accelerate investment in our business and create even greater competitive separation as we pursue our full potential with consumers around the world. I could not be more excited about the future. With that, let\u2019s open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Your line is open. Adrienne Yih : Good afternoon. And congratulations on the progress, really nice to see the inventory ahead of plan. So, just sticking with that thematic on inventory. I was wondering if you can talk about the quality or the mix of the inventory entering this next quarter. Are the promotional aspects of it behind, were they -- was the promotional piece of the business in the sub-$100 category, or were there any characteristics that we can glean from the promotional activity? And then, as you look forward to the inflection, sort of the global reopening, how are you thinking about the capacity to chase inventory, particularly in the high heat product? Thank you very much. Matt Friend : Sure, Adrienne, and thanks for your question. As a starting point, as we mentioned several quarters ago, our focus has been on managing supply and demand. And we talked specifically about our focus of trying to normalize inventory by the end of the second quarter. And so, the work that we\u2019ve done around the world, not only to cut supply but also to work with our marketplace partners and to try to capture and drive demand over these past six months has been significant in order to be able to put us in this position that we\u2019re in today. I mentioned in my remarks that we\u2019ve seen markdown levels, which continue to be worse than the prior year, but better than we had anticipated and better broadly than what we\u2019re seeing across the rest of the marketplace, indicative of the strength of our brand. And so, as we finish this quarter, the health of our inventory and the health of the inventory across the broader marketplace is exactly where we were hoping for it to be. As we look forward, we\u2019re obviously still in the midst of a pandemic. And so, I\u2019ve said a couple of quarters in a row now that we continue to take a cautious approach to supply and demand management as we look at the second half. We\u2019re still in a pandemic, and we know things won\u2019t be linear until we see the pandemic and the virus under control or contained. And so, what we\u2019ve been focused on is ensuring that we protect the value of our brands and our product franchises, and ensure that we set the Company up for healthy growth and profitability in fiscal year \u201822 and for the years after that. So, that\u2019s really been what\u2019s guiding our approach. I did mention the Express Lane in my remarks, and it\u2019s a tool that we\u2019ve been using around the world that\u2019s almost 20% of our business today. It\u2019s not equally 20% across every geo. It\u2019s largest in EMEA, as we\u2019ve been talking about for several quarters. And it\u2019s absolutely a useful tool for us that we continue to intend to use to grow as a larger portion of our business but also as a really critical lever to be able to manage supply and demand as we\u2019re reading the marketplace on a weekly basis. So, that\u2019s going to end up being a critical component of our future as we look forward in a much more responsive way than the way we\u2019ve been able to operate in the past. As far as High Heat product and those things, we\u2019re managing those styles and those franchises the same way we manage the rest of our franchises. And so, we continue to have plans, and we use those as great tools to create brand energy in the marketplace, but also to give consumers what they love. And we\u2019re not managing those franchises any differently than we would manage any other franchises in this time. We\u2019re managing them for the long term, and that\u2019s what we will intend to do in the second half. Operator : Our next question is from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Your line is open. Bob Drbul : I guess, the first question that I have, I guess, when considering the call date, what were the gating factors between choosing Friday evening or Saturday morning? John Donahoe : Well, we called to your assistant and we asked her whether -- when you would be most available, and she thought that this would be a better time. Bob Drbul : Always, I wouldn\u2019t miss it, wouldn\u2019t miss it. So, I guess, the other question that I have is, can you -- in Europe specifically, the play between some of the lockdowns in the various countries and your digital and your bricks-and-mortar, can you just talk about how that\u2019s really materializing? And if you could maybe just talk through a little bit here in the U.S., what you\u2019re seeing in some of the markets where the virus is spreading and impacting the stores over the last few weeks? Thanks. Matt Friend : Sure, Bob. So, what I would say is, is that the situation has been dynamic since March. And we\u2019ve watched wave after wave of the pandemic hit different markets and different time lines around the world. And really, the only marketplace where we\u2019ve seen continued sort of trajectory in terms of managing the virus has been China. But we expect the marketplace to continue to be pretty dynamic. I think, I mentioned that we\u2019re seeing waves of more restrictions happening across Europe and in parts of the U.S. And we\u2019re expecting that the situation is going to continue to be unique here as we finish the holiday season and enter into the later part of winter. However, we are looking at and have raised our guidance to low-teens revenue growth because we feel like the momentum that we have, the brand strength and the playbook that we\u2019re employing is giving us confidence that we can continue to manage through this. As it specifically relates to what we\u2019re seeing now, our retail sales across the marketplace for holiday have continued to track very well versus the prior year. But in Europe, where we\u2019re seeing more restrictions of shutdowns, physical retail continues to be the area where we\u2019re seeing the largest impact. Stores continue to open and close on different cadences. They have to manage through traffic capacity constraints. And at this point in time, as of today, about 80% of our stores are open in EMEA, but many of them are still operating under modified and/or reduced hours. So, the situation is dynamic, to say the least. We\u2019re also watching carefully potential bottlenecks in the supply chain. And to-date, we\u2019ve been able to continue to meet EDDs with consumers on our digital business. And we\u2019re leveraging the relationships that we have with carriers and otherwise in order to manage our business through this time. But, it\u2019s definitely something that we\u2019re watching, Bob, and it\u2019s dynamic. I guess, where I\u2019d probably finish is just to say that we know the path isn\u2019t going to be linear, and we\u2019ve been saying that for several quarters. But, we think we\u2019re better positioned at this point to manage through the uncertainty probably than we were prior to the pandemic. We\u2019ve learned so much over the last nine months. And the way that we\u2019re operating as a team gives us a lot of confidence that we can continue to manage through this. And as I said earlier, we\u2019re just -- we\u2019re focused on setting a strong foundation for growth and profitability in fiscal year \u201822 and beyond. And so, we\u2019re making decisions in the midst of the uncertainty here to do that and to position ourselves to accelerate once the pandemic is behind us. John Donahoe : And Matt, maybe two things I\u2019d just add on. One is just a shout out to our stores, our direct team and our stores team who have just been -- just amazing through this period of the open-close, open-close. Our store athletes, our frontline store athletes, our entire stores team and our supply chain and distribution team, they have been sort of the unsung heroes I think through what has been a very dynamic time. And as Matt said, while we\u2019re opening and closing physical retail, digital is open 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. And what\u2019s fascinating to watch is the consistency of the growth across digital. And so, I think there\u2019s -- we have increasing evidence that when a consumer wants to get something, if physical retail is closed, they\u2019re coming to us digitally, and our ability to reach consumers digitally in a variety of manners is just getting better and better as this pandemic goes on. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Binetti : Hey guys. Thanks for all the detail here today and taking our questions, and congrats on a nice quarter. On -- I want to ask you, John, on North America, on wholesale. I think you mentioned -- or I guess, Matt, you mentioned down 14% in the quarter, a bit of a deceleration from last quarter. And you did talk about accelerating the strategy and transforming the end markets, but I know there was a very purposeful focus on getting the inventories aligned. So, I\u2019m curious, as you look at the North America wholesale outlook, is second quarter -- is it smart to think that that might be the peak of the pullback in the near term and that drag gets a little better from here with the inventories more aligned, or would you say that to think about it still being down at that level as you go forward as you kind of keep working on the marketplace? Matt Friend : Sure, Michael. I\u2019ll take that. And then, John, if there\u2019s anything you want to layer in here, please do. Yes. So overall, wholesale was down 14% in the quarter, and we referenced that we had to make some real-time decisions in the quarter in order to address the realities of the situation in the marketplace. And I think in the last call, I said something along the lines of -- or maybe it was two calls ago, I said something along the lines of, as we were adjusting forward-looking supply, we took a more aggressive action in North America because we did not believe the recovery curve in North America was going to look the same is what we expected to see in China, Asia or even in Europe, given the way that we were seeing differences in response to the -- different countries\u2019 response to the virus. And so, when we got close to the second quarter and into the second quarter, we had to make some decisions about how to allocate that inventory, and we focused it on our strategic partners and serving consumer demand through NIKE Direct. And so, we saw a greater reduction in undifferentiated wholesale. As we look forward, we\u2019re going to be more aggressive in adjusting our plans with undifferentiated wholesale. But, what I would tell you is, is that we believe that we and our partners are very well-positioned to capture demand that gets dislocated from changing the profile and the shape of the marketplace. And so, I think looking at this quarter, I think this quarter was more indicative of the way we manage supply and demand in the face of the pandemic and the challenges that that created in the short term versus it\u2019s an indication of trend for that line of channel of business. Okay? But, as we look forward, we are going to be more aggressive with larger undifferentiated customers that we have been working with. And we\u2019re working closely with our strategic wholesale partners in a city-by-city, mall-by-mall, street-by-street basis to work together to determine how we\u2019re going to recapture that demand. And that\u2019s absolutely our plan because we believe longer term, as we\u2019ve said before, we believe that a premium, consistent experience for consumers across the marketplace connected to digital is the type of market foundation that we think we need as a premium brand to create and to be the foundation for long-term growth in the North America marketplace. Michael Binetti : Can I just follow that with a question on China? And it\u2019s nice to see the margin -- the EBIT margin there return back to expansion in the quarter. Some of our work suggests there\u2019s quite a bit of inflation in that market in areas like freight, but more so in marketing and CAC digital, customer acquisition cost. Does the top line trajectory there offset a lot of that inflation? Are the prior peak margins that we saw in that market still attainable, or is it -- do you feel like that market, more appropriate to focus on profit dollar growth and margin expansion back to historic levels as we kind of come past COVID here? Matt Friend : Yes. I mean, it\u2019s a great question. And as we\u2019ve been working our way out of COVID in China, the thing that we\u2019re just reminded of is how large of a market opportunity that is for us, and we continue to see it again this quarter. We\u2019re not able to meet the full demand that we see in that China marketplace. And we continue to see the strength of our brand increasing quarter after quarter after quarter. I think that as it relates to cost, we\u2019ve been in a really high -- we\u2019ve been driving -- and forgive me for forgetting the number, but in the 10s, the 20s of quarters of double-digit growth in that Greater China marketplace, and we\u2019ve done it while maintaining a very strong profit profile. So, what you saw over the last two quarters was more indicative of us working through the dynamics in China with inventory and those things as a result of managing through COVID versus there being an underlying theme of profit erosion long term. I think, we believe that the China marketplace continues to be a great opportunity for us. And we manage the business top to bottom, Michael. So, we\u2019re looking at pricing. We\u2019re consistently looking at opportunities to grow the business in dimensions where we have less of share. But, we\u2019re really pleased to see the growth in our market share in that marketplace, and we believe that profits will continue to grow at an accelerated rate over time. John Donahoe : Matt, what I\u2019d just add on to that is the strength of our brand in China, both NIKE and Jordan, very, very strong. And I think that is partly what\u2019s driving the share gain there. Operator : Our next question is from Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Kimberly Greenberger : Okay, great. Thank you so much. That digital growth is really impressive and sustaining at such a high level consistently. I\u2019m wondering do you think that\u2019s a function of just the additional digital touch points you\u2019ve acquired this year or a more savvy digital marketing strategy. I\u2019m just wondering if you could hypothesize about some of the drivers there. And, when you take a look at that digital P&L, I think, you mentioned over 100% growth, for example, here in North America or in the U.S., helped by the new LA regional service center. Are you hitting the point where you\u2019re starting to see a sort of inflection in your incremental margins in that business, either for scale or because of some of the unlocks, like in that regional service center? John Donahoe : Matt, maybe why don\u2019t I take the first part of Kimberly\u2019s question and you take the second? Matt Friend : Sounds good. John Donahoe : So, Kimberly, yes, our digital business has been experiencing tremendous growth, 80% globally, 100% in the U.S. Our Nike App grew 200%. Our Nike mobile app grew 200% this quarter. And I think what\u2019s underlying that is that digital is the new normal in consumer behavior, and we believe the trends that we\u2019re seeing are here to stay. In fact, as we\u2019ve said now in a couple of quarters, we believe that we\u2019ve well passed the 30% of our overall business, and we think it will be more in the range of 50% in the near future. And it\u2019s an area we have a clear lead. When you ask about what\u2019s driving it, again, we go back to a simple mindset, through the eyes of the consumer, which is consumers want to get what they want, when they want it, how they want it. And that means, obviously, great digital experiences mobiley, through our apps, SNKRS and others online, but also consumers actually, they don\u2019t differentiate digital and physical in the same way they used to. So, they may want to buy online, pick up on store. They might buy online, have it shipped from store. They may want to go try it on and then have it shipped home. And so, we are driving our digital transformation end-to-end, right? So, yes, it\u2019s impacting our digital experiences. No doubt that\u2019s getting better and better and better where it\u2019s better searched, better -- the digital experiences are getting better each quarter. I\u2019ll come back to membership, which I think is key. As Matt said, we\u2019re building out our stores, working with our strategic partners that offer that consistent, seamless experience that consumers expect. And frankly, the supply chain, don\u2019t underestimate the impact of this digital on translating our supply chain. Matt talked about we\u2019ve done in Greater China. 300% increase in digital fulfillment capacity in North America, 400% in EMEA. Robots played a huge role. Over 1 million boxes shipped by robots and the productivity that comes with that. So to be a great digital company, you\u2019ve got to be end-to-end. But I would say, if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019d highlight is the backbone\u2019s membership, right, having a direct connection with consumers. And we are growing our membership. And it\u2019s simple. How do we bring more people into the top of the funnel and establish a direct connection with them? How do we engage them? Engage them through engaging, whether it\u2019s NIKE Running Club, NIKE Training Club, SNKRS app, live streaming is a way to engage consumers. And what we know is more engaged consumers buy more. And one of the most, I think, exciting things we saw in the quarter was these Member Days where it\u2019s really the first time we have really targeted our members, provided more personal recommendations. We\u2019ve allocated scarce product for them, offered them first access. And the conversion rates were very impressive. And so, I think this is a virtuous cycle that we get better and better at the whole membership funnel, the full funnel that we can have a more direct connection with consumers, we can offer more personalized and targeted offerings. I think, the opportunity to expand with women digitally is significant. So, it\u2019s no one thing. And I learned this from my days in the digital world. It\u2019s a lot of little things that make a difference to be a great digital company. And we\u2019re a clear leader here. I think, we\u2019re extending our market share lead digitally and we\u2019re going to continue doubling down. Matt, do you want to take the second piece of Kimberly\u2019s question? Matt Friend : Yes, sure. I\u2019ll just jump in on the second piece. I guess, what I\u2019d say, Kimberly, is your question specifically about the regional service center, John sort of hit it, I mean, our focus at the start is capacity. We needed more capacity because we were watching demand shift rapidly to digital. And so, not only did we open that regional service center in LA, but we leverage omnichannel capabilities in our existing distribution centers in order to be able to do the 300% or 400% increase in volume that John referenced to fuel that business. As I think about the impact on the financial model, and I\u2019ve probably said this a couple of times before, but I\u2019ll use a frame that John just used, getting consumers what they want, where they want and how they want. We\u2019re investing in technology and the supply chain so that we can better predict where to put inventory, where we think consumers want the inventory. And the benefits for us in that are in gross margin. It\u2019s more full price realization. It\u2019s lower cost to fulfill. And frankly, it\u2019s better for the environment because it\u2019s less shipping and it\u2019s less moving stuff around. So, it\u2019s better. We\u2019re investing in technology to create O-to-O capabilities in the marketplace. And while we don\u2019t have the largest store footprint today that -- relative to maybe pure vertical retailers, we are investing in stores with the intentionality of having stores in more places with O-to-O capabilities with capabilities like buy online, pick up in store; more pickup points; shipping from store; shipping to store, so that we can serve that demand more closely to consumers, again, lower cost, better for the environment, better sustainability. And then, I guess, the last thing I\u2019d probably hit on, and John referenced it vis-\u00e0-vis member days and the member funnel, we\u2019re spending -- we\u2019re investing a lot of money in digital marketing today. But the marketing -- the opportunity that we see with greater acknowledgment of who our consumers are and how they shop across the marketplace is more personalization and it\u2019s a greater return on those marketing dollars because we\u2019re moving deeper into the funnel. We know who those consumers are. And we have the ability to react and reengage them at a lower cost to us or a lower acquisition cost, which should improve, either create leverage in our demand creation over time and/or enable us to use the dollars that we\u2019re using to drive a greater revenue plan. So, those are some of the things that we\u2019re excited about. Those are -- are we seeing the fruit of it today? We\u2019re starting to. But what you are seeing, Kimberly, is we can see more clearly though where the biggest pockets of opportunity are. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused and that\u2019s where we\u2019re investing to create capability, so that we can drive these outcomes as we look several years out. So, this is where we\u2019re focused as a team. And it\u2019s what\u2019s going to fuel our financial model over the next several years. Operator : Our last question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Paul Trussell : Happy holidays, and great team quarter, team. John Donahoe : Thanks, Paul. Paul Trussell : I wanted to ask about margins. Maybe a little bit more detail and color on the factors impacting both GPM and SG&A, both in terms of the second quarter and also your second half guidance. In particular, I would love to hear a little bit more about demand creation, which was obviously down double digits this quarter, and sounds like it\u2019s going to inflect up a bit, and then, also the profile of profitability of your DTC and digital business, right? Obviously, that\u2019s accretive. But certainly, to the extent that you are scaling obviously meaningfully on the top line, and also earlier, you highlighted that you\u2019re finding ways to reduce per unit fulfillment cost. I\u2019m just wondering to what extent is that channel\u2019s margins actually seeing improvement overall. Thank you. John Donahoe : Now, Matt, that is a great last simple question for the year. And I\u2019m going to give you full permission to answer that in a very concise manner. Matt Friend : Well, I guess, where I\u2019d start, Paul, is when we look at our margins in the second quarter, we\u2019re very-pleased with where gross margin performance landed. We said gross margin in the short-term would be more of a function of how we manage supply and demand. And so, we were more focused on the quality and health of our franchises and restoring inventory levels. And that\u2019s ultimately what drove -- that\u2019s ultimately what drove our operating plan for the last six months. We\u2019re probably even more so pleased with the speed of recovery because it puts us in a position now where we can look forward and say, how do we want to manage the business as we move forward. And as I said earlier today, we\u2019re incredibly focused on the things that are required in order for us to achieve that vision of Consumer Direct Acceleration. So, as we look ahead, our gross margins are going to be roughly flat is what our guidance is for the third quarter. And that\u2019s another quarter of sequential improvement in margin. That\u2019s being driven by a higher full price mix in the third quarter and lower discount activity. And that\u2019s going to be offset to some degree by factory store liquidation that we talked about last quarter, where we\u2019re still planning for more markdowns in that specific channel. Because we continue to see traffic lagging behind the prior year in that specific channel, so that we can keep conversion rates up. In the third quarter, I should also say that we\u2019re going to -- we\u2019re expecting to see about 55 basis points of FX headwinds. So, we had about 30 per quarter in the first two quarters of this year, and we\u2019re expecting 55 basis points in Q3. And so, FX adjusted, the margin looks even better, sequentially. And what I\u2019d say maybe as just a little side point on this is that we think third quarter will end up being the trough on FX for us. So, we started to see benefits in translation on the top line. But FX has continued to be a headwind in EBIT through the second quarter, will be through the third quarter, and it will lessen as we get into the fourth quarter. And then, that\u2019s where we expect to start to see some inflection from a weaker U.S. dollar and strong growth outside the U.S. So, I think that\u2019s probably where I\u2019ll stop. And I know our team can follow-up with you with more questions specifically on the modeling. But, thanks, and happy holidays. Andy Muir : Thank you, Paul. John, were you going to say something? John Donahoe : Just, Andy, Matt and I and Andy want to extend happy holidays to everyone on the call. Thank you for doing the call on a Friday afternoon. Hopefully, this frees up a little of your holiday week next week. And please, everyone, have a very safe and happy holiday. And thanks again to all the NIKE teammates around the world for incredible teamwork, resilience and commitment this year. Happy holidays. Andy Muir : Thank you, all.

Now, I would like to turn the call over to Andy Muir, VP Investor Relations. Andy Muir : Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE, Inc.\u2019s fiscal 2021 third quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today\u2019s call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago or at our website, investors.nike.com. Joining us on today\u2019s call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe and our Chief Financial Officer, Matt Friend. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to one. In the event, you have additional questions that are not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I will now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe. John Donahoe : Thank you, Andy and hello to everyone on today\u2019s call. First and foremost, like all companies around the world, we\u2019re pleased by the recent positive news of the vaccine rollout. We remain optimistic though we\u2019re prepared to operate through continued volatility until the virus is fully contained. Our teams have proven their agility to operate through uncertainty while also staying focused on the long term, and we once again demonstrated that agility in Q3. It\u2019s why I wouldn\u2019t trade our position with anyone. The power of NIKE is our consistency and the strength of our global portfolio. Throughout the pandemic, we have stayed focused on our unique advantages, and we\u2019ve been resolute in fueling innovation and our brand is as strong as ever. I am proud of our results this quarter. Q3 saw us continue to deliver consumers new products, new campaigns, the energy from our roster of athletes and more. Our strategy puts the member at the center and keeps us in the lead, and we will continue to drive even further competitive separation. And still, we push our own expectations of ourselves. Last week, we released our 2020 Impact Report and announced our new 2025 Purpose Targets. Our new 5-year purpose targets offer a road map to 2025, outlining clear goals, action plans, and accountability. And for the first time, that accountability now includes linking executive compensation to our Purpose Goals. Our 2025 targets will keep us focused on accelerating our efforts against a wide range of priorities, from sustainability to representation to investing in the future of sport in communities around the world. I encourage everyone to take a look at the report at purpose.nike.com. Ultimately, this isn\u2019t just the right thing to do. It makes great business sense. Setting purpose targets for ourselves creates long-term value, raises the bar for our industry, and redefines our own potential for a positive impact in the world. Our commitment to constant improvement is why I continue to be so amazed by this team. I have never been more confident in our leadership and teams around the world as we stay on the offense accelerating our long-term strategy. And as I said, this continues to be a dynamic external environment, but I am proud how adaptable NIKE is. No matter what happens, COVID spikes, forced enclosed \u2013 store closures, port congestion on the West Coast, and more, this team responds with solutions. We adjust and we win. Our brand continues to deeply connect all over the world. We remain consumers\u2019 number one favorite brand in all 12 of our key cities in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s businesses. We\u2019re also seeing particularly strong connections in Greater China where our strong portfolio of brands, including Jordan and Converse, is helping to extend our leadership position. All over the world, the relationships we have with consumers cannot easily be replicated. Our brand differentiates us driven by the unique competitive advantages that we enjoy. First, NIKE\u2019s connections with consumers are driven by sport and cultural authenticity. Our roster of athletes is the greatest in the world. Naomi Osaka continues to emerge as a truly global sport icon having won 4 Grand Slam titles at only 23 years old. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 became the youngest footballer ever to score 25 Champions League goals, leading Paris Saint-Germain into the quarterfinals. The NBA All-Star Game has proved yet again of our dominance in basketball with Lebron\u2019s team taking on KD\u2019s, Giannis winning MVP, and a young core of Jordan Brand superstars led by Zion and Luka. And the energy of March Madness tips off today with Jordan and NIKE schools making up 10 of the top 16 women\u2019s teams and 15 of the top 16 men\u2019s teams. No brand connects with consumers with the power and culture of sport like NIKE, and we pride ourselves on our leadership role to drive hope and inspiration all over the world. Second, our brand is powered by our global scale. This is particularly critical advantage as we continue to fuel our digital transformation. We\u2019ve had tremendous success in digital, quickly pivoting to serve consumers as they shift to digital channels, but even as this consumer shift is felt across industries, NIKE\u2019s digital transformation remains a unique advantage. Scale matters. The strength of our brand allows us to stay personal at scale with consumers in all of our geographies. And more than ever, the portfolio effect of being a truly global brand is powerful. Third, we stay at the front of the pack, thanks to our compelling consumer experiences. Last quarter, we announced the launch of SNKRS Live, our first product drop via live streaming. In Q3, we doubled the number of countries with live streaming, adding Japan, Germany, and Italy. We\u2019re seeing phenomenal engagement for this live interaction with average viewing duration doubling to over 15 minutes, I wish it were 15 years, well above the industry norms. We\u2019re also creating content to connect members to the sport and sneaker community, content that drives the highest engagement on sneakers. So, whether it\u2019s through the SNKRS App, our Activity apps, platforms like TikTok and more, we continue to find compelling ways to deliver an authentic NIKE experience in digital. And fourth, the Jordan Brand had a very strong quarter growing double digits in Q3. This growth was broad-based, led by our biggest growth opportunities : digital, international, apparel, and women\u2019s. In fact, Jordan\u2019s women\u2019s business was up nearly triple digits, a strong statement of how the brand continues to serve a broader set of consumers. Q3 also saw the launch of the Air Jordan 11 Jubilee, one of the largest and most successful footwear launches ever with more than $175 million in revenue. We are incredibly confident about the continued growth opportunity for the Jordan Brand moving forward. As always, our brand is propelled by our unmatched innovation, investment, and pipeline. Innovation\u2019s at our core, reflecting not just our foundational values, but the values we share with consumers. We don\u2019t just innovate for the elite athlete. We use innovation and design to solve problems for all consumers no matter their sport or style of play. And we consistently bring fresh new product to market, supported by compelling storytelling that helps drive consumer demand. At the core of our innovation engine is our edge in performance, and we continue to use this edge to evolve some of the most popular products for everyday runners. This quarter, we focused on a key problem for runners with new footwear that continues our mission to unlock injury prevention. The ZoomX Invincible Run offers a brand-new look for Nike Running with increased foam in the midsole. This creates a soft ride that makes running feel easy with incredible energy return and is designed to help reduce running-related injuries. We also just launched the React Escape, a shoe specifically designed for the female runner. The React Escape\u2019s silhouette, materials, and design details are all aimed at new runners, and it\u2019s seeing great sell-through as it encourages more women to pick up the sport. We are also driving our sustainability agenda through strong product innovation. We\u2019ve set ambitious goals around the use of sustainable materials throughout our line and we\u2019ll continue to invest in new materials and methods of make to maintain our leadership position here. Last month, we launched Cosmic Unity, our first performance shoe under Our Move to Zero initiative. This initiative, which moves us towards zero waste and zero carbon, embraces circular design as a guiding principle. Cosmic Unity, which has also been already been worn on court by some of the NBA\u2019s best, including Anthony Davis, is NIKE\u2019s first performance shoe made out of at least 25% recycled content by weight and offers just a hint of our future with sustainable product. We are also resolute in our pursuit of making sport a daily habit for all athletes. A great example of this work is the Nike Go FlyEase. Its easy-on, easy-off design solves for an ambitious North Star, the creation of a truly hands-free shoe. This is a shoe for everyone, from elite athletes to parents with their hands full. We\u2019re initially launching Nike Go FlyEase first for our most engaged members with broader consumer availability coming later this year. And we continue to push our industry in creating product through better consumer insights. This quarter, we acquired Datalogue, a data integration platform that will help us process, analyze and act on the data we enjoy, thanks to our scale advantage. This lets us harness the full power of our data, turning it into more actionable insights and enabling greater speed. As part of our recent organizational realignment, we also put our data teams alongside the creative teams to unlock this opportunity. NIKE has always married the art and science of product creation and the move towards deeper and more dynamic insights, along with our talent and investments in data science and machine learning, creates a capacity that no other brand has. Let\u2019s quickly talk about the Tokyo Olympics and Para Olympics. Despite the unique circumstances surrounding the games, we look forward to leveraging that world stage to showcase our innovation and purpose commitments. Our pipeline and cadence has continued its pace, including some new innovations and the scaling of a few of our recent innovation platforms. This summer in Tokyo, we look forward to sharing the next-generation of FlyEase and its mission of inclusive innovation, as well as delivering some new and exciting women-specific innovations. The last thing I\u2019d like to discuss is digital. We\u2019re taking even greater advantage of our vast digital opportunity as we create the future of retail. We know that our consumers want a consistent, seamless and premium experience. And so alongside our strategic partners, we continue to consolidate the marketplace to give our consumers that premium experience. Our owned digital business is thriving, with growth of 54% on a currency-neutral basis during the quarter. This growth was led by North America, which had its first-ever quarter with $1 billion in digital revenue. As you know, we set a bold vision for digital across owned and operated and partnered, being 50% of our business in the long term. We have made significant progress to date, increasing the digital mix of our business by more than 10 points in Q3 versus the prior year. NIKE\u2019s ability to sustainably grow digital for the long-term is rooted in our member connections and compelling experiences that only NIKE can offer. And our members are more engaged than ever, with an over 60% increase in monthly engaged users for the quarter, led by our SNKRS App, where we\u2019re seeing 4x the engagement in monthly active users versus last year. This heightened engagement is translating into buying. We\u2019re seeing continued member growth outpace total digital growth as buying members increased 80% versus the prior year. And these connections extend beyond digital. In our own stores, member demand penetration rates are seeing meaningful increases, enabled by robust store training programs, member-specific promotions and enhanced account linking capabilities. This is critical as we strategically focus on better serving and driving repeat engagement with active, high-value members across all of our channels. In the end, NIKE is staying on offense and we are focused on extending our leadership position. We have a proven playbook, led by digital, and everything we\u2019ve seen makes us more confident in our future. Our focus is on the long-term and we are not slowing down. And with that, I will turn the call over to Matt. Matt Friend : Thank you, John and hello to everyone on the call. As we have entered into a new calendar year filled with new opportunities amidst pandemic-related challenges, our focus has not wavered. We continue to position NIKE to win today and over the long term. We are now 1 year into managing through these dynamics and we have met every hurdle with leadership and decisive action. While we are optimistic about the pace of vaccine distribution and how this will enable safe reopening of the global economy in the near future, the effects of the virus continue to create short-term volatility in our business performance. For example, in Q3, disruption in the global supply chain due to container shortages, transportation delays and port congestion has interrupted the flow of inventory supply. The result has been supply shortages relative to continued strong marketplace demand. In North America specifically, inventory supply was delayed by more than 3 weeks, impacting the timing of wholesale shipments and growth in the quarter. In EMEA, additional COVID-related lockdowns caused a higher number of physical retail stores to be closed and/or operate on reduced hours versus the prior quarter. But our operating priorities remain unchanged and we\u2019re focused on what we can control : optimize marketplace supply and demand with speed and agility, accelerate the pace of direct connections with consumers and exert our financial strength to move faster towards our long-term strategic vision of the consumer direct acceleration. I am proud of how our teams continue to respond, demonstrating how to win in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment. And our results reflect our team\u2019s unwavering commitment to serving our consumers. John couldn\u2019t have said it any better, we adjust and we win. This is the mentality that will propel us forward as we focus on the future. Now as I reflect on the third quarter, I want to highlight two important points. First, NIKE\u2019s brand momentum is as strong as ever, and we are driving focused growth in our largest opportunities. Our innovation and product franchises are resonating with consumers. This translated into double-digit retail sales growth over the holiday season. We drove a higher proportion of full-price sales with lower markdown activity, and this retail momentum has continued into the spring season. At our core, NIKE is a growth company. And we delivered another strong quarter of performance against our largest long-term growth opportunities. Greater China set the pace for our geographies, growing revenue 42% on a currency-neutral basis. We set another record for Chinese New Year, with digital demand doubling versus fiscal \u201819. NIKE Digital grew 54%, led by strong growth across our mobile app ecosystem. Demand on the NIKE App grew 90% versus the prior year. Women\u2019s drove over-indexing revenue growth for the quarter, including nearly 90% growth in NIKE Digital. And with high double-digit retail sales growth across the marketplace, we are increasing NIKE\u2019s market share across our key markets. And last, the Jordan Brand grew 15%, delivering its third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth with incredible brand momentum and a clear formula of growth for the future. We are exceeding pre-pandemic levels of business, and our brand momentum is clear. From our relentless flow of new product and storytelling, to our deep consumer connections, our extensive portfolio of athletes and teams and the scale of our digital platforms, NIKE is positioned to drive high-quality, sustainable and profitable growth across our portfolio. Second, this quarter demonstrated how a more direct, digitally enabled NIKE will fuel long-term strategic and financial value. Our consumer direct acceleration strategy is driving a meaningful and broader marketplace shift and it is transforming our financial model. Our own digital business has grown more than 70% year-to-date, and our mix of owned and partner digital now exceeds 35% of our total business. This quarter, we increased member buying frequency and grew retained buying members versus the prior year and the prior quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal \u201822 and beyond, we expect digital to continue to be our fastest-growing marketplace channel, with digital mix increasing towards our 50% vision. NIKE physical stores are another key enabler to drive our consumer direct acceleration. And our monobrand store expansion strategy creates an incremental market opportunity for NIKE. New retail concepts such as Live, Rise and Unite will create distinctive, authentic and premium NIKE consumer experiences in the marketplace. They will accelerate NIKE member acquisition at scale, while unlocking higher retail productivity. They will recapture displaced consumer demand as we restructure the wholesale marketplace with our strategic partners. And most importantly, they will accelerate NIKE Digital growth by scaling online to offline capabilities as our physical presence reaches a greater number of consumers. A great example of this are the 2 new Nike Live concepts we opened in Greater China this quarter, where member checkout rates reached 90%, paving the way for connected member journeys and member-led digital growth. We look forward to scaling these new retail concepts into fiscal \u201822. As I\u2019ve said before, this strategic shift to increasingly direct and personalized connections with consumers unlock strategic and financial opportunity for NIKE. This quarter, NIKE Direct gross margins contributed to our overall gross margin expansion of 130 basis points, being fueled by a higher mix of digital, which carries a higher gross margin rate as well as optimization of new pricing capabilities using advanced analytics in North America. We are also continuing to test and learn within our full funnel digital marketing activities and our pace of learning is accelerating with so much opportunity ahead. During Q3 in North America, we leveraged data to identify consumer cohorts and feature personalized product recommendations to members to both activate members who have never purchased and increase repeat purchasing. We expect Datalogue to amplify our speed in analyzing consumer data and inform product, marketing and service recommendations, ultimately increasing member buying frequency, basket size and member retention rates. It is clear that our shift to a more direct, member-centric business is beginning to drive strategic and financial value for NIKE and we are confident we are making the right investments in the areas that matter most. Now let\u2019s turn to the details of our third quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 3% in Q3, declining 1% on a currency-neutral basis, as NIKE Direct grew 16%, led by strong NIKE Digital growth, offset by declines in our wholesale business due to the timing of wholesale shipments caused by global supply chain challenges in North America and mandatory store closures in EMEA. Gross margin increased 130 basis points versus the prior year, resulting from higher full price product margins, due in part to geography mix and favorable NIKE Digital mix, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct rate as we continue to manage inventory levels due to COVID-19 as well as foreign exchange headwinds. SG&A declined 7% in the quarter, as we shifted certain demand creation initiatives to better align our investments with product delivery time lines and market conditions, along with lower operating overhead due primarily to lower wage related costs versus the prior year and continued expense management. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.4% compared to 3.9% for the same period last year due to decreased benefits from discrete items and a shift in earnings mix, in part due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.90, up 70% versus the prior year. As a reminder, prior year EPS included a $0.25 non-cash FX-related charge associated with the planned transition to a strategic distributor model in South America. With that, let\u2019s turn to our operating segments. In North America, Q3 revenue declined 11% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT increased 4% on a reported basis. We saw strong retail sales growth over the holiday season and drove clean marketplace inventory due to our first half supply and demand management actions. However, starting in late December, container shortages and West Coast port congestion began to increase the transit times of inventory supply by more than 3 weeks. The result was a lack of available supply, delayed shipments to wholesale partners and lower-than-expected quarterly revenue growth. We expect to capture this delayed revenue in the fourth quarter. NIKE Direct, however, grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis, led by NIKE Digital growth of more than 50% and we have seen this momentum continue into March. This quarter, we accelerated analytics capabilities to dynamically adjust pricing and fulfillment alternatives as we balance consumer demand, inventory availability and profitability. We also prioritized available product supply to NIKE Direct and our strategic partners. Inventory in North America grew 31% versus the prior year. We had extraordinarily high levels of in-transit inventory due to increased transit times. Inventory units in our distribution centers declined nearly 20%. With strong consumer demand continuing through the spring season and marketplace inventory down high double digits versus the prior year, we expect continued full price momentum, despite the short-term supply disruption and elevated levels of in-transit inventory related to ongoing global supply chain dynamics. In EMEA, Q3 revenue declined 9% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT declined 7% on a reported basis. Across most countries in Western Europe, government restrictions caused an acceleration of store closures, with approximately 45% of our NIKE-owned stores closed over the last 2 months of the quarter. We have leveraged our supply and demand playbook and specifically Express Lane to recalibrate marketplace inventory. Excess inventory in EMEA is manageable and lower than during the first wave of lockdowns. Assuming lockdown restrictions begin to ease by mid-April, we expect EMEA inventory to be normalized in the first quarter of fiscal \u201822. As of today, approximately 35% of our NIKE-owned stores are closed and this situation continues to be dynamic. But in markets where our stores have reopened, we are seeing strong consumer response and continued brand momentum, with higher conversion rates and strong comp sales growth year-over-year, complementing strong digital growth. With NIKE-owned and partner stores mostly closed, we leveraged the strength of our NIKE Digital business, which grew 60% on a currency-neutral basis, led by the NIKE App, which grew triple digits in the quarter, and NIKE Digital demand has continued to grow triple digits in March. With that, let\u2019s turn to Greater China, which achieved its second consecutive $2 billion quarter and grew 42% on a currency-neutral basis, with EBIT growth of 75% on a reported basis. NIKE Direct grew 52% versus the prior year, with more than 40% growth in digital and nearly 60% growth in NIKE-owned stores as the retail market largely returned to normal, including strong double-digit growth in partner retail stores, widening our market lead as the favorite brand with consumers. As I mentioned earlier, Chinese New Year was a key highlight and through our Express Lane offense, we created and delivered hyperlocal products to celebrate the moment, including the Dunk Low and the women\u2019s Dunk Disrupt, which both instantly sold out. Our women\u2019s business grew more than 60% versus the prior year and our 2 new Nike Live stores are resonating deeply with her since opening. In digital, we focused on engaging and serving members across multiple platforms, including live stream and social media. During Chinese New Year, we doubled our number of high-value members. We also \u2013 while also increasing member retention. We\u2019re excited by the opportunity we see ahead and so we are accelerating investment in Greater China, including in the local consumer digital experience, new retail concepts and omni-channel integration with our owned and partner stores. Finally, in our APLA geography, Q3 revenue declined 8% on a currency-neutral basis and was temporarily impacted by the transition of our business in Brazil to a strategic distributor model, partially offset by continued strength in South Korea and Pacific. And Q3 EBIT grew 5% versus the prior year on a reported basis. NIKE Digital grew nearly 70% on a currency-neutral basis and we focused on member engagement and the scaling of consumer services like member days. In Japan, we drove record weeks of member buying, launched our interactive live streaming on SNKRS and activated new O2O capabilities. In Mexico, we more than doubled our digital growth and we plan to launch the NIKE mobile app in the first half of fiscal \u201822. I will now turn to our financial outlook. This past year has been one of the most dynamic operating environments in our history, and Q3 was no exception. Despite these continued challenges, we remain focused on serving the consumer while making clear operating decisions with speed and agility. We can see the near-term operating environment with increasing clarity yet we remain focused on what\u2019s required to win for the long term. With that in mind, we are now more confident in our full year outlook for revenue and expect low to mid-teens growth versus the prior year. Specifically for Q4, in our least comparable quarter of the fiscal year, we expect revenue growth of roughly 75% versus the prior year. This reflects government-mandated restrictions in Europe starting to ease in April and inventory transit times slowly improving in North America. We now expect gross margin to expand up to 75 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting the continued shifts we\u2019ve seen to our more profitable NIKE Direct business, partially offset by higher logistics and freight costs and higher markdowns to liquidate excess inventory in EMEA. Foreign exchange is now estimated to be a roughly 35 basis point headwind on the full year. We expect SG&A dollars will be slightly up versus the prior year as we rebuild investment levels and demand creation towards pre-pandemic levels and continue to invest to accelerate the pace of our digital transformation. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the low to mid-teens for the full year. And finally, we will resume moderate levels of share repurchase beginning in the fourth quarter. We are confident in our outlook for strong free cash flow growth, which enables us to accelerate capital returns while making the necessary investments to enable our consumer direct acceleration. Looking ahead to fiscal \u201822, as I said earlier, we are already exceeding our pre-pandemic levels of business. And I expect the momentum we are seeing to translate into continued strong revenue growth. I will provide more specific guidance for fiscal \u201822 on our next earnings call. As a growth company, our offense is working. NIKE\u2019s brand momentum is as strong as ever. Our product is resonating, the pipeline is strong and our brands are more deeply connected to consumers than ever before. The pace of our digital transformation is also accelerating and we are investing against the large market opportunity we see. We are converting more consumers into members and connecting more deeply, more frequently and more meaningfully via our digital platforms and ultimately also through our One Nike Marketplace strategic partners. My optimism for NIKE\u2019s long-term potential has never been higher. And so with that, let\u2019s open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Bob Drbul : Hi, guys. Good afternoon. John Donahoe : Good afternoon, Bob. Bob Drbul : I guess, I was wondering on the inventory, I think the delayed flow of inventory you talked about your confidence in essentially just moving everything into the fourth quarter. Just \u2013 can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of \u2013 will that be largely into the wholesale where you sort of missed some of the sales? Are you going to move it to more the apps or the online, the SNKRS App and Nike.com app? Just could you give us a little more color around the plans to move that inventory in the fourth quarter? Thanks. John Donahoe : Sure. Well, as I mentioned, we saw an extension of transit times of inventory by up to 3 weeks. And what that means is that across the marketplace, we were anticipating to have more available supply in the third quarter than ultimately what we were able to have to satisfy demand across both the direct side of the business and across our wholesale partners. We\u2019ve now effectively absorbed the longer lead times through our third quarter. And so, we do expect a more consistent flow of inventory in the fourth quarter, recognizing that transit times are elevated versus the prior year, but we expect a more consistent flow of inventory from here. I mentioned, Bob, in my prepared remarks that we continue to see strong demand across the marketplace, and we\u2019re seeing stronger demand. We continue to see stronger demand in differentiated retail, which is our strategic partners, than we\u2019re seeing in undifferentiated retail. And so, we will continue to prioritize inventory for our strategic partners and for NIKE Direct. And when we look at where marketplace inventory is today, it\u2019s down high-double digits versus where it was a year ago. And so, there is strong demand for that inventory across our strategic partners and NIKE Direct, and we continue to \u2013 we intend to continue to fulfill that demand in both of those locations. Bob Drbul : Great, great. And if I could just ask a follow-up question, the \u2013 so, I recently had a chance to re-watch The Last [indiscernible], and I think the original budget for the Jordans in \u2013 was that $4 million or $3 million in year 4, they did $126 million in year 1. I was wondering if you could tell us who was responsible for the budget that year and maybe if you could just give us a little bit more flavor on how different your forecasting is these days? I think that might be quite interesting. Matt Friend : Well, Bob, I\u2019ve been at NIKE for a little over 12 years, and so I might suggest that you go back and re-read [indiscernible]. You might be able to figure out who was back there at that point in time who was making those decisions. Bob Drbul : Alright. I\u2019ll do that. Matt Friend : And I sure our forecasting is better than that. John Donahoe : He dreamed big and we delivered. Bob Drbul : Thank you. John Donahoe : Thanks Bob. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Binetti : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our questions, and Matt I wanted to ask you, I think you just said that you raised the revenue growth rate for the year. Obviously, that helps to add a lot of confidence to your ability to unlock some of that inventory. But I think you previously described that the SG&A for the year at up-low singles, and now you\u2019re saying up slightly, while you\u2019re raising revenue growth. But you did say there was some reinvestment in demand creation there, too. So I\u2019m trying to put the \u2013 just at a high level, the picture together. It seems like there is either much more efficient demand creation going on that we can think about as the model kind of builds back post COVID longer term, or better leverage on the operating overhead expense line. Maybe you could just help us think about why the SG&A is able to stay at a fairly manageable level there while you keep raising the revenue line? Matt Friend : Sure. Well, I should start by saying that as we get into the fourth quarter, the comparisons start to get pretty challenging as you look year-over-year. The comparisons aren\u2019t going to be linear as compared to where we\u2019ve been in prior quarters, nor will they be intuitive. But when I talk about investment levels, I need to start with the core principle, which is NIKE is a growth company. And so as we continue to see the market opportunity in front of us, we are poised and in this position of strength to be able to accelerate investment against the things that are most critical in order to enable and drive our consumer direct acceleration strategy. Now in the middle of COVID, we got extremely focused on what matters most and we reallocated resources and tightly \u2013 and from a disciplined perspective, managed our expenses so that we could continue investing against the things that matter most to our strategy, like our tech \u2013 end-to-end tech transformation, digitizing our supply chain, and ultimately investing in the marketplace. And so, we\u2019ve continued to do that while we\u2019ve been able to manage other expenses more tightly as a result of the environment we\u2019re in. As we start to look at coming out of the pandemic, we don\u2019t intend to just add it back in, okay? Every dollar we\u2019re putting back in we know is going to create or we have a plan to create a return on it. And so, we\u2019re taking advantage of the moment to be able to do that, and we will continue to accelerate investment against those levels. But to your point, historically prior to COVID, we were at about 33% of revenue in terms of our SG&A levels, and we\u2019ve been able to manage through the last \u2013 the first three quarters of this year closer to 29%, and demand creation has been a source of leverage over this period. The reduction in sport activity in the first half of this year as well as some work that we did to sharpen certain areas of historical marketing investment, and as a result of that, demand creation investment was driving some leverage for us. Prior to COVID, we were at something like 9% or 10% of revenue, and it fell to about 7% in the first half. But what I mentioned on the last earnings call is that we don\u2019t think these are sustainable levels for demand creation as we look forward. And so, given the speed of our recovery in the first half, our plan was to start accelerating investment back towards pre-pandemic levels. We won\u2019t get there in one quarter. We will get there over a period of time, but we believe that that\u2019s the right thing to do from a position of strength and given the size and scale of our brand and our recovery. So we had planned to spend more in the third quarter. But when we started to see the supply chain shifts occurring, we decided to shift some of that marketing investment into the fourth quarter in order to be able to balance and have those marketing investments occur at the time that the product was available in the marketplace. We\u2019re going to be accelerating investment in Q4 against our biggest growth opportunities. Women\u2019s, we\u2019re going to continue to be investing internationally, as I mentioned, against \u2013 we\u2019re going to be investing behind Jordan. And we are going to continue to invest against digital. But we do believe longer term, Michael, that digital will be a source of leverage for us as we drive a greater return on ad spend and see more effectiveness in our full funnel marketing. And so that will be a source of leverage over time. Michael Binetti : Okay. Thanks for that. And then John, if I could ask one follow-up, you speak about the physical store strategy globally. It sounds like there is a lot of new interesting concepts. And I guess in North America, a market that grew up long ago is more of a wholesale model, and you\u2019ve made the biggest effort to transform the marketplace there. If the \u2013 I\u2019m curious how you see the segmentation effort as a lot of undifferentiated retailers come out of your business, but you still do have strategic partners through \u2013 with stores through the U.S. In the past, we\u2019ve seen you segment by House of Hoops, Track Club, the big installations at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, those kinds of things. How do you think about the next round of segmenting the market when, if you\u2019re going to be bringing more NIKE brand stores into the market now in a backdrop that has some of those wholesale partners still out there that are generating good business? John Donahoe : Well, Michael, we start with the consumer, we start in every case with the consumer, and the consumer is really clear that they want to get what they want, when they want it, how they want it. And they want a seamless, premium digital and physical experience. In fact, in many cases, they don\u2019t see a difference between digital and physical, whether they bought it on digitally and had it delivered at home or whether they bought it digitally and picked it up in store, whether it was one of our stores or one of our strategic partner stores. And so we do see a need and a really important role for strategic physical presence, both ours and our partners. And the way we\u2019ll go forward is we are driving, starting with our own digital and our own stores, the seamless premium experience that\u2019s centered on the member, where we know who the member is. That member expects us to know who they are, whether they are in our stores or our partner stores. And so we\u2019ll work with a smaller number of strategic partners that see the same future we do and that want to and are willing to share membership data so that we can together deliver a very seamless experience, a very personalized experience for consumers. And the whole One Nike Marketplace will allow us to help consumers to get what they want, when they want it, how they want it. And so as we segment, it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re leaning in with those partners that see the world the same way we do. And those are the ones and the good news is they do. And the good news is those are the partners that have the most robust business with our shared consumers today. So the consolidation will continue. And again, I think you\u2019ll see even more movement from undifferentiated retail into a smaller number of \u2013 a smaller number of partners and our own stores that provide that seamless premium experience. Michael Binetti : Thanks a lot, John. Operator : Our next question is from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Erinn Murphy : Great, thanks. Good afternoon. John, for you, I was hoping you could speak a little bit more about the strength you\u2019ve seen in China, maybe a little bit on the consumer behavior as well as the product trends as that economy has picked up. Is there anything that you\u2019re looking or that you can learn from what you\u2019re seeing there for the rest of the world as we all open up? And then Matt, just for you, a clarification, would you be able to quantify kind of what you think the port miss was on North American segment in the quarter? Thank you. John Donahoe : Well, Erinn, on China, it\u2019s just really clear, and it\u2019s sort of interesting. I\u2019m on my, I guess, 14 month, but I so distinctly remember and fondly recall, my first week at NIKE was in China, as you recall, on the streets of Shanghai and Beijing, seeing the incredible connection that the Chinese consumer has with the NIKE, Jordan and Converse brands and frankly, seeing really high-quality physical retail to my prior \u2013 to the prior question, prior answer. The merchandising \u2013 these are all mono-brand stores, as you know, with us, our direct ones and our partners. And when you see what a outstanding physical merchandise experience can be and link that to a seamless digital experience, it\u2019s quite powerful. And we\u2019re probably furthest along in the world on that in China. And I will say that our Chinese team has just done a fabulous job in the past year of not just building a great business, but showing the way for other parts of the company. They obviously have done that through the pandemic being constantly 3 to 6 months ahead. Including today, being back at work side-by-side and the energy that comes with that, including today having physical retail open and seeing traffic getting close to historical levels. But they are also leading on that seamless experience. An example I\u2019ll highlight is just the one, I think Matt mentioned this in his remarks, on our new doors there, they are getting 70%, 80%, 90% of consumers in physical doors to either identify themselves as members or sign up and become members. And that allows that seamless experience for a consumer. So they are not \u2013 they are completely indifferent about whether they buy it, have it shipped to home, buy it online and pick it up in the store, whether within the store and they buy it and have it shipped home. And so I think that strong connection we have with consumers, brand-wise, but also that when we talk about the consistent premium, seamless experience, online to offline, that deliver consumers, we\u2019re furthest along. We\u2019re furthest along in China, and I give that team huge credit, and we\u2019re rapidly following that in our other geographies and regions. Matt Friend : I\u2019d maybe just jump in and say on the China piece that we continue to scale the Express Lane in China. And I referenced a couple of examples in the quarter related to Chinese New Year specific product. But we doubled the Express Lane in the quarter, and it continues to have significant impact, not only on localizing product but also \u2013 localizing product, but also speed and agility in the marketplace through our fulfillment models. And then Erinn, maybe one other indication vis-\u00e0-vis China being ahead of other places, as the world has opened up, sport is returning. And so just the energy that we\u2019re seeing with sport returning, we\u2019re seeing our Performance business continue to grow significantly as well as our Kids business in that market, and it gives us a lot of optimism as we\u2019re looking ahead to reopening occurring in North America, Europe and other places. Specifically on your question about North America, what I would just say is we were on track to deliver our internal plans, and we were seeing momentum that was consistent with the type of momentum that we\u2019ve been seeing year-to-date as we are shifting, creating the marketplace shifts and continuing to lead with NIKE Direct and our strategic partners. Operator : Our next question is from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Omar Saad : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Hey, John, I wanted to follow-up on an interesting comment you made about merging art and science. And when you were talking about putting the data people alongside the creative people, maybe you could dive into that a little bit more. What your vision is and what areas are you applying data? Is it just customer analytics or is it in design and marketing and other areas? We\u2019d be really curious to see how you\u2019re doing that. And then my follow-up question is around women\u2019s. It kind of seems like a recurring theme. You guys are doing really well in a lot of areas in the women\u2019s business. What are the key drivers? What\u2019s the difference from the past? NIKE has been focused on women\u2019s a long time, but it seems to be inflecting. And maybe if you could update us on where women\u2019s is in the mix and how big that maybe that could be over time? Thanks. John Donahoe : Great, Omar. And Matt, why don\u2019t I take a cut of these and you can fill in. On \u2013 Omar, on data, data will ultimately improve our ability to deliver great experiences throughout our value chain. Now the most obvious place is at the consumer-facing front, right? So even in this quarter, we saw use of data to deliver more targeted communications to consumers and more personalized experience. And I would say, relative to what\u2019s possible, we\u2019re just scratching the surface there. So on that sort of consumer-facing side, data played a really \u2013 has played an important role and will continue to play an important role. The second area it plays an important role is one part of the consumer experience was getting the right product in the right place at the right time. And so this is where our select acquisition has allowed us to fairly impressively pivot to a more direct-to-consumer supply chain. And I, again, give our supply chain team enormous credit for what they have done over the last year as we have pivoted toward digital. But what that\u2019s all about is knowing what inventory to have resident in local regional warehouses so that you can get delivered more rapidly and often through ground transportation. By the way, both of those are scale games. The more data you have, if you\u2019re the leader and you have more scale, it allows you to deliver better experiences and have better efficiency. And as you described, data will ultimately also be able to help us do better design and create better products. Some of the people that are most excited in the company about what data and technology can do are John Hoke, our \u2013 who runs design, and Phil McCartney and Aaron Heiser, who run footwear and apparel. They are like with the data that we now have from our digital sites and that we can get from our consumer insights group, it just means that we can design footwear and apparel that\u2019s even more focused and more targeted on what the consumer wants. And so I\u2019d say we\u2019re into our data journey, but there is so much more opportunity to come. And I think the entire company sees it and is excited about it. With respect to women\u2019s, the women\u2019s business is having a great momentum. It was the \u2013 I think eighth straight quarter where women\u2019s growth out indexed overall growth. And that\u2019s across both NIKE and Jordan Brand. And that had 86% growth in NIKE Digital. And physical retail, marketplace retail, grew to high double digits, and we\u2019re gaining share in women\u2019s, both on footwear and apparel. And while we\u2019re seeing success in women\u2019s to date, this move toward the consumer construct that we\u2019ve described with a real dedicated and focused women\u2019s team, means that we can increase our investment. So we\u2019ve doubled our investment in women\u2019s innovation over the past year, and that extends end-to-end. And so a wonderful example of what that can produce is what I referred to earlier, this React Escape. Because we launched it this quarter, this running shoe takes into account the physiological differences between male and female bodies. And so its silhouette, its materials, its design details are all aimed at the new female runner. And we think it\u2019s just a wonderful example of how we can take sharper insights and a greater focus end-to-end across our organization to really continue to turbocharge our women\u2019s business. Matt Friend : I would just add that some of the comments John made earlier as well just about our store strategy, the Nike Live concept is a is a concept that\u2019s intended to unlock significant growth in the women\u2019s marketplace. And we just \u2013 it would be hard, Omar, to size the opportunity because the women\u2019s market is so large. And we see the opportunity relative to where our business is penetrated today. And so while we continue to take share, those definitions are within the refinement of the way people define the market from an athletic footwear and athletic apparel in this. But what we\u2019re also seeing is athletic taking share of the broader women\u2019s marketplace. And so those are going to be fuel for growth for us as we continue to invest behind this exciting opportunity. Andy Muir : Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator : Our last question comes from Jamie Merriman with Bernstein. Your line is open. Jamie Merriman : Thanks so much. John, I think we\u2019ve talked on several calls about the investment in data and even on this one. And so I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the Datalogue acquisition? And then I think, Matt, on prior calls has talked about the margin advantage of digital. But it seems to me that there is some real P&L benefits from the scaling of data. So if you kind of had to dream the dream, what do you think the opportunity is there? Thank you. John Donahoe : Well, Matt, maybe I\u2019ll dream the dream around the consumer, and you can dream the dream around our income statement. I think they are very linked. Jamie, it\u2019s \u2013 I had to say we\u2019re just scratching the surface. I mean, so yes, Datalogue is our fourth data and analytics acquisition over the past couple of years. And they use machine learning to help automate, translating raw data into critical and actionable insights and doing it real-time at enterprise scale. And so as I said earlier, you\u2019re beginning to see whether it\u2019s improved and personalized search results, whether you\u2019re seeing more personalized recommendations of what if you bought this, you should buy this, if it\u2019s anticipating timing of when you\u2019re due for potentially some new footwear or some new apparel. Data just allows us to have a more personalized experience with consumers, and it\u2019s what consumers want and expect from a brand like NIKE, There are an awful lot of brands out there or platforms where they don\u2019t want people, they don\u2019t want people to know them well. NIKE is a brand and Jordan, where consumers want us to know them well and offer that even better experience. And then as you said and as I said a minute ago, almost across every step of our value chain, data enables us to, one, deliver the right product, right place, right time to that consumer. As I described earlier, and two, it drives efficiency and productivity. But our focus will be on the consumer. And that\u2019s one of the things that I think has always been a hallmark of NIKE is the consumer is absolutely at the center. And so we\u2019re going to prioritize that and continue to invest heavily in technology enablement and data. And as you said, scale matters. Scale matters because you get the most actionable data. This is \u2013 it\u2019s true in the technology industry. It\u2019s also true, I think, in our industry, and so we\u2019ll have a scale advantage in data. And it will drive both better consumer experience and efficiency. Matt, do you want to comment, add to that? Matt Friend : Yes. So I\u2019ll dream the dream on the financial side of it. We think that, as I\u2019ve said for several quarters in a row, and Andy said before me, that the financial value of data and technology are significant for us. And we\u2019re already starting to see some of it, Jamie, in our current performance, but the opportunity in front of us is significant. It\u2019s being right more of the time. And where you\u2019ll see it drive financial value through our P&L is making better pricing and merchandising decisions, where we place our inventory, how we choose to fulfill demand. All of those things will result in, and we see how a much more scientific and data-driven and machine learning approach to this is taking \u2013 is using human judgment with great analytics to enable us to make those decisions. And then I think more broadly as an enterprise, as we continue to automate the way we work and leverage technology end-to-end, there is going to be productivity in the manual processes and work that we do as a company today. And so I think you\u2019ll also see productivity in SG&A over time as a result of us being able to leverage this type of capacity versus working in a more legacy type of fashion. And so we\u2019re investing heavily towards all of those opportunities. John Donahoe : And Matt, I\u2019m going to just maybe add one final comment before we wrap up because I do want to \u2013 we\u2019ve had two, three data questions in a row, but as you said, Jamie, art and science. The science, the science of what we are doing, it\u2019s been done, it\u2019s doable. But the thing that makes this company remarkable is the art. It\u2019s the creativity of our apparel designers, of our footwear designers. It\u2019s the creativity of our brand teams and the storytelling they do and so data doesn\u2019t displace art. It\u2019s both. It\u2019s data and technology help enhance it and supplement it. But this \u2013 the core of this, the heart and soul of this company is an amazing wellspring of creativity and innovation and the mindset in everything we do. And so I just \u2013 this is going to make it a little bit more direct-to-consumer and make it a little bit more efficient. But we will never lose sight of the art of what NIKE, Jordan and Converse do. So, with that, Andy time to wrap up. Andy Muir : Yes. Thank you, Jamie, and thank you, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. So take care. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc.\u2019s President and CEO, John Donahoe. John Donahoe : Thanks Andy, and hello to everyone on today\u2019s call. Looking at Q4 and the full fiscal year we just concluded, our strong business results proved yet again NIKE\u2019s unique competitive advantage. Our relentless focus on our objectives is clear and our strategy is working. We are excited by the momentum we continue to see. In Q4, we saw growth of over 95%, which translates to 19% growth for the fiscal year. This full-year growth was led by our own digital business, which has now more than doubled versus fiscal \u201819 prior to the pandemic. I\u2019ve said before that these are times when strong brands can get stronger. And each quarter, this reality becomes even more clear. Today, we are better positioned to drive sustainable long-term growth than we were before the pandemic. Our team has proven their ability to be unrelenting and executing against the macro complexities while also building the future. We saw broad-based growth this quarter led by North America at over 140%. Greater China\u2019s currency-neutral growth of 9% was impacted amidst marketplace dynamics with improving trends as we exited the quarter. One of NIKE\u2019s strengths is our diverse global portfolio. And through the power of that portfolio, we once again over delivered on our expectations for the quarter. As we look ahead to fiscal \u201822, the opportunity ahead of us is significant. We remain very confident in our long-term strategy and our growth outlook. The structural tailwinds we\u2019ve discussed before, including the return to sport and permanent shifts in consumer behavior toward digital and health and wellness continue to create energy for us. And we remain focused on our largest growth drivers, including our women\u2019s business, apparel, Jordan, and international. NIKE sets the pace through a continuous flow of new innovation, the world\u2019s greatest roster of athletes and compelling experiences for consumers that create lifelong relationships with our brand. Our strengths and proven playbook give us the confidence to move even faster to invest at even a more accelerated pace against the opportunities we see ahead. As the world\u2019s largest athletic footwear and apparel brand, we take seriously our leadership position to promote sport participation and an active lifestyle through inspiration and innovation. Our goal isn\u2019t merely to take market share. Our goal is also to grow the entire market. NIKE\u2019s growth has been and will continue to be the result of three areas I will walk through today : connecting with consumers through compelling brand experiences across Nike, Jordan, and Converse; driving product innovation against our greatest growth opportunities; and expanding our digital advantage. First, let\u2019s discuss how we serve consumers. As sport continues to return, NIKE leads with our unique, rich heritage and our deep roster of global superstars and up-and-comers who connect us with consumers everywhere. Euro 2020 started two weeks ago with Cristiano Ronaldo becoming the leading scorer in Euro\u2019s history. England, France, Portugal, and the Netherlands are among the teams with great momentum heading into the tournament\u2019s next stage, and we\u2019re proud that more goals have been scored thus far wearing NIKE boots than all other brands combined. On the club side, Chelsea won the Champions League on the men\u2019s side and Barcelona was the top team on the women\u2019s side. In the U.S., the WNBA season is underway with the Seattle Storm in first place led by Sue Bird and Jewell Loyd. And in the NBA, a captivating playoffs has showcased our unmatched rosters of the game\u2019s greatest players across NIKE and Jordan, including KD, LeBron, Luka, Jokic, and several who are still in the hunt like Giannis, Chris Paul, Devin Booker, and Paul George. And earlier this week, I was in Eugene for the U.S. track and field trials and got to see incredible performances from Sha\u2019Carri Richardson, Michael Norman, Ryan Crouser, and many others. We remain excited for the power of sport on full display during the Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo this summer and in Beijing next year. This authentic connection with consumers is also fueled by our belief in redefining how we open access to sports for consumers everywhere. Our recent campaign, Play New, launched in May, kicking off our largest ever invitation to Gen Z and marking the ignition point of a month-long rally around finding joy and movement in play. We focus Play New on TikTok and Snapchat to show Gen Z that, in their words, sport is a change accelerator. And their response has been remarkable. The app\u2019s augmented reality lenses featuring yoga, dance, and surf led to more than 600 million Gen Z impressions in just the first two weeks. Earlier, I mentioned our goal to grow the market. Well, by inspiring people to try something for the first time, we vastly expand the community of athletes. And we continue to bring the emotion and power of our brand to life through our digital ecosystem, which is led by the SNKRS App. In Q4, SNKRS grew over 90% in demand and saw nearly 80% growth in monthly active users. We\u2019re now offering this growing audience of high-value members in almost daily flow of compelling content and product launches. For Air Max Day in March, six different livestream events gave SNKRS Live its highest viewership ever. So, whether it\u2019s through SNKRS Live or user-generated style inspiration, SNKRS is the perfect intersection of content, community, and commerce. Moving to my second point, our relentless pipeline of innovative product continues to create separation between us and our competition. Our product is fueled by sharp consumer insight supported by marketing data and analytics as we continue to invest in our digital transformation. And through our new operating model, we are bringing more precision to the art of product creation as we blend the heart and science of innovation. For Q4, let me touch on two great examples of how we are investing in our top growth opportunities, our women\u2019s business and Jordan Brand. We are investing and focused across the entire value chain to unlock the vast opportunity we see for women\u2019s. For the full year, our women\u2019s business drove outsized growth of 22% versus the prior year. And despite the tremendous momentum we\u2019re seeing in women\u2019s, we know that there\u2019s even greater growth ahead as we move even faster with our new organization structure and invest far more resources in serving women end to end. For instance, in the marketplace, we continue to provide more compelling retail environment through our NIKE Live format. In fact, this past year, we opened nine new NIKE Live doors, which offer personalized experiences and services for female consumers. Our investments also mean a larger, sharper focus on women\u2019s-only insights, services, and product innovation, and we\u2019re already seeing this work come to life. Consumer insight from our female consumer drove the new Pegasus 38, which kept the best cushioning innovations from this popular franchise while improving and tailoring comfort and fit that she wants. The Peg 38 has sold extremely well, and we continue to be energized by the potential we see in footwear for her. For the WNBA\u2019s 25th season this year, we created the most comprehensive player, team and fan apparel collection in league history. The new WNBA uniforms were completely reengineered to deliver the exact fit, movement and comfort players said that they want from their jersey and sport. The players love them and consumers have agreed with sales growth well above our expectations and that heightened demand extended to the larger product assortment, with the WNBA\u2019s 25th anniversary tee selling out in 1 day. This is just one example of how we drive energy for women\u2019s sport across the marketplace as we remain excited by this enormous opportunity looking forward. Next, let\u2019s discuss Jordan Brand, whose momentum continues to be driven by its unique blend of heritage and innovation as well as its deep connections to consumers and communities around the globe. In fiscal \u201821, Jordan Brand grew 31%, propelling the business to nearly $5 billion. This growth was driven by continued energy for Jordan\u2019s most coveted icons, including the AJ1 and AJ11 as well as new product dimensions. For example, Jordan\u2019s women\u2019s business nearly tripled in Q4, fueled by compelling product, such as the Flight Essentials apparel collection. We are also increasingly are excited about our delivery of exclusive access for women through collabs like Aleali May\u2019s AJ1, which drove over 40% female buyers, more than 10 points higher than average AJ1 buyer profile. In Q4, Jordan also launched Zion Williamson\u2019s first signature shoe, the Zion 1, as well as the apparel collection. As the first Gen Z signature shoe in Jordan Brand\u2019s history, Zion offers both transcendent athletic possibility as well as a deep personal connection with fans. The strong sell-through of Zion\u2019s signature shoe collection demonstrates the continued love for Jordan Brands\u2019 roster of athletes all over the world. Quickly looking to the summer in Tokyo, in the next few weeks, we will be officially launching more of our Olympic product, including our USA women\u2019s basketball and football uniforms, our 4 Skateboarding Federation Kits and a new Medal Stand shoe featuring our hands-free FlyEase technology. We are excited by the strong reaction we\u2019ve seen for our Olympic product thus far. And we are also thrilled to see our innovation continue to separate us. In running, this includes our Vaporfly Next% 2 for distance runners as well as our best-in-class track spikes. As you have probably heard, our spikes are creating dominant performances at the U.S. track and field trials not just for NIKE athletes but competitor athletes as well. From performance to the Medal Stand to sustainability, we\u2019re excited for the world stage this summer in Tokyo to put a global spotlight on our advantage and innovation. One final observation on innovation, I recently got the chance to see the long-term product plans that our teams are developing against our new consumer construct of women\u2019s, men\u2019s, kids and Jordan with sharpness against sport performance and sport lifestyle, and I could not be more excited. It\u2019s safe to say that we\u2019re more confident than ever in our product pipeline as our focus on the consumer of the future drives our relentless innovation engine. And as we start welcoming employees back to work in our new state-of-the-art design and innovation centers, I know that our innovation pace will only quicken as we reinvent what\u2019s possible. My third and final point is increasing our digital advantage. As I said earlier, our owned digital business has more than doubled over the past 2 years to over $9 billion. And at the center of our digital ecosystem is our suite of apps, which in Q4 reflected over 40% of our owned digital business. This is the result of deeper consumer connections fueled by compelling product and content. A key differentiator for us is membership. It has proven to be a compelling driver of repeat engagement and buying across digital and physical retail. In Q4, we continued to see growth in member demand outpace total digital growth, hitting a new record of $3 billion. This member demand growth was underscored by strong results across the consumer funnel, including member engagement, average order value and buying frequency. In this fiscal year, we met the goals we set at our last Investor Day around membership a full year early and now have more than 300 million NIKE members. More importantly, buying member growth is outpacing new member growth, signaling progress on a deeper member-led commerce funnel. We are always looking to elevate our unique member proposition whether that means expanding the number of member-exclusive products or creating new and meaningful retail experiences through Member Days, our NIKE-only retail moments. And this engaging membership experience fuels a virtuous cycle, feeding insight to product creation, inventory optimization and more. Knowing and serving our members drives greater competitive separation. Today, we are the clear leaders in our industry, and we continue to see digital as our leading channel for growth in fiscal \u201822. The combination of owned and partner digital revenue is now nearly 35% of our total business, more than 3 years ahead of our prior plan. And we see no sign of this shift slowing. In fact, we believe we will achieve 50% digital mix of business across owned and partnered in fiscal \u201825. As part of our overall One Nike Marketplace, we are also actively engaged with our strategic wholesale partners who share our vision. Today, we\u2019re working closely with large strategic partners like DICK\u2019s Sporting Goods, Foot Locker and JD Sports as well as compelling local neighborhood partners who are authentic to sport performance and lifestyle. Together, we are driving change to create a new, more connected and seamless experience for consumers around the world, which is exactly what consumers want. It\u2019s a shift that speaks to our belief that the strong gets stronger. We\u2019re supercharging how we serve consumers with convenience, innovation, content and services. This is how we stay ahead of the pack and expand our lead. Finally, as we end our fiscal year, I want to thank our global NIKE teammates. We\u2019ve all been through a lot this past year. And at NIKE, that\u2019s included store closures, supply chain challenges, a digital transformation, a new accelerated strategy and more. And throughout it all, our team has delivered for our consumers and communities. So I just want to take a moment as I close to recognize and personally thank our 75,000 NIKE teammates. You\u2019ve demonstrated creativity, teamwork and resilience, and you are the reason NIKE leads. I\u2019ve said it before, and I\u2019ll say it again, the people of NIKE are our greatest competitive advantage. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Matt. Matt Friend : Thank you, John, and hello to everyone on the call today. Before I begin my prepared remarks, I too want to take a moment to thank our incredible team. They have delivered extraordinary results over the past year. I also want to take a moment and recognize Andy Muir. This will be her last earnings call as Vice President of Investor Relations after recently becoming CFO of our Jordan Brand. Thank you, Andy, for your leadership and specifically for your support in my transition to CFO last year. I wish you the best of luck in your new role. I know you\u2019ll do great. And backfilling Andy in this role is Paul Trussell, who many of you already know. Paul joins us from Deutsche Bank, and we\u2019re excited to welcome him to the NIKE team. Now I\u2019d like to begin today\u2019s call with a baseline on where we are in our recovery. Just as we anticipated, NIKE is emerging from the pandemic stronger and better positioned to serve the consumer. And the reason for this is clear, NIKE\u2019s Consumer Direct Acceleration is fueling a deeper consumer connection with our brands and driving business results, all while highlighting greater strategic and financial opportunity ahead. Over the past 15 months, we have navigated through this challenging environment with outstanding execution of our operational playbook. We have faced every challenge head-on, focused on what we could control, all while keeping the consumer at the center. These actions have helped set a strong foundation for sustainable growth and profitability, with business performance now exceeding pre-pandemic levels. In the fourth quarter, we delivered over $12 billion of reported revenue, our largest quarter ever. Our NIKE Direct business is now approaching 40% of total NIKE Brand revenue. NIKE Digital represents 21% of total NIKE Brand revenue, a milestone we\u2019ve reached several years ahead of our prior plan. And finally, our fiscal \u201821 EBIT margin reached 15.5%, reflecting more than 300 basis points of expansion when compared to fiscal \u201819. These metrics now become the new baseline from which we expect to grow. As we recover from the global pandemic, it is clear that our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy is transforming NIKE\u2019s financial model. So later on the call, I will share our financial outlook through fiscal year \u201825, reflecting a more direct, member-centric business model. However, first, I would like to provide additional detail on our extraordinary fourth quarter results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc.\u2019s revenue increased 96% and 88% on a currency-neutral basis. This was driven by strong wholesale shipments and NIKE owned store performance as we anniversary pandemic-related store closures. Even as physical retail reopened, we continued to see strong growth in NIKE Digital of 37% versus the prior year. Gross margin increased 850 basis points versus the prior year driven by favorable NIKE Direct margins and the anniversary of higher costs, including actions taken to manage supply and demand in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. SG&A grew 17% versus the prior year due to higher levels of brand activity connected to return of sport, digital marketing to drive digital demand, technology investments to support our digital transformation and higher wage-related expenses. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.6% compared to 1.7% for the same period last year due to decreased benefits from discrete items in the prior year and a shift in earnings mix, primarily related to pandemic recovery. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.93 and full year diluted earnings per share was $3.56, up 123% versus the prior year. Now let\u2019s move to our operating segments. In North America, Q4 revenue grew 141%. This also marked the first-ever $5 billion quarter for North America driven by notable improvement in full price sell-through as the marketplace reopened and sport activity returned. Demand for NIKE remained incredibly strong. And as we expected, delayed revenue from the global supply chain disruption in the third quarter was recaptured during the fourth quarter. NIKE Direct grew over 120% as NIKE owned stores returned to positive sales growth versus pre-pandemic levels. More importantly, NIKE Digital grew over 50%, while physical traffic continued to improve across the marketplace. NIKE Direct performance was propelled by our members across both digital and physical retail. Member demand nearly doubled versus the prior year, and the number of buying members grew roughly 80%. Across the total marketplace, we continue to see strong retail sales growth and consumer demand for our brands exceeding marketplace supply with marketplace inventory down double digits versus the prior year. NIKE owned inventory declined 7% with double-digit declines in closeout inventory. In-transit full price inventory remains elevated as we continue to experience longer end-to-end lead times for supply. We expect supply chain delays and higher logistics costs to persist throughout much of fiscal \u201822. In EMEA, Q4 revenue grew 107% on a currency-neutral basis with strong growth across the region, including the UK and Ireland, France, Germany and Italy. NIKE Direct grew 57% despite government restrictions requiring nearly half of our NIKE owned stores to remain closed for the first 2 months of the quarter. In May, as restrictions eased, we saw a strong consumer response with incredible pent-up demand, and this momentum has continued into June. NIKE Digital grew nearly 30% versus the prior year. Through our member days, we saw strong engagement with member demand outpacing total NIKE Direct revenue growth with all-time highs for female active members during Air Max week. In the fourth quarter, we also expanded the NIKE mobile app to more than 10 new countries across the region. During our last earnings call, I shared our expectation that inventory in EMEA would normalize in the first quarter of fiscal \u201822. We have exceeded that goal due to stronger-than-anticipated consumer demand, ending fiscal \u201821 in a healthy and normalized inventory position. In Greater China, Q4 revenue grew 9% on a currency-neutral basis. For the full year, Greater China delivered its 7th consecutive year of double-digit growth, demonstrating our consistent brand strength and commitment to serving the consumer. NIKE Direct grew 2% in Q4, with strong growth in NIKE owned stores, partially offset by declines in NIKE Digital. As John mentioned earlier, Q4 business results were impacted by marketplace dynamics. After a strong March, our business in Greater China was impacted in April, and we adjusted our operations by suspending marketing activities and product launches. We then began to see a recovery trend, improving to a single-digit decline in May and sequentially improving into June, with month-to-date retail sales trends approaching prior year levels. And for the 6/18 consumer moment, our flagship store on Tmall ranked number one, driving the highest demand across the sports industry. Building on our 40-year history in Greater China, we continue to invest in serving consumers with the best products Nike has to offer in locally relevant ways. We also continue to invest in the creation of a premium, seamless consumer digital experience and supply chain capabilities. And we plan to open a new digital technology center in Shenzhen to better serve Chinese consumers. We have an experienced local team in Greater China who helped create our operational playbook at the beginning of the pandemic. They have proactively managed marketplace supply and demand in order to navigate through these dynamics, and we expect inventory to be normalized by the end of Q2. Now moving to APLA, Q4 revenue grew 76% on a currency-neutral basis, with growth across all territories led by Japan, SOCO and Mexico. And Korea grew double digits this quarter on top of the 8% growth they delivered in the fourth quarter of last year. NIKE Digital grew more than 50%, enabled and amplified by our membership offense. This was highlighted by member days, which drove all-time highs for member demand. This momentum also extended to our marketplace partners in APLA as they return to growth versus pre-pandemic levels and achieved their highest level of full price realization since the beginning of the pandemic. During Golden Week in Japan, the Express Lane assortment was heavily influenced by member insights and delivered a sell-through rate that was 2x the rate of the rest of NIKE Digital in Japan, showcasing the power of blending art and science that John referenced earlier. APLA was the last geography to launch our Express Lane offense, and we see significant opportunity to leverage these capabilities to drive deeper, authentic consumer connections across the region. Now as we look ahead to fiscal \u201822 and beyond, I want to provide a new financial outlook through fiscal \u201825. As we emerge from the pandemic, accelerate our consumer direct strategy and transform the operating model of the company. First of all, NIKE is a growth company, and we expect to sustain strong revenue growth going forward. This is based on the significant market opportunity that we see for our brands across the portfolio as well as our accelerated shift to a more direct member-centric business model. As a result, we expect revenue growth to inflect upwards to a range of high single-digit to low double-digit growth on average with outsized marketplace opportunities in women\u2019s, apparel, Jordan, digital and international. Growth will be led by NIKE Direct and our strategic marketplace partners. Earlier, I mentioned NIKE Direct is approaching 40% of our brand business today, and we expect it to represent approximately 60% of the business in fiscal \u201825, led by growth in digital. And as John said earlier, we expect owned and partnered digital to achieve 50% business mix in fiscal \u201825 with NIKE owned digital to represent 40% of the business. We will continue reshaping our wholesale business portfolio, which includes divesting from undifferentiated retail while investing in our strategic wholesale partners for healthy growth. Overall, we expect wholesale revenue to remain roughly flat versus fiscal \u201821. We will support partners who continue to authenticate our brand as well as those who have the scale to create a consistent, premium, digitally connected experience for consumers across the marketplace. Our longer term revenue outlook reflects higher growth expectations across several operating segments. We will continue to leverage the power of our diverse global portfolio. And we expect, on average, North America to grow mid-single to high single digits, EMEA to grow high single digits and APLA to grow low double digits. And with respect to Greater China, while marketplace dynamics still exist, we are optimistic that we can continue to grow low to mid-teens over the long-term. We remain committed to investing in the local consumer experience and inspiring the next generation of athletes in China. We will continue to serve consumers with NIKE\u2019s performance innovation and sports style product franchises, while also increasing local customization of style and fit for consumers. For several quarters now, I\u2019ve highlighted that the strategic and financial benefit of shifting to a higher mix of business through NIKE Direct led by digital and leveraging enhanced data and analytics capabilities to optimize inventory, drive higher full price realization and lower digital fulfillment costs. We now see gross margin rate reaching the high 40s by fiscal \u201825. We will continue to reallocate resources and invest to enable our digital transformation and fuel the long-term growth and profitability opportunities that we see. Having said that, we expect to invest in SG&A at a rate that drives leverage versus pre-pandemic levels, which averaged roughly 32% to 33% of revenue. As a result of all of these, we see our EBIT margin reaching high teens by fiscal \u201825 with earnings per share growth of mid- to high teens on average over this period. As we drive towards a more direct business model, we remain committed to create long-term value for our shareholders through serving consumers and sustaining our disciplined financial management. We expect to deliver strong growth in free cash flow, maintain annual capital expenditures at roughly 3% of revenue, drive returns on invested capital above prior guidance of the low 30% range and deliver consistent returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Now that I\u2019ve discussed our updated financial outlook through fiscal \u201825, I will provide guidance for fiscal \u201822. As I\u2019ve already said, we entered the fiscal year strong, confident that our deep consumer connections and brand momentum will continue despite being in a dynamic operating environment. Our confidence is rooted in the fact that consumers in key cities rate NIKE as their favorite brand, that retail sales continue to grow strongly on lean marketplace inventory and our organization is aligned against our new consumer construct, which will help us accelerate even faster against our largest growth opportunities. In fiscal \u201822, we expect revenue to grow low double digits and surpass $50 billion, reflecting strong consumer demand across our operating segments as we lead with digital, scale NIKE owned physical retail concepts and grow with our strategic partners. It\u2019s important to note, as we normalize our post-pandemic business and continue to reshape the marketplace we do not expect quarter-by-quarter growth to be linear. Therefore, we expect first half growth to be slightly higher than second half growth. We expect gross margin to expand 125 to 150 basis points, reflecting our continued shift to a more profitable NIKE Direct business and sustained strong full price realization, partially offset by higher product costs, supply chain investments and the annualization of certain one-time benefits in fiscal \u201821. Foreign exchange is estimated to be a tailwind of roughly 70 basis points. We expect SG&A growth to slightly outpace revenue growth as we normalize spend with return to sport and more consistent store operating schedules as well as investments focused against our largest growth opportunities, which I have shared previously. However, we do expect leverage relative to pre-pandemic rates of investment. And last, we expect the fiscal \u201822 effective tax rate to be mid-teens. As we begin our next fiscal year, NIKE continues to navigate through a dynamic and rapidly changing environment. At the same time, we are on the offense and accelerating our strategy to serve more consumers personally and at scale. Our unmatched innovation continues to enable world-class athletes to reach new levels of performance as sport returns to the main stage. Our product pipeline is strong, and we are even more deeply connected to consumers than before the pandemic. We are building upon the strong foundation we set in fiscal \u201821 and accelerating our pace for the next leg of the race. We have a clear vision for our brand\u2019s long-term future, and we are focused on what it will take to get there. With that, we will now open up the call for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Bob Drbul : Yes. Good afternoon, and Paul Trussell, congratulations. And Andy, best of luck, and thanks for all the information today. I guess the first question that I have, can you spend a little more time on China? Exactly \u2013 I mean you gave us a lot of detail around how it\u2019s progressing. I guess I would be curious just to hear, when you think about the inventories and you think about how you are planning the next few quarters from a flow perspective, if you could give us a little more color just how you would plan China on the revenues, I guess either quarterly or just for the year based on the trends? Thanks. Matt Friend : Sure, Bob. And hello, and thanks for the question. As we think about the dynamics that we are managing through in China right now, we are optimistic as we continue to see improvement sequentially each month. As we think about fiscal \u201822 and the guidance we provided, we are planning for continued recovery throughout fiscal year \u201822, but we don\u2019t expect it to be linear. And what I would say is, longer term, we are optimistic given our history of operating in China and our connections and relationship with consumers that over the long term we will be able to deliver low-to-mid teens growth. Bob Drbul : Great. And I just have a question sort of \u2013 I guess it will be a North American question as a follow-up. But with LeBron out and KD out, you still have Giannis, and I just wondered if you think this is his year and you think he can bring the trophy home. John Donahoe : Well, we certainly hope so. If not LeBron, Devin Booker and if not Devin Booker, Paul George or many of the other NIKE athletes, and what\u2019s been one of the \u2013 just one of the great NBA Playoffs, I know we have all enjoyed the game. It\u2019s so great the sport is back. It\u2019s so great that the stands are full. So, the excitement that we feel with the entire NBA and frankly, all the great sport going on right now is palpable. Bob Drbul : Great. Thank you very much. John Donahoe : Thanks Bob. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Kimberly Greenberger : Great. Thanks so much, and thanks so much for the outlook here through 2025. There is a noticeable sort of inflection in the business that you are calling for here, and I can just hear the enthusiasm. So, I wanted to just ask about what are the sort of key underpinnings that\u2019s giving you confidence in the acceleration in the growth rate. And where do you see basically the support for this level of acceleration? What\u2019s driving that? Matt Friend : Sure, Kimberly. Well, as we have talked about throughout this year, we have continued to see the way that we have gotten closer to the consumer creating deeper connections, and as we look at how our brand is positioned around the world, we continue to be very optimistic with what we see. That\u2019s translated into very strong retail sales growth throughout the year. And in many circumstances, we have seen demand outstripping supply. As we think about the future, especially as we exit \u201821 and we move forward to \u201822, there are definitely specific things that give us optimism and confidence. John just mentioned one of them, which is the return to sport, and we are already starting to see an acceleration in our sport performance business. We are excited about the connections that we are driving from a digital perspective, especially as physical retail reopens. We believe that is a sticky shift that will continue, and that\u2019s embedded in our guidance for \u201822 and also the longer-term outlook that I provided for you. And that shift of \u2013 a 20-point mix shift in direct is definitely an inflection from a revenue \u2013 it creates an inflection from a revenue perspective. And then lastly, I would say that we continue to talk about the significant opportunities that we see more broadly in the marketplace. And while we have had momentum, and we continue to see those dimensions of business outstrip the growth of the rest of the business, the opportunity is still significant relative to our share in those specific areas. And so, what I am referring to there is our women\u2019s business and the opportunity we see in front of us, the apparel business and the opportunities that we see there, and then the momentum that we have with the Jordan Brand, in particular, and the opportunities that we see for that brand both in North America, but in international markets as well. Kimberly Greenberger : Very clear and so exciting. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Great. Thanks. Congrats on a really nice quarter and a really great hire. So John, maybe on the digital transformation, could you help outline what you think most differentiates your digital strategy to continue to build the marketplace leadership? And Matt, maybe with that, could you just help walk through the profitability of the digital channel as it relates to the algorithm that you outlined and maybe which line items it\u2019s most impacting? John Donahoe : Well, sure, Matthew. The first thing, never look a wonderful tailwind in the eye or look away from one. So, we have got a \u2013 there is a fundamental shift in consumer behavior toward digital. And that\u2019s been happening, but the pandemic has simply accelerated that. And that provides the opportunity for us to have a direct connection with consumers, which is increasingly important in a digital world where consumers, while they are going more digital are focusing on fewer and fewer apps. And we are going to be one of the very few apps that have a direct connection with consumers, and that\u2019s unlocking great growth. That\u2019s unlocking growth in our ability to serve them with more personalized shopping experiences, with recommendations across our vast product portfolio with services and other ways to engage them like NIKE Run Club, NIKE Training Club. So, we think we are one of the very few in our industry that will be able to establish that direct connection with consumers both around commerce, but also engage them on a weekly, monthly, quarterly basis. And then that produces great consumer insight, and that consumer insight has a bit of a virtuous cycle. The more you have of it, the more you can use it. You can use that consumer insight as I said earlier on, personalizing a recommendation or anticipating a need on replenishing a product when you know they are going to need it. It also drives efficiency in our operations, right. We talk about building a digital supply chain. What that\u2019s all about is having the intelligence to know, having the right product in the right place at the right time, so that we can deliver that product at a low-cost, convenient, and speedy and a climate-friendly way. And last, but not least, that insight \u2013 consumer insight helps fuel product creation. I mean the more we know about our consumers, the more we can build the kind of compelling product that they want and need. And so, we feel like \u2013 as Matt said, there is a virtuous cycle by embracing our digital transformation as aggressive as we are. We think we can create competitive separation. And so \u2013 and we still \u2013 we think it\u2019s going to be a journey that has continuous improvement and continuous ROI and benefits along the way. Matt Friend : Yes. And I would just add that the NIKE App or our app ecosystem continues to have a significant impact, and we are continuing to invest in the consumer experience in order to take advantage of the consumers\u2019 interest and appetite in engaging with our brand in that way. The app actually represents about 40% of our digital business at this point in time, and we are planning to launch the NIKE App in 10 more countries in fiscal year \u201822. As I think about the financial model, Matt as you asked, I sort of answered in my question to Kimberly, which is this shift to digital and that direct sale to the consumer is definitely causing us confidence to inflect our revenue outlook upwards as a first point. The second point I would say is that as we have continued to see over the past several quarters and really, if you sort of look through the pandemic, it\u2019s really over the last 3 years as we have been seeing more and more business being done through direct and digital. We have been talking about how that shift in mix has enabled us to drive and increase our gross margin expansion versus historical levels of gross margin expansion. And so that\u2019s what\u2019s embedded in that high-40s guidance outlook. It\u2019s continuing to shift to more direct business. And then within that direct business, we continue to see opportunities like I referenced, leveraging data and analytical capabilities, so digital transformation-type capabilities to know where to place our inventory, how to fulfill demand closer to the consumer, whether it\u2019s through our stores or through our regional service centers, how to think about pricing based on the way inventory is flowing and then continued demand and supply management. And then I guess the last thing I would say is that the way that we framed our SG&A guidance is that we feel confident that as we look at the transformation that\u2019s taking place in our business over the next 4 years that at that level of SG&A investment, which is better than where we were in the pandemic, we can fund the investments that we need to fuel this growth and sustain the opportunity that we have in front of us. Matthew Boss : Congrats on the momentum and the new multiyear model. Matt Friend : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler. Erinn Murphy : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess a follow-up question for the team on the China marketplace. Bigger picture, just with the accelerating growth of late and some of the national athletic brands, can you just share how you are thinking about NIKE\u2019s market share potential as you work through the 2025 plan within China specifically? And then secondly, if I could just ask on the women\u2019s business, it hit over $8.5 billion in this fiscal year. Could you just share kind of what your expectation is in the plan by 2025 and just the role you see some of the smaller footprint stores and the suite of apps you have developed playing in the progression there? Thank you so much. John Donahoe : Sure. Matt, why don\u2019t I take the first part and then maybe you take the second part of Erinn\u2019s question? Matt Friend : Sure. John Donahoe : So Erinn, bottom line, we are confident about what we are seeing in China as we drive long-term growth. And we have a long-term view about China. And we have always taken a long-term view. We have been in China for over 40 years. Phil invested significant time and energy in China in the early days. And today, we are the largest sport brand there, and we are a brand of China and for China. And the biggest asset we have in China is the consumer equity. Consumers feel a strong, deep connection to the NIKE, Jordan and Converse brands in China. And it\u2019s real. I saw that in my first week here, can\u2019t wait to get back there. And it\u2019s strong. And that\u2019s brought to life on streets all over China through the over 7,000 mono-brand stores we have in China. So, we have a strong consumer franchise in China, and they feel very connected to our brand. And so we are going to continue to invest. We will continue our long-term investment in China whether it\u2019s through the Express Lane, which allows us to have local product insights, so design and deliver with speed and agility or we are localizing our tech stack. Matt mentioned we are opening a new digital technology center in Shenzhen. And we are going to invest for the long-term, and we are encouraged by the momentum and we have confidence in the future. It\u2019s interesting. We have been the #1 sports brand in Tmall for a decade, and we are still #1 today once we open back up on it. Over the last month, we have added 1 million new members on Tmall through the 6/18 shopping holiday. And so we are focusing on what we can control. We are confident of our momentum and our position. And we will \u2013 as Matt outlined, we feel confident about our long-term growth in China. Matt Friend : Yes. And I will just jump in, Erinn, on women\u2019s. We \u2013 this might sound interesting, but we are the largest women\u2019s athletic brand in the world today at $8.5 billion. And we are very bullish on the opportunity for women\u2019s. We have been talking about it for several years. And it starts by what John said on the call, which is that the main purpose of our realigning our organizational structure was to try to amplify the investment at multiples of where we were previously investing against our women\u2019s business. And those investments are end-to-end, from specific innovation and the way we invest in innovation to the way we are investing in product creation, to the way that we are now investing in the marketplace through our NIKE Live concepts. And our NIKE Live stores are almost 50% women\u2019s sales, which are more than 15 points ahead of our other stores in terms of women\u2019s proportion of the revenue. And so it\u2019s definitely embedded and underlying our revenue outlook. And I would tell you that we expect to see women\u2019s outpace other elements of our business as we invest and drive against the long-term opportunity. Erinn Murphy : Great. That\u2019s super helpful, and congratulations to all. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore. Omar Saad : Thanks for taking my question. Great quarter. Congrats to everyone. High-teens operating margin target really is a huge breakout from historical trend and a lot of the long-term guidance that you guys have given over the years. Clearly, technology and NIKE\u2019s digital excellence is really the root of this kind of transformation we have all been talking about. I would love to hear \u2013 I saw that Converse continues to improve. I would love to hear you talk about how you are using that digital advantage and applying it at Converse. Is Converse starting to generate some of the benefits of these incredible technologies that you have developed under the Jordan and NIKE halo? I would love to hear more on those lines. Thanks. John Donahoe : Well, the short answer, Omar, is yes. I mean we are blessed with this wonderful portfolio of brands; Nike, Jordan and Converse. And they are additive. That\u2019s what\u2019s so striking is, while there is some consumer overlap, the role that each plays is additive in the eyes of the consumer. And so Scott and the Converse team are doing a great job of connecting with a distinct consumer and expanding \u2013 it\u2019s much like the Jordan playbook \u2013 expanding beyond just historical icons like the Chuck and bringing new design, new dimension to the product there. In fact, it\u2019s the fastest-growing part of their portfolio. We just had an operating review a couple of weeks ago and was really striking to see how they are extending that brand into both performance product into new ways to leverage that Converse brand and the product line as well as getting into apparel and going global. And so their digital capabilities are growing to have their own, as you know, in addition to being able to get to them on the NIKE website, and get to them on their own website. And their digital business is growing at very comparable levels as NIKEs are and Jordans are around the world. And so we see a lot of upside in the Converse opportunity and the Converse brand. Matt Friend : Yes. And we think that digital is going to play a really important role for Converse as they reshape the composition of their own marketplace. And so that\u2019s what\u2019s been driving growth for the last couple of quarters or for the last eight quarters, and it\u2019s continued to help us as they create that direct connection with consumers as well. Omar Saad : Got it. Thanks. Andy Muir : Operator we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Your last question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Adrienne Yih : Good afternoon. Thank you very much. Congratulations on the quarter and congratulations to Andy and Paul. My question is, Matt, on the $50 billion or greater than $50 billion for the out-year for fiscal \u201822, what is the expectation for China in that number? And I guess more specifically, in what quarter can we \u2013 or half of the year perhaps \u2013 can we expect to see China return to perhaps pre-pandemic trend rate? And which channel is going to be the most predictive : wholesale or direct/digital? Thank you very much. Matt Friend : Well, Adrienne, the \u2013 our FY \u201822 guidance reflects the optimism and the momentum that we are seeing across our full portfolio, brands and different geographies. As I mentioned on China, we are optimistic and encouraged based on the sequential improvements that we are seeing, so our business was impacted in April. It was down single digits in May, but improving, and approaching prior year levels in these first 3 weeks of June. Obviously, the 6/18 consumer moment gives us optimism as we continue this recovery. And we are planning for recovery throughout fiscal year \u201822, but we don\u2019t expect it to be linear. Adrienne Yih : Okay. Thank you very much. Andy Muir : Thank you, Adrienne. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Take care and stay safe. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Paul Trussell. Paul Trussell : Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE, Inc.\u2019s fiscal 2022 first quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today\u2019s call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, or at our website, investors.nike.com. Joining us on today\u2019s call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe; and our Chief Financial Officer, Matt Friend. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So, we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to one. Thank you for your cooperation on this. I will now turn the call over to Nike, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe. John Donahoe : Thanks, Paul, and hello to everyone on today\u2019s call. NIKE creates value through our relentless drive to serve the future of sport. And as we saw again in Q1, our strategy is working with business results that reflect our deep connection to consumers around the world. Thanks to our brand momentum, culture of innovation, commitment to purpose and proven operational playbook, we stay at the front of the pack. Q1 was another strong quarter for NIKE, with revenue growth of 16%. And even as we saw physical retail traffic return across much of the portfolio, digital continued its momentum with 25% currency-neutral growth, led by North America at over 40%. Our digital success is evident of the product innovation, brand strength and scale that drives our meaningful relationships with consumers as we continue to show momentum against our biggest growth priorities. As has been the case since the start of pandemic, I\u2019m proud of the way our entire NIKE Inc. team has delivered through macro volatility. Over the past 18 months, we\u2019ve demonstrated our ability to manage through turbulence to emerge even stronger and better positioned. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do as we navigate through these current supply chain issues. We\u2019ll focus on what we can control while leveraging the many levers at our disposal. You\u2019ll hear Matt walk through our mitigation efforts in a few minutes. Today, we\u2019re in a stronger position relative to our competition than we were prior to the pandemic. Why? Because the changes happening in the market work in our favor. Consumers\u2019 shift to digital that might have taken five years will now only take two. That plays to NIKE\u2019s advantage. And our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy is capitalizing on this marketplace transformation. We know that when we get to the other side of this, we\u2019ll be in even stronger shape. We\u2019ll be more agile, more direct and more digital. So, we remain focused and confident in our long-term business outlook. Our competitive advantages, including our innovative product, brand strength fueled by compelling storytelling, our roster of the world\u2019s best athletes and increasingly, our industry-leading digital experiences at retail will continue to create separation. As we drive strong, sustained consumer demand, our confidence remains undiminished. We\u2019ve just wrapped up an incredible summer of sport, highlighted, of course, by the Olympics and Paralympics. And moments like these are exciting for our company because sport energizes our roughly 75,000 employees around the world. You can just feel it. And it\u2019s through that passion for sport that we continue to innovate and connect to the consumer. And this summer in Tokyo, our leadership as the world\u2019s most innovative sports brand was demonstrated once again. If NIKE were a country, we would have eclipsed the competition, capturing 226 medals, including 85 golds. Here are a few examples of what excited us most this summer. We saw the emergence of Gen Z as a powerful next generation of athletes led by a pair of 13-year-old skateboarders who showed us the joy in the expansion of the definition of sport. We shined in key team sports, including football, where NIKE teams took home golds in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s and basketball, where NIKE and Jordan teams combined to take five of the six medals, including both golds. And we continued our great legacy in track and field with NIKE athletes winning more individual medals in track and field events than all other brands combined. And at the same time, the European Championships brought incredible energy to football in Q1 with England making it to the final. Our brand anthem, The Land of New Footfall, brought a fresh approach to the sport, representing NIKE\u2019s vision that in this game, everyone is welcome. The film saw more than 800 million impressions across all channels, as more than half of EMEA\u2019s Gen Z population viewed it at least once. And the summer sport also saw Giannis and the Milwaukee Bucks win the NBA title after an electrifying finals against Chris Paul, Devin Booker and the Phoenix Suns. Days later, we released Giannis\u2019 latest signature shoe, the Zoom Freak 3, which is built to support the dominant physicality that defines his style of play. We continue to see strong response to the Zoom Freak, and we\u2019re excited by what we\u2019re seeing with our growing Giannis business. And speaking of Devin Booker, Q1 was a great reminder of how we\u2019re investing in the next generation of superstars as we continue to build our roster of athletes. Jordan Brand signed the NFL\u2019s Dak Prescott in the quarter, joining emerging global icons in NIKE Inc.\u2019s family, including U.S. Open Winner, Emma Raducanu and Manchester United\u2019s Jadon Sancho. At the end of the quarter, the summer sport gave way to back-to-school season. So far this fall, we\u2019ve seen sell-through in our kids business up almost 30%, led by digital with growth of almost 70. As we focus on the kids opportunity, our new consumer construct through that, we are connecting with families more authentically than ever before. We\u2019re creating kid-specific designs and leveraging new channels for us to connect with these consumers. Take, for example, Playlist, which is a just-for-kids series on nike.com and YouTube. It\u2019s filled with games, challenges and exclusive athlete content, all aligned to our mission of encouraging movement in play. Its latest season began a few months back with a new video starring LeBron James and some of his costars from their movie Space Jam : A New Legacy. Playlist has been a hit with kids and parents alike with viewership numbers well above our expectations. And our kids business remains an important connection point for us, an organic incubator of the brand across multiple generations as we look long-term. We\u2019re the largest kids athletic footwear brand in the world, but we know that there is still so much potential ahead. And as I\u2019ve said before, at NIKE, everything starts with innovation. Our culture of innovation is our most profound competitive advantage. And this week, I toured our new LeBron James Innovation Center here at our world headquarters with LeBron. At over 750,000 square feet, this new home for our innovation teams is five times the size of our previous lab and is continued proof of NIKE\u2019s leadership in sports science. We expect this facility to act as an accelerant as it helps extend our advantage in innovation even further. And looking at our innovation agenda, the two areas that I\u2019d like to touch on today where our relentless pipeline of innovative product continues to create separation between us and our competition, apparel and sustainability. First, let\u2019s take a look at apparel. We\u2019re seeing strong over-indexing growth of 16% in this key growth driver. And the investments we\u2019re making in our new consumer construct are fueling higher apparel growth for women\u2019s led by our yoga business. Our yoga collection today features multiple industry-leading innovations, including Dri-FIT and Infinalon. These innovations are resonating with consumers and have helped us nearly quadruple our yoga business over the past two years. Another key apparel story for us in Q1 was our bras business. This quarter, we maintained our number 1 market share in sports bras in North America and introduced the NIKE Dri-FIT ADB Swoosh bra. Dri-FIT ADB combines the ultimate and cooling fabrics with highly engineered methods to make. It\u2019s an innovation that\u2019s connected with consumers as we scale this technology across our line. And now, to take a look at sustainability, look at what we\u2019ve done with Space Hippie. Space Hippie, as you may recall, is quite literally made from trash, and it was originally introduced at our 2020 Future Forum and debuted four separate sustainable material innovations for us, including Crater Foam and Space Waste Yarn. Now since then, we have strategically grown this franchise to global scale. And what\u2019s more, we\u2019ve also scaled these individual material innovations across our entire portfolio. So today, one year after that initial launch, there are more than 43 styles using Space Hippie innovations across four sports, three brands and our full consumer construct. For instance, you can see it come to life in iconic franchises such as the Air Force 1 Crater; new performance innovation platforms like COSMIC Unity, and even in our hands-free accessibility line with styles like Glide FlyEase. By driving new dimensions across platforms, our work-to-scale Space Hippie innovations catalyze growth. Consumers are clearly responding to sustainability, as we\u2019re seeing very strong full price sell-through for this family of product with vast opportunity to drive continued consumer and business value still ahead. And this is just one example of how we lead with platforms and not just products. Our deliberate franchise and innovation management create scalable and sustainable impacts on our business, and I\u2019m excited by the upcoming new innovation platforms we\u2019ll be introducing soon. Next, let\u2019s discuss NIKE\u2019s increasing digital advantage. We continue to lead the industry by creating a premium, consistent and seamless experience that deepens relationships between consumers and our brands. Our advantage comes to life at retail in both, digital as well as at the intersection of digital and physical. I\u2019ll discuss both here. Even as physical retail revenue approach pre-pandemic levels, our digital business this quarter grew double digits. This is the result of an unwavering focus on our strategy and the investments we\u2019ve made against our end-to-end digital transformation. And so, we continue to expect digital to be our leading channel for growth in fiscal \u201822. Now, one of the best gauges for success in our digital business is how strongly we\u2019re connecting with members. Our digital growth is led by outsized member buying, which has seen a penetration increase of 14 points since last year. Our membership strategy is working as we increasingly use data and analytics to personalize member product offering and experiences. And we\u2019re seeing this come to life as repeat buying members grew more than 70% in the quarter. Now, part of our success stems from our constant focus on expanding what it means to be a NIKE member. We brought this to life in Q1 by introducing a new launch experience exclusive to the SNKRS App that revolutionizes how we serve consumers. The new experience debuted in one of the year\u2019s most highly anticipated launches, the Off-White Dunk. For the launch last month, we rolled out our new elevated SNKRS exclusive access. This approach sends personalized purchase offers to members based on their engagement with SNKRS, past purchase attempts and other criteria, using data science to drive digital member targeting. For example, 90% of the invitees for the Off-White Dunk went to members who had lost out on a prior Off-White collaboration over the past two years. The result, the Off-White Dunk end up in the hands of hundreds of thousands of our most-deserving members, creating what we call, exclusivity at scale. And this improved consumer experience has a positive impact on the entire business. We\u2019ve seen that those who benefit from exclusive access on SNKRS spend more across NIKE, fueled by the energy of their win. So, our increasingly personalized approach to launch, along with benefits like member days and exclusive NIKE By You access, highlights how we continue to increase the value proposition of NIKE membership. We\u2019re also leveraging our digital advantage by investing in our brick-and-mortar fleet to create a compelling retail footprint that supercharges how we serve consumers across physical and digital. A couple of weeks ago, I was in Los Angeles and toured some of our great retail there. I got to see a wide variety of stores, including our NIKE Live door in Long Beach, a community door in East L.A. and more. And across each and every store, what jumped out to me was our team. Their love for their community and their passion for our product and bringing it to life for consumers was inspiring and just awesome to see. I also enjoyed visiting a few strategic partner doors, including DICK\u2019s and Foot Locker. What\u2019s clear across the marketplace, both owned and partnered, is how online to offline is becoming second nature. We know that higher levels of connectivity across physical and digital are driving better consumer experience and loyalty. O2O services such as buy online, pick up in store and ship from store as well as the in-store shopping features of the NIKE App, drive our premium and seamless consumer experience. And we\u2019re starting to extend these innovative experiences globally. In Q1, we brought our NIKE Rise, an immersive concept to Seoul. NIKE Seoul introduces new features to live -- or Rise, rather, including Inside Track, an interactive RFID-enabled digital footwear table where shoppers can compare details for any two shoes, simply by placing them on the table. Our digitally connected retail experiences are clearly resonating with consumers. This quarter, our in-line fleet grew over 70% in revenue, approaching pre-pandemic levels. We\u2019re seeing over-index growth from members, not just at digital but also at physical retail, with member-buying penetration up double digits since last year. And so, we\u2019ll continue expanding these compelling experiences across our fleet in fiscal \u201822, driving that interplay between physical and digital retail. In the end, NIKE is doing what we always do, staying on the offense. The strength of our consumer demand around the world continues to give us confidence in our playbook and execution. I said it earlier and I\u2019ll say it again, I am proud of our resilient and creative team across NIKE, Jordan and Converse, and the work we continue to deliver for consumers. Our confidence as we look long term has not changed one bit. We\u2019ve already gotten stronger through this pandemic, and we\u2019re going to emerge from it even stronger yet. And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Matt. Matt Friend : Thank you, John, and hello to everyone on the call today. NIKE\u2019s acceleration to a more direct member-centric business model continues to fuel deep connections between consumers and our portfolio of brands. Drawing upon our culture of innovation, unmatched global scale and our industry-leading digital platform, we continue to serve the modern consumer as only NIKE can. Our first quarter results proved again that our strategy is working. And NIKE\u2019s Consumer Direct Acceleration is fueling the transformation of our long-term financial model. Our relentless focus on serving the consumer translated into revenue growth of 16% and EBIT growth of 22% versus the prior year. The NIKE Brand remains distinctive and deeply connected in our key cities around the world. From New York to Paris, Shanghai to Tokyo, NIKE continues to be consumers\u2019 number one cool and favorite brand with a position that has gained strength as we\u2019ve navigated through the pandemic. Consumer demand for NIKE, Jordan and Converse, remains incredibly high, and our first quarter financial results would have been even stronger, if not for supply chain congestion, resulting in lack of available supply. Despite these headwinds, retail sales still grew double digits versus the prior year, including a record-setting back-to-school season in North America. SNKRS has increasingly become an indicator and barometer of brand heat now being operational at scale in 50 countries around the world. NIKE Digital is now 21% of total NIKE brand revenue, which is an increase of 2 points versus last year with strong double-digit growth versus the prior year, even with broad reopening of physical retail. Digital is increasingly becoming a part of everyone\u2019s shopping journey, and we are well positioned to reach our vision of a 40% owned digital business by fiscal \u201825. And coming back to marketplace health for a moment, we delivered strong growth in average selling price this quarter with continued improvement in full price realization. This performance reflects our intentional efforts to manage the health of our product franchises as demand surges, to move available inventory to serve demand in the right channels and to drive a more premium experience for consumers. This quarter, we exceeded our 65% full price sales realization goal, which reflects the expectations that we put forward at our last Investor Day. As we accelerate our consumer-led digital transformation, we are developing and refining new capabilities that are transforming our operating model, quickly becoming a competitive advantage for NIKE. Central to these capabilities is scaling our digital-first supply chain to enable NIKE\u2019s digital growth while optimizing service, cost, convenience and sustainability. We are evolving our distribution network and forward deploying inventory closer to the consumer, leveraging data and advanced analytics. These actions will improve service levels, reduce carbon impact and ultimately reduce cost to fulfill an order. Our regional service center outside of Los Angeles opened one year ago, and we\u2019re excited with the opening of two more centers in Q1, one in the East Coast and one in Spain. Our investments in O2O services are putting our products in the path of more consumers and more efficiently optimizing our inventory. Today, we have at least two O2O services in each of our NIKE-owned stores in the U.S., and we are aggressively scaling these services across the globe. Our Express Lane offense is also creating more and more agility across our portfolio, from creating locally relevant product on shorter lead times to leveraging a shared inventory pool across the marketplace, we are better conserving consumers with more operational flexibility, yielding higher profitability. This quarter, Express Lane grew roughly 20% versus the prior year and increased its share of overall business. And last, the NIKE App continues to enable a convergence between physical and digital shopping journeys, eliminating friction for consumers. From member-driven personalization and localization to building an endless aisle through digital integration with our most important wholesale partners, Consumer Direct Acceleration is transforming NIKE\u2019s operating model to move at the speed of the consumer. Now, let me turn to the details of our first quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 16% and 12% on a currency-neutral basis, with growth across all marketplace channels. NIKE Digital grew 25% and NIKE-owned stores grew 24%. Wholesale grew 5% in the quarter, negatively impacted by lower available inventory supply due to worsening transit times. Gross margin increased 170 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by higher NIKE Direct margins and partially offset by increased ocean freight surcharges. SG&A grew 20% versus the prior year. This was due to higher wage-related expenses, higher levels of brand activity connected to return to sport and strategic technology investments. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 11% compared to 11.5% for the same period last year. This was due to increased benefits from stock-based compensation and discrete items, offset by a shift in our earnings mix. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.16, up 22% versus the prior year. Now, let\u2019s move to our operating segments. In North America, Q1 revenue grew 15% and EBIT grew 10%. Demand for NIKE remained incredibly strong for the fifth consecutive season, energized this fifth consecutive season, energized this quarter by back-to-school and the return-to-sport. Retail sales for our performance business grew strong double digits during the fall season, led by running, fitness and basketball, powered by excitement from the Olympics, the new WNBA season and the NBA finals. NIKE Direct grew more than 45%, with NIKE Digital now representing 26% share of business. Digital continued its momentum and grew more than 40%, increasing market share by outperforming industry trends with strong growth in traffic and repeat buying member activity. The return to physical retail accelerated NIKE-owned store growth of over 50% as we serve members with elevated experiences. NIKE-owned inventory increased 12% versus the prior year. This was driven by highly elevated in-transit inventory levels as transit times in North America deteriorated during the last quarter, now almost twice as long as pre-pandemic levels. This impacted product availability across the marketplace and our ability to serve strong levels of consumer demand, particularly in the wholesale channels. Closeout inventory was down double digits versus the prior year. In EMEA, Q1 revenue grew 8% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT grew 26% on a reported basis. This region was energized by the Euros this summer, where NIKE players scored more goals than all other brands combined, and more than half of those goals were with our material boots. We saw a strong consumer response to both the material boot and replica jerseys during the tournament. NIKE Direct grew 10% on a currency-neutral basis, led by our NIKE-owned stores. Following a full reopening, we saw traffic increase by double digits versus the prior year with better-than-expected conversion rates. In EMEA, while NIKE Digital grew 2% in the quarter, demand for full-price products grew nearly 30% as we compare to higher liquidation levels in the prior year. NIKE-owned inventory declined 14% on a reported basis with closeout inventory down double digits. Transit times to EMEA have also deteriorated over the past 90 days, causing higher levels of in-transit inventory and negatively impacting product availability to serve strong consumer demand. In Greater China, Q1 revenue grew 1% on a currency-neutral basis. EBIT grew 2% on a reported basis as the team delivered in line with our own recovery expectations. Retail sales were impacted in late July and August due to regional closures and lower levels of foot traffic due to COVID containment. Prior to late July, physical traffic had been approaching prior year levels. In July, we engaged with consumers through the launch of our Joy of Sports, local marketing campaign. This campaign generated over 1 billion local views, demonstrating strong brand connection with Chinese consumers. NIKE Direct declined 3% on a currency-neutral basis, partially impacted by retail closures. NIKE Digital declined 6% as we compare to higher liquidation in the prior year, partially offset by double-digit improvement in full price sales mix. We experienced a strong 6/18 consumer moment where we grew nearly 10% versus the prior year and remained the number one sports brand on Tmall. Demand in our SNKRS App grew more than 130% for the quarter. Our experienced local team continues to navigate through marketplace dynamics. We finished the quarter with healthy marketplace weeks of supply, and inventory normalization is on plan. Now moving to APLA. First quarter revenue grew 31% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT grew 72% on a reported basis. Revenue growth was led by SOCO, Japan, Mexico and Korea, with more muted growth in Pacific and Southeast Asia and India due to COVID restrictions and government-mandated store closures. NIKE Digital grew more than 60% on a currency-neutral basis, highlighted by the expansion of our NIKE App. In June, the app went live in Mexico and 6 additional countries across Southeast Asia, generating 3 million local downloads during the quarter. Earlier on the call, John spoke about the new NIKE Rise retail experience in Seoul. To mark the opening of the store, our Express Lane, SNKRS and NIKE Rise teams created the NIKE Seoul Dunk. This collaboration drove more than half of day one sales and highlight how digital and physical experiences are converging in our own stores, leveraging local insights and a more agile supply model. Now, I will turn to our financial outlook. Consumer demand for NIKE remains at an all-time high, and we are confident that our deep consumer connections and brand momentum will continue. However, we are not immune to the global supply chain headwinds that are challenging the manufacture and movement of product around the world. Previously, I had shared that we for transit times to remain elevated for the balance of fiscal \u201822. Unfortunately, the situation deteriorated even further in the first quarter, with North America and EMEA seeing increases in transit times due primarily to port and rail congestion and labor shortages. Additionally, several of our factory partners in Vietnam and Indonesia were required to abruptly cease operations in the first quarter. As of today, Indonesia is now fully operational. But in Vietnam, nearly all footwear factories remain closed by government mandate. Our experience with COVID-related factory closures suggest that reopening and ramping back to full production scale will take time. Therefore, we\u2019re revising our short-term financial outlook to incorporate the following factors : 10 weeks of production already lost in Vietnam since mid-July; factory reopening to occur in phases beginning in October with a ramp to full production over several months; and elevated transit times, consistent with where we are now operating today. We now expect fiscal \u201822 revenue to grow mid-single digits versus the prior year versus our prior guidance of low double-digit growth, due solely to the supply chain impacts that I just described. Specifically for Q2, we expect revenue growth to be flat to down low single digits versus the prior year as factory closures have impacted production and delivery times for the holiday and spring seasons. Lost weeks of production, combined with longer transit times, will lead to short-term inventory shortages in the marketplace for the next few quarters. We expect all geographies to be impacted by these factors. However, those geographies in Asia with less in-transit inventory at the end of the first quarter will experience a disproportionate impact beginning in Q2. For the balance of fiscal \u201822, we expect strong marketplace demand to exceed available supply. We are optimistic inventory supply availability will improve heading into fiscal \u201823, against the backdrop of a very strong brand and healthy pull market across all geographies. Turning to the rest of the P&L, we still expect gross margin to expand 125 basis points versus the prior year, at the low end of our prior guidance, reflecting stronger-than-expected full price realization, the ongoing shift to our more profitable NIKE Direct business and price increases in the second half. This more than offsets roughly 100 basis points of additional transportation, logistics and air freight costs to move inventory in this dynamic environment. We also expect a lower foreign exchange benefit, now estimated to be a tailwind of roughly 60 basis points. And for the second quarter, we expect gross margin to expand at a rate lower than the full year due to higher planned airfreight investment for the holiday season. We expect SG&A to grow mid to high teens. We intend to maintain our position as the number one cool and favorite brand and to celebrate the return to sport as we inspire and engage consumers around the world. We will also maintain pace on our multiyear investment plans in order to transform our business for the future, as I\u2019ve outlined in prior quarters. NIKE\u2019s financial strength is a competitive advantage, and it is in moments like these where our competitive strengths and strong balance sheet affords us the ability to remain focused on what\u2019s required to win and serve consumers for the long term. In closing, our vision for NIKE\u2019s long-term future remains unchanged. NIKE is a growth company with unlimited potential. Despite new short-term operational dynamics, our Consumer Direct Acceleration offense is driving our business forward and transforming our financial model toward the long-term fiscal \u201825 financial outlook I shared last quarter. This quarter\u2019s impressive results are additional proof that our strategy is right, not only for the moment we find ourselves in, but also for the opportunity to serve the future of athletes and sport like only NIKE can. I wouldn\u2019t trade our position with anyone, and there is no better team to navigate through volatility and lead long-term transformational change. With that, let\u2019s open up the call for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler. Erinn Murphy : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. And I really appreciate the update on what you\u2019re seeing real-time in the supply chain. I guess, my question relatedly is, are there any -- if you look to the fall and back half -- or holiday season, are there any key footwear franchises that are being more impacted than others? And then, when you zoom back and think about the longer-term, what type of investments do you plan to continue to make within the supply chain to continue to improve your agility? Thanks so much. Matt Friend : Well, Erinn, thanks for the question. There are several aspects to the current supply chain challenges that are probably not intuitive, just based on my prepared remarks. And so, let me take a couple of minutes to try to break it down further. As I said earlier, consumer demand has never been higher, and we expect strong demand to continue for quarters to come. Over the last 90 days, two things have happened in the industry that we didn\u2019 t anticipate : first, already long transit times worsened; and second, local governments mandated shutdowns in Vietnam and Indonesia. Keep in mind that there are global complexities and differences in transit times and sourcing mix across our geographies. So, I\u2019m going to use North America as an example to just go a little deeper on what I\u2019m talking about. Prior to the pandemic, it would have taken approximately 40 days to move product from Asia to North America. Transit times have been increasing due to container shortages, port congestion, rail congestion and labor shortages, impacting the entire industry. And during Q1, these lead times worsened further to now sit at 80 days, roughly two times normal. So, here\u2019s where the geo-specific piece comes in. So, as we finished Q1 with higher levels of in-transit inventory, that means that we had full price inventory that was unavailable to use to serve current consumer demand in this quarter. We would have had an even stronger top line result if we had more product available to serve that consumer demand. And so, these elevated transit times that we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019ve been talking about them now for several quarters, and they worsened this quarter, continue to have an impact on our business. And then in addition to that, there\u2019s Vietnam. And it\u2019s important to think about these two impacts together. As of today, 80% of our footwear factories located in the south and nearly half of our apparel factories in Vietnam are currently closed. So, through this week, that means we\u2019ve already lost 10 weeks of production, and that gap will continue until factories are able to reopen and produce product at normal capacity. So, this has created a gap to the flow of inventory, originally ordered for delivery beginning in mid-October. And our experience shows us, based on navigating through this pandemic over the last 18 months that it\u2019s going to take several months to ramp back to full production. Now, on a positive note, a few factories have just had their reopening plans approved, like this week. And so, we\u2019re optimistic about a phase reopening and ramp of production beginning in October. And as I said in the call -- earlier in the call, Indonesia is already operational, and they\u2019re ramping back up to capacity. So, North America is coming into Q2 with elevated and transit inventory which means North America will have higher quantities of fall season product that it can sell in the second quarter. But holiday and spring production has been delayed. And if you combine that with longer lead times, the impact of the lost production is going to have a greater impact in North America in Q3. Conversely, Greater China, which has lower levels of in-transit inventory and shorter transit times because it\u2019s closer to the factories, is going to experience the impact of the lost production earlier in Q2. Our teams are leveraging their experience in our operational playbook and taking actions to try to mitigate these impacts. And they\u2019re doing things like maximizing our footwear production capacity in other countries, shifting apparel production out of Vietnam to other countries like Indonesia and China and others where viable, strategically leveraging airfreight. And then, we\u2019re continuing to employ a seasonless approach to product to serve incredibly strong consumer demand, given our success that we\u2019ve had selling at full price, even if the product reaches the market later than we expected. So, while the environment is dynamic, these supply chain issues we believe are temporary. And from what we can see today, we\u2019re optimistic that available inventory supply will be improved as we head into fiscal year \u201823. John Donahoe : And Erinn, to the second part of your question on -- in that context investment, we\u2019re doing what strong companies do during periods of time like this. We\u2019re going to continue to invest in innovation and product creation, in brand and storytelling and support of sport being back and our strong sports marketing portfolio and our digital transformation. So, that\u2019s continuing. And then, we\u2019ll continue with strong presence around driving demand and brand even in the face of a supply-constrained market, and as Matt mentioned, accelerate air transportation and other things in our supply chain that allow us to take -- manage every lever we can in this supply chain-constrained environment. So, we\u2019re going to -- again, our mantra going into this next phase is the same mantra we had going into the first phase of the pandemic. Let\u2019s make sure we emerge stronger coming out of it than we have even today going in. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Great. Thanks. So, John, maybe could you speak to the overall health of the athletic industry? How best to think about overall TAM for NIKE as we exit the pandemic? Can you leverage size, scale and innovation to accelerate market share? And then, Matt, real quick, just on the revised gross margin outlook for this year, aside from the supply chain impact, I guess, my question is, could you speak to maybe some of the underlying drivers? It sounds like full price selling digital margin is on track. Meaning aside from the supply chain dynamics, does anything really change? Meaning do you see this as fully transitory, any change to the multiyear gross margin outlook? John Donahoe : Well, Matthew, on the first part of your question, the healthy athletic market is in our remarks. Sport is back. And that is just such an energizing and important thing for NIKE. And we saw that this summer. I won\u2019t go back through it, whether it\u2019s the Olympics, basketball, global football, incredible U.S. Open Tennis; it goes college football, U.S. football back. I mean, it\u2019s -- so I would say traditional sports is what I\u2019ll call it, is strong and back. And that\u2019s also happening now in high schools and grade schools as kids come back to school. Second thing we\u2019re seeing is the expansion of the definition of sport, whether that\u2019s in the Olympics with sports like skate being included for the first time. Some of the most exciting moments in the Olympics was around skate, right, and as that young generation, Gen Z generation really dominating remarkably in a very compelling way. But also coming out of pandemic, the definition of sport, I think, is getting to every athlete -- asterisk in different ways, just the concept of movements and health, and the fact that sport can happen in your living room as well as going to the gym or the yoga studio or the basketball court. And so, part of the tailwind we\u2019re seeing is sport is becoming part of everyone\u2019s everyday life. And that\u2019s a powerful tailwind for us. And then, athleisure, that\u2019s blurring the line between the sport part of your life and the rest of your life, is also what we view as a tailwind. So, we\u2019re doubling down on traditional sport, on capitalizing on these -- the new emerging definition of sport. You saw that in skate in the Olympics. You see that in some of our brand campaigns being really close to where that Gen Z consumer is. And we think that bodes well for our future. Matt Friend : And I\u2019ll just hit the gross margin quickly, Matt. We believe that this quarter was an excellent proof point of the success that we\u2019re seeing in driving our consumer-led digital transformation. We\u2019re seeing meaningful movement forward in both, NIKE Direct mix of business and also NIKE Digital mix of business, as I mentioned. And that\u2019s what fueled our gross margin expansion in the first quarter, high levels of full price realization, greater mix of NIKE Direct and NIKE Digital business and lower markdowns as we leverage the capabilities that we have to serve consumer demand, how and where they want it. As we look longer term, we\u2019re absolutely continuing to look towards that high-40s gross margin outlook that we provided last quarter. And in the short term, we\u2019re going to navigate through these transitory impacts. But, when you\u2019ve got a strong brand and you\u2019ve got a healthy pull market, what we\u2019re seeing is strong full price margins offsetting some of these transient costs that we\u2019re going to experience as we move product around the world. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : Maybe, John, could you click into the China trends a little bit more in the quarter? I guess, John -- on that. Last quarter, you spoke to some of the trends within the quarter after the impact in April to help us give an understanding of the path back to what was headed back to normal at the time. Any kind of dimensions this quarter? You mentioned there are some COVID lockdowns in a few markets that weighed on the total China trend. Maybe where we\u2019re at in 2Q to date and what you see is the right pace to think about getting back to normal in that market? And then, on North America, to the extent that you do need to make decisions in the allocations of the inventory going forward, I know you had a good amount in transit that can feed into 2Q, but how should we think about how you\u2019re thinking about allocation between the DTC channel and wholesale as we roll forward from here? Is it similar dynamics to what we saw in the first quarter, or any change in that trajectory? John Donahoe : Matt, why don\u2019t I take the first part of Mike\u2019s question, you take the second for North American. On China, Michael, I\u2019ll just reiterate what I said last quarter, is we take a long-term view in China, we\u2019ll invest for the long term, and we\u2019re confident in the long-term opportunity. And coincidentally, this is the 40th -- this month is the 40th anniversary of NIKE\u2019s participation in China. And, we saw Q1 results that were roughly in line with our expectations. And as Matt said, supply constraints will impact our second quarter performance. But, we are continuing to do what frankly Phil has done from the beginning in China, which he\u2019s done over the last 40 years and we\u2019ve done and we will continue to do over the next 40, which is deliver innovative product that connects with local consumers, strong consumer connections to our brand, partly reinforced by the 7,000 monobrand stores across the country. We\u2019re blessed to have a really strong local team, and I am so proud of that team, how they\u2019re navigating through. As we\u2019ve said many times before, they have led us in the sort of pandemic playbook and they continue to be very responsive on the ground there. And then, we always have been and will continue to be, very respectful and responsible corporate citizens, promoting sport and the wellbeing through activity and promoting sustainability and other important societal themes. And so, we\u2019ll continue to stay on that playbook and invest with consistency and longevity during this period of time. Matt Friend : And just transitioning to North America, we\u2019ve continued to deliver strong growth in that marketplace. I mentioned five consecutive quarters of -- or seasons, I should say, of incredibly strong demand. As we think about the marketplace, our approach is really no different than we\u2019ve been talking about for a couple of years now. We start through the eyes of the consumer. Where is the consumer shopping? How is the consumer engaging with our brand across the marketplace? And we\u2019re going to continue to focus on prioritizing our product availability for those locations where the consumer is shopping, and that will continue to be within NIKE\u2019s own channels and our most strategic wholesale partners. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to continue to do to serve that demand. The marketplace, as I said, is going to be lean. We\u2019re going to have lean inventory across the marketplace. But, NIKE and our partners will continue to try to create the best consumer experience that we can throughout the remainder of that -- of this fiscal year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Bob Drbul : Just two questions. The first one is on the spending levels. With the updated outlook on the revenue with the disruption of the supply chain, can you just help us understand how you\u2019re thinking about spending against the lower levels of revenue, whether it\u2019s demand creation or the investment technologies? And I have a follow-up. Matt Friend : Sure. Thanks, Bob. The year-over-year comparisons, as we\u2019ve talked about for a while here, are not really intuitive. And a couple of quarters ago, I talked about, as we were starting to see the strength in consumer connections and the acceleration of our business, that we were going to begin accelerating investment to drive our digital transformation. And in particular, where we were investing was against technology, our digital -- creating a digital-first supply chain and the marketplace. And we created a multiyear investment plan against our outlook to drive that growth. And when we finished the first quarter, we finished our first quarter spending at about 29% of revenue. And as we think about the transitory nature of these impacts, we believe this is a moment where NIKE\u2019s financial strength is a real competitive advantage. And so, we believe that these short-term dynamics will pass, but we\u2019re more convinced and committed to what we believe the capabilities we need to operate a consumer direct business at scale as we execute the strategy. And so, that\u2019s where our focus and attention is going to be. We\u2019re going to keep our teams focused on creating those capabilities and which we\u2019re seeing translate into strong growth and profitability. And that also includes the investments that we\u2019re making from a brand perspective. Strong brands get stronger in this environment. And having that deep consumer connection, especially when it\u2019s rooted to sport and the return of sport is absolutely what we need to be doing in order to continue to stay in a position of strength. Bob Drbul : Great. And if I could just sneak one more in. I think, the Drake NOCTA line dropped today, or -- I just wondered if you might give us some learnings on what you think about how that product is going and the opportunity that you have for something like that? John Donahoe : Bob, I am so glad you asked. I had a SNKRS win this morning on the NOCTA line, the vest. I\u2019m excited. It\u2019s a great collection. Any time you went on SNKRS, it\u2019s a jolt. I was in the middle of my workout in one of our gyms here on campus. I stopped the workout at 7 a.m. to see if I won, and I won. So, I\u2019m pumped up about that, as our -- as we said earlier, in all seriousness, millions and millions of SNKRS users. What a great experience. And obviously, that line is just another example of how NIKE is unparalleled in our ability to create real innovative, stylish, heat and connection with the consumer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets. Simeon Siegel : Just when thinking about your price elasticity of demand, so recognizing the unit pressures you\u2019re talking about with inventory. Can you just talk about maybe the opportunity or order of magnitude for potential pricing you see? And then, Matt, any way just to parse out the change in wholesale performance this quarter between the undifferentiated partners and then the strategic partners that you\u2019re continuing to support? Thanks. Matt Friend : Yes. So, on the pricing question, we -- I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we\u2019ve taken some pricing actions in the second half. And what I would say, Simeon, is that we evaluate price value of our products on a season-by-season basis. And we consider a number of different factors that we incorporate to make a decision about what to do. But, what I will tell you is that we take a long -- we have a long-standing relationship with our consumer. And so, we take a long-term view to these types of decisions. And so, the price increases that we\u2019ve implemented in the second half are in the low single-digit range. And we feel it\u2019s appropriate given the marketplace we\u2019re operating in and those other factors that I referenced, considering we\u2019ve got rising input costs and other factors that are impacting our business. But, I think it\u2019s really important not to drive past the fact that we continue to see strong growth in ASPs across the whole marketplace, driven by higher full price realization as we\u2019ve been talking about for several quarters and lower markdowns, and leveraging the capabilities of identifying our inventory, knowing where we want to put it, putting it in the path of the consumer, optimizing it between ourselves and our physical locations, our digital locations and increasingly providing that endless access to some of our wholesale, to some of our most strategic wholesale partners. All of these things are contributing to a higher level of full price realization across the marketplace. And so, we do believe that this is a base from where we want to operate as opposed to a moment in time. And that\u2019s driving profitability for NIKE at a moment that -- where there\u2019s lots of disruption. I think in terms of your second question in terms of undifferentiated or differentiated, what I would tell you is that we continue to see strong growth in our differentiated partners. And our differentiated partners because of the fact that they are creating a better consumer experience and driving more demand, their weeks of inventory on hand is about half where they would like for it to be right now because of the strong demand that they\u2019re driving. And to take it a step further, over the last three years, we\u2019ve actually exited about 50% of our undifferentiated accounts while we\u2019ve been able to deliver strong double-digit growth. And so, we believe that we will continue down this strategy. And as John alluded to in his prepared remarks, we believe that the supply-related reductions will likely trigger an even greater acceleration in the transformation of the marketplace towards NIKE and our most important wholesale partners. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Kimberly Greenberger : Great. Thank you so much. And really, really great color on the call today. Thank you. Matt, I wanted to just talk through the resumption in production and when you see inventory levels normalizing, assuming that production resumes through that October, November time frame that you laid out. As you sort of think about your lead times, the low inventory levels, when do you think, in calendar year 2022, you\u2019re going to feel really comfortable about having gotten caught up on the inventory that is holding back revenue growth here over the next few quarters? Thanks so much. Matt Friend : Sure. Well, Kimberly, our optimism stems from the fact that our factories are starting to have reopening plans approved. And that has happened this week. And so, we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019re going to start to see production begin in October. Our experience from the COVID-related closures in China earlier in the pandemic and then in Indonesia earlier this quarter tells us that it will take time for those factories to ramp back up to full capacity. We\u2019ve lost 10 weeks of production since mid-July. And so, what we\u2019re really focused on is, are our factory partners getting back to full capacity so that we can serve demand that we see in the marketplace. When we combine the lost production and the re-ramping plus the extended lead times, we feel optimistic that we\u2019re going to see inventory supply improving as we exit this fiscal year and move into fiscal year \u201823. And our experience would tell us that while this situation is going to be dynamic and it\u2019s not going to be linear, that\u2019s what we\u2019re planning towards at this point in time. John Donahoe : And I might just build on that, Kimberly, to say, both Matt and I wish we had a crystal ball, but we don\u2019t. And one of the things that I think we are demonstrating through this very dynamic phase is regardless of what the future holds, we\u2019re capitalizing on it, right? We\u2019re doing what great sports teams do, which is making -- confronting the reality, making adjustments, showing agility and executing in a way where we emerge stronger. And so, we had demand shocks last year with the closing of retail in the phase 1 of pandemic. And now we\u2019ve got some supply shocks with phase 2 of the pandemic this year. We will navigate through those just as we did last year. I think we\u2019re stronger today than we were 18 months ago and we\u2019ll be stronger 18 months from now than we are today. And in the process, we\u2019re building that capability where we\u2019re leveraging our strengths and we\u2019re leveraging the leadership position. And I just want to maybe conclude this call, Paul, by once again, just expressing my sincere thanks and appreciation for the 75,000 NIKE teammates around the world, who day in and day out are adjusting to the circumstances on the field, are demonstrating teamwork and resilience and creativity to serve consumers and continuing to innovate. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do regardless of what the future deals us. Paul Trussell : Thank you, Kimberly, for the question, and thanks to all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Take care and stay safe. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference call. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

To the extent nonpublic financial and statistical information is discussed, presentations of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations will be made available at NIKE\u2019s website, http://investors.nike.com. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Paul Trussell. Paul Trussell : Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE, Inc.\u2019s fiscal 2022 second quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today\u2019s call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, or at our website, investors.nike.com. Joining us on today\u2019s call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe; and our Chief Financial Officer, Matt Friend. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So, we would appreciate you limiting your initial questions to one. Thank you for your cooperation on this. I will now turn the call over to Nike, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe. John Donahoe : Thanks, Paul, and hello and happy holidays to everyone on today\u2019s call. Before I get into our quarterly performance, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the recent passing of Virgil Abloh. Since 2016, Virgil has been a beloved member of the Nike, Jordan and Converse family. He was a brilliant creative force who shared a passion for challenging the status quo and pushing forward a new vision while inspiring multiple generations along the way. But what stood out to me personally about Virgil was his humility and his humanity. We offer our condolences to the many who shared a connection with Virgil. He will be missed greatly. As we look at Q2, the creativity resilience of our entire NIKE, Inc. team helped deliver another strong quarter. The results we delivered offered continued proof that our strategy is working, even as we execute through global macroeconomic constraints. Whenever there\u2019s turbulence, I always go back to the fundamentals. And for NIKE, that means putting the consumer at the center and leveraging our long-term competitive advantages, which include a culture deeply rooted in innovation, a brand that deeply connects with consumers fueled by compelling storytelling, and an unmatched sports marketing portfolio. And we believe a fourth emerging competitive advantage for us is digital, as we\u2019re one of the few brands that can directly connect with and serve consumers at scale. We also continue to benefit from structural tailwinds that have accelerated during the pandemic, tailwinds that include a larger movement of health and fitness that is taking place around the world, consumers\u2019 desire to wear athletic footwear and apparel in all moments of their lives and expanding definition of sport, and last, a fundamental shift in consumer behavior toward digital plays to our increasing digital advantage. As I said before, challenges create opportunities for the strong brands to get stronger, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here. And we are now in a much stronger competitive position today than we were 18 months ago and that trend continues. We\u2019re seeing the strength come to life this holiday season. Our brand\u2019s deep connection with the consumers driving strong holiday sales, most notably with North American digital, leading the industry over Black Friday week with close to 40% growth; and our Singles\u2019 Day performance showcased our brand strength in Greater China as we added 13 million new members, and NIKE was again the number one sport brand on Tmall. More broadly, this holiday season has shown the power of our digital transformation across the globe. Digital is the engine driving our consumer direct acceleration strategy. And Q2 was also another incredible quarter for sport, led by our deep roster of athletes and teams. Let me just touch on a few of the highlights from the quarter. Following the exciting end of the WNBA and MLB seasons, the energy around sport continues with the NBA, NFL, European Soccer and upcoming college football bowl season where 16 of the top 20 teams and 3 out of the 4 playoff participants are NIKE teams. When these leagues are as exciting as they are today, our business benefits. And NIKE athletes continue to lead the way across the sports landscape, highlighted by Barcelona captain Alexia Putellas, who won the Ballon d\u2019Or as the Best Female Footballer in 2021. We were also thrilled to see Marcus Rashford receive his MBE from Prince William last month, an honor very well deserved for his work to support vulnerable children during the pandemic. And congratulations to Cristiano Ronaldo for reaching yet another remarkable milestone by becoming the first player in recorded history to score 800 career goals in official matches. And I also have to give a special shout out to Shalane Flanagan, who was wearing the Nike Air Zoom Alphafly Next% when she completed the 6 World Marathon Majors in 6 weeks, running each of them in under 2 hours and 47 minutes. This achievement offers all of us a reminder of the joy and unrelenting spirit of sport. As we deliver against our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, we continue to drive separation as the most innovative sports brand by delivering a constant pipeline of new products that set the standard. And what\u2019s more, we\u2019re aligning against our key growth drivers of women\u2019s, Jordan, apparel as well as our commitments to sustainability. In women\u2019s, we launched a brand-new shoe designed specifically for dancers. The Nike Air Sesh was designed by Tinker Hatfield in collaboration with professional dancers and choreographers, and it prioritizes both style and performance with a mid-cut leather upper and cushioned foam under the foot. We launched the Air Sesh for NIKE members first with a wider release to take place soon. And this new product comes as we welcome some of the world\u2019s best athletes to our global roster, including dance choreographer Parris Goebel and fitness athlete, Tunde Oyeneyin. As we continue to accelerate our strategy and fuel the expanded definition of sport, we\u2019re able to more deeply connect with women and create an even sharper focus. And this quarter also saw the debut collection from the Serena Williams Design Crew, our apprenticeship program that advances diversity and design. The Crew connects innovation, design and purpose in a uniquely powerful way, fueled by our commitment to the full spectrum of sport for women across performance and lifestyle. Serena joined us on campus a few months back to help open the Serena Williams building at our world headquarters. Along with our LeBron James Innovation Center, these two buildings represent the most remarkable investment in sport innovation in the world. We were also thrilled to see the Jordan brand launch the AJ 36. The AJ 36 is NIKE, Inc.\u2019s first shoe using leno-weave, a process that creates material that is uniquely strong, lightweight and adaptable to all foot shapes, making the AJ 36 one of the lightest Air Jordans ever. Consumers can expect to see us iterate on this innovation in future seasons. And in apparel, we\u2019re driving energy in the market through design that resonates with consumers. The latest NBA City Edition and MLB City Connect uniforms are great examples as we grow the culture of sport by listening to local team communities and using thoughtful design to celebrate the game. We also launched FIT ADV, the next generation of performance apparel that combines weather-ready tech, an innovative design to help athletes take on extreme conditions. This represents the pinnacle of NIKE apparel innovation and is currently in NIKE\u2019s performance apparel collections. And next year, it will be available in NIKE lifestyle products across all platforms. And finally, in sustainability, we launched Alphafly Next Nature, our most sustainable performance shoe and our first sustainable performance running shoe. This continues the progress made by our Cosmic Unity sustainable basketball shoe by reaching more than 50% total recycled content by weight. Learnings from the Alphafly Next Nature will be scaled across our running line, creating higher performing products with more sustainable materials. We know the future of sport depends on a healthy planet and we remain committed to doing our part to protect that future. As we connect consumers with the strongest innovation, athlete roster and brand storytelling in the world, we\u2019re also elevating their experience through one NIKE marketplace. We\u2019re creating the marketplace of the future where we serve consumers with seamless, consistent and premium experiences. Through NIKE membership, we increasingly know and serve our consumer across a connected marketplace. I\u2019d like to highlight three examples from the quarter of how NIKE is driving a more elevated and premium member experience across the marketplace. First, we recently launched new wellness content and workouts featuring Megan Thee Stallion in our Nike Training Club app. Megan\u2019s content drove record high engagement drawing 2 times increase in daily active users in NTC, and her curated looks saw more than double the demand compared to any other product content viewed during that same time period. Second, ahead of Singles\u2019 Day in Greater China, we activated a new member experience on Tmall and improved the onboarding journey. As a result, the Nike flagship store on Tmall was the number 1 brand for new member recruitment across sport, driving a 20-point increase in member demand penetration this year. And third, just last month, we announced a partnership with one of our strategic retail partners, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, who shares our vision for the future of retail, specifically shopping and experiences that are amplified by digital and personal to each consumer\u2019s journey. This new partnership allows shoppers to link their NIKE member account and their DSG account together to unlock exclusive offers, products and experiences. Recently, I had an opportunity to visit one of DSG\u2019s newest concepts, the House of Sport Door in Rochester, New York. I must say, I was blown away at the store\u2019s unique service model, interactive sport experience and enhanced showcasing of product, which creates a true destination for consumers and will alter future expectations at retail. Our partnership with DSG is a new model of how brands and retailers work together, delivering product experience and connection service to delight consumers at scale. We\u2019re fulfilling our vision that through connected member experiences and inventory, powered by connected data and technology, we can provide consumers with greater access to the very best of NIKE with more speed, convenience and connection to our brand and to sport than ever before. And as we look forward, there is even more opportunity to connect consumers with NIKE across digital platforms that integrate sport, innovation, culture and commerce. For example, we recently opened a new space in our New York digital studio to produce the weekly SNKRS live streams that are driving industry-leading engagement metrics. Weekly content includes launch previews in our Sneakers Live heating up show and a new Jordan franchise presented through the lens of female Jordan fans called Jaywalking. Our stories go deep and engage a two-way interaction with the community. And as a result, our consumer engagement is 3 times the industry average for live streams. And speaking of SNKRS and Jordan, the first set of invitations for the AJ 11 Cool Grey was sent to the largest female focused group yet and sold out in the first hour. The group was selected utilizing our new dedication score designed to reward member groups with high product affinity. We continue to see exclusive access serve as a defining marketing mechanism to connect with consumers. And in Q2, we also launched the 3D immersive world of NIKELAND on Roblox. NIKE is meeting young athletes wherever they are, encouraging to let their imaginations run wild and rewarding real-world movement through new virtual experiences. And just last week, we welcomed RTFKT to the NIKE, Inc. family. The NIKE, Jordan and Converse brands have always thrived at the intersection of sport, creativity, innovation and culture. The RTFKT acquisition allows us to extend this reach to serve and delight consumers and creators in both the physical and virtual worlds. We\u2019ll invest in a very talented RTFKT RTFKT team, creator community and cutting-edge innovation to deliver next-generation experiences that involve the RTFKT and NIKE, Inc. brands. Today, we\u2019re stronger than we were before the pandemic, and I couldn\u2019t be more excited by the opportunity ahead of us. Our results this quarter are evidence that our strategy is working. And as we close out 2021, I want to take a moment to personally thank our 75,000 global NIKE, Inc. teammates for everything they\u2019ve done this year. Through all we\u2019ve navigated, this team has worked together with creativity and resilience to serve our consumers and serve our communities. This team is the greatest collection of talent in the world, and I want to sincerely thank them. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Matt. Matt Friend : Thank you, John. Hello and happy holidays to everyone on the call. As you\u2019ve heard us say before, NIKE is a growth company with boundless potential. And our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy is transforming our operating model by driving deeper and more direct connections with consumers through digital. Our teams continue to navigate through unprecedented levels of volatility, with flexibility, agility and grace, leveraging the operational playbook we created at the onset of the pandemic to stay focused on what matters most. We have embraced new ways of working, elevated experienced players into new leadership roles, reorganized the Company to create even deeper focus on the consumer and developed new capabilities to serve consumers directly with speed and at scale. NIKE\u2019s second quarter financial results were in line with the expectations we established 90 days ago, fueled by continued brand momentum, the strength of our product franchises with extraordinary levels of full-price realization and strong season-to-date holiday sales, offset by lower levels of available inventory supply relative to marketplace demand. As John mentioned, we had an incredible Black Friday week, with NIKE Direct in North America and EMEA, increasing over 20% versus the prior year on top of last year\u2019s meaningful gains. To accomplish this, I\u2019m particularly proud of the work by our supply chain teams. In late October, I was able to visit our North America distribution centers in Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Mississippi, to review our expanding digital fulfillment capabilities and holiday readiness plans. Our teams are executing those plans with precision, optimizing available inventory to meet demand with improved service levels and lowering carbon impact, all enabled through technology and automation. Staying on the topic of supply chain a little longer, factory reopening in Vietnam is on plan. Nearly all impacted factories began reopening in October. As of today, all factories are operational, and employee attendance rates have improved with weekly footwear and apparel production now at roughly 80% of pre-closure volumes. In total, Vietnam factory closures caused us to cancel production of roughly 130 million units due to three months of lost production volume and several months to ramp back to full production. Compared to 90 days ago, we are increasingly confident supply will normalize heading into fiscal \u201823. Turning to our digital business. NIKE\u2019s digital growth is outperforming comparisons and being fueled by our member-centric focus. NIKE Digital grew 11% in the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, setting the pace for the industry. NIKE Digital is now 25% of total NIKE brand revenue, up 3 points versus the prior year and more than double the digital mix in fiscal \u201819. Enhanced onboarding experiences are attracting millions of new members into the top of the funnel, and we are focused heavily on member engagement and buying. Member engagement grew 27% and repeat buyers grew 50% versus last year, driving overall higher AUR, AOV and member buying frequency. 40% of total digital demand this year is coming from our mobile apps, highlighting the strength of our digital platform. We now have over 79 million engaged members across our NIKE ecosystem. And as NIKE\u2019s digital ecosystem continues to grow, we are beginning to see the compounding benefits of scale from brand awareness and consumer connection to data-informed personalization and inventory utilization to loyalty. This quarter, we held our first globally coordinated Member Days event, setting records in member engagement. From member-exclusive product offerings to our first live stream member events from our NikeTown London and Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia store in Barcelona, we created a distinct member experience and set a record for weekly active users on the Nike app in North America. Now, moving to one final topic. Connecting with today\u2019s consumers means serving them with the product they want, when and where they want it. Consumers want a premium, seamless and personalized experience with minimal friction across their journey to explore, engage, connect and purchase products from the brands they love. As we\u2019ve discussed before, NIKE is focused on creating one NIKE marketplace that elevates the brand by creating direct consumer connections through fewer, more impactful wholesale partners with a connected mobile digital experience at the center built for the NIKE member. Over the past 4 years, North America has reduced the number of wholesale accounts by roughly 50%, while delivering strong growth and recapturing consumer demand through NIKE Direct and our strategic wholesale partners, leading the way for NIKE. In the second quarter, North America Digital grew 40% versus the prior year, pushing NIKE Digital to 30% of total North America marketplace, bringing NIKE Direct to 48% of total. In order to enable this growth and drive the shift in marketplace composition, we have accelerated investment to evolve our distribution network and scale a digital-first supply chain, leveraging advanced analytics, automation and technology. We have opened two new regional service centers on both coasts, which are able to deliver more units to consumers with shorter delivery times. We also enabled ship-from-store capabilities across our store fleet, all leveraging advanced analytics from our Celect acquisition. On automation, we\u2019ve added more than 1,000 robots in our distribution centers to handle the digital growth. In our digital distribution center in Memphis, robots handled more than 10 million units that would have otherwise required manual labor. We continue to scale O2O consumer services across our store fleet, including buy online, pick up in store and digital order returns in store. Volumes are relatively small today, but we have significant opportunity to scale. We\u2019ve also established new fulfillment models with key strategic partners to create inventory visibility across the marketplace and optimize full-price digital demand. When we do this right, the consumer wins. The progress being made to create One Nike Marketplace has accelerated North America\u2019s revenue growth and gross margin expansion for yet another quarter, illustrating how consumer-direct acceleration will fuel NIKE\u2019s growth and profitability towards the fiscal \u201825 outlook we shared in June. Now, let me turn to the details of our second quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 1% and was flat on a currency-neutral basis, led by 8% growth in NIKE Direct offset by a 6% decline in wholesale due to optimization of available inventory supply. NIKE Digital grew 11% and NIKE-owned stores grew 4% with significant improvements in traffic and higher conversion rates. Gross margin increased 280 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by higher NIKE Direct margins due to lower markdowns, higher full price mix and foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by increased freight and logistics costs. SG&A grew 15% versus the prior year, primarily due to normalization of spend against brand campaigns, digital marketing investments to support heightened digital demand, strategic technology investments and wage-related expenses. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.9% compared to 14.1% for the same period last year. This was due to a shift in our earnings mix and the effects of stock-based compensation. Second quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.83, up 6% versus the prior year. Before we move into operating segment results, I want to recall a few points I made last quarter regarding the impact of Vietnam factory closures on the short-term performance of each of our geographies beginning in the second quarter. North America and EMEA finished the first quarter with high levels of in-transit inventory, resulting in prior season supply that was arriving late due to longer transit times, which could be sold in the second quarter. We saw that in our Q2 results. However, Greater China and APLA, located closer to our sourcing base with shorter standard transit times, experienced a decline in units sold in the second quarter due to lost production and lower available inventory supply. We also saw that reflected in our Q2 results. With that in mind, let\u2019s review the operating segments. In North America, Q2 revenue grew 12% and EBIT grew 21%. Demand for NIKE remained incredibly strong with season-to-date holiday retail sales across the total market growing double digits, energized by the continued momentum from the return to sport and the beginning of an outstanding holiday season. Performance sport dimensions delivered strong double-digit retail sales growth led by running, fitness and basketball on lower levels of sell-in due to available inventory supply. Women\u2019s retail sales grew high double digits, more than twice the rate of men\u2019s with strong growth across both footwear and apparel. NIKE Direct had an outstanding quarter, growing 30% versus the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, digital maintained its momentum growing 40% and setting holiday records on Black Friday week. NIKE-owned stores also delivered strong double-digit growth, with traffic trending towards pre-pandemic levels and strong increases in AUR due to lower closeout inventory levels and significant year-over-year improvements in markdown rates and promotions. Despite strong retail sales momentum in the wholesale channel, revenue declined 1% as marketplace inventory levels remain lean and Vietnam factory closures and longer transit times disrupt the flow of inventory supply to meet marketplace demand. In EMEA, Q2 revenue grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT grew 22% on a reported basis. Season-to-date holiday retail sales across the total market grew double digits, with strong growth across all consumer segments. The region was energized by the start of the global football season and the Champions League tournament across the continent. NIKE players continue to dominate on the pitch with the Mercurial boot being the lead score in a number of European professional leagues. We saw a strong consumer response for the Mercurial boot and launch of the Champions League third kit. Wholesale revenue grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis as we comp prior year market closures. NIKE Direct also grew 6%, led by double-digit growth in NIKE-owned stores, as we comp prior year store closures with traffic improvement due to tourism picking up and back-to-school holidays. NIKE Digital was down 1% as we compare to extraordinary levels of off-price sales in the prior year as the geography leverage digital in the prior year to liquidate excess inventory. This quarter, our full-price digital business grew over 20% resulting in a 30-point improvement in full price sales mix, double-digit growth in AUR and improvement in markdown rates and promotions. This contributed to strong year-over-year expansion in gross margin and return on sales profitability. In Greater China, Q2 revenue declined 24% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT declined 36% on a reported basis. However, season-to-date holiday retail sales across the total market have trended more favorably. Results for this quarter were as expected, as we navigated lower full-price product supply, due to the Vietnam factory closures. We saw disproportionate impacts to our wholesale revenue, which declined 27% on a currency-neutral basis. NIKE Direct declined 21% with declines in both, digital and physical retail channels. COVID-related lockdowns continue to drive volatility in retail traffic. However, we did see traffic recover to pre-pandemic levels at times throughout the quarter. Digital declined 27%, partially impacted by delay in product launch timing on SNKRS. Over the 11/11 consumer moment, we drove stronger digital performance with significant member acquisition and higher AOV through better engagement with consumers. While challenging, we continue to leverage our operational playbook and remain optimistic about the longer term in Greater China. This quarter, we extended our Joy of Sports brand campaign, utilizing local influencers, Olympians and other athletes that are part of NIKE\u2019s leading sports marketing portfolio in Greater China. The Jordan brand added to the energy by announcing their first female athlete signing in Asia with basketball player Yang Shuyu. To support this activity and normalize our marketing investment levels, we increased our investment in demand-creation in the second quarter by more than 40% versus the prior year. Our local team remains focused on creating distinctive and authentic connections with Chinese consumers. We celebrated the 40th anniversary of NIKE\u2019s operations in China by using the Express Lane to reintroduce the original NIKE collection with robust storytelling on the history and heritage of these iconic products. During our first launch, all products sold through in the first hour. We will continue to expand the Express Lane to bring unique localized offerings to the consumer, leveraging our most popular global product franchises to drive uniquely NIKE energy in the marketplace. We see encouraging signs in Greater China. And while inventory supply has been a major disruption in the marketplace, we continue to expect fiscal \u201822 to be a year of recovery. Having said that, we expect to see sequential improvement from here, beginning in the third quarter. Now, moving to APLA. Q2 revenue declined 6% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT declined 8% on a reported basis. Double-digit revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis in SOCO was offset by declines in Asia Pacific territories, which faced a greater impact from Vietnam factory closures as well as the business model shift in Brazil. Season-to-date holiday retail sales across the total market grew versus the prior year, despite supply disruptions and door closures in SEA&I and Pacific. NIKE Direct grew 6%, led by NIKE Digital growth of 25%. Our teams maximized market moments with all territories delivering successful member days and locally relevant activations, including Singles\u2019 Day in Southeast Asia, Buen Fin in Mexico and Cyber Week in Japan. Mexico\u2019s digital business more than doubled as we enabled the localized assortment and fulfillment capabilities through the NIKE App. Finally, APLA continues to leverage the Express Lane, their digital ecosystem and global partnerships to create locally relevant product and meaningful engagement with consumers around the world. Consumers in APLA are highly connected, and our team continues to innovate on digital experiences that are locally relevant. The Dia de los Muertos footwear pack saw a 100% sell-through, and this story was extended to the world through our new partnership with Roblox. Now, let\u2019s turn to our financial outlook. As we approach the end of the second year of the pandemic, it is becoming even more challenging to compare quarters and fiscal years due to multiple waves of COVID-related disruption at different times across the consumer marketplace and now supply chain. We expect the operating environment to remain volatile as COVID variants continue to cause disruption to business operations. Our fiscal \u201822 financial outlook reflects inventory supply significantly lagging consumer demand across NIKE\u2019s portfolio of brands. However, NIKE\u2019s long-term market opportunity is larger than ever. And so, we remain focused on what we can control in the short term and on where we are heading through our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy and on what is required to deliver on our fiscal \u201825 financial outlook. Specifically for fiscal \u201822, we continue to expect revenue to grow mid-single digits versus the prior year, in line with guidance from 90 days ago. For Q3, we expect revenue to grow low-single digits versus the prior year due to the ongoing impacts from lost production from COVID-related disruptions in Vietnam. We are raising our gross margin guidance to expand 150 basis points versus the prior year. We expect to continue benefiting from exceptional demand against the backdrop of lean marketplace inventory. Full price realization will remain above our long-term target with lower channel markdowns. However, we expect product costs to rise in the second half due to higher macro input costs. We\u2019re also planning for supply chain costs for the full year to increase relative to our estimates 90 days ago with a greater impact in the second half. Last, we now expect foreign exchange to be a 55 basis-point tailwind versus the prior year. We continue to expect SG&A to grow mid to high teens for the full year as demand-creation spend normalizes, and we continue to invest in the capabilities to support our consumer-led digital transformation. We now expect our effective tax rate to be in the low-teens for the full year. Consumer Direct Acceleration is driving our business forward, and it is transforming our financial model. We continue to prove that we can manage through the uncertainty and volatility in the current operating environment. But we are doing more than just managing through. We are building NIKE for the future with deeper consumer connections, a pipeline of product innovation to serve the needs of the modern athlete and new operational capabilities required to serve consumers directly and digitally at scale. We have a clear vision of our brand\u2019s long-term future and so we remain focused on what is required to win over the long term. With that, let\u2019s open up the call for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Kimberly Greenberger : Great. Thank you so much. And a great job here navigating through, I think, a very difficult time. Matt, I wanted to follow up on your commentary regarding the resumption of production running at 80%. Can you just talk about your expectation here over the next several months in terms of that continued productivity ramp? And when do you expect to be -- if you could just talk about, again, I know you talked about it last quarter, but when do you expect to be back in a more offensive position with regard to inventory and fully restocked on that? Thank you. Matt Friend : Sure, Kimberly, and thanks for the question. As I mentioned, our factories are back operational at this point in time, and I referenced an 80% number across footwear and apparel. It actually skews a little lower in footwear and a little higher in apparel. But as we watch employee attendance rates each week, we continue to grow increasingly confident in the guidance that we provided last quarter. So, last quarter, we said our factories would resume production on October 1, and we said it would take us several months to get back to weekly production capacity consistent with where we were prior to the factory closures. We\u2019re on that plan. So, as we look at our guidance for the balance of the year, it reflects those continued assumptions. And relative to where we were 90 days ago, we\u2019re increasingly confident that inventory supply will normalize and that we\u2019ll be in a position to meet the incredible demand that we\u2019re seeing across the marketplace. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Adrienne Yih : Yes. Thank you very much. Also my kudos for navigating a tough landscape. John, I wanted to ask about China. Adidas on their call maybe a month ago, early November, had talked about too much inventory and actually having to redirect. It was very promotional in the China market. So, I was wondering if you can talk about the China competitive landscape, maybe some commentary on both [Indiscernible] the domestic brands versus the western brands, Nike, Adidas, Puma and the like. Thank you very much. John Donahoe : Yes. Thanks, Adrienne. I\u2019m just going to repeat what I said last quarter and the quarter before, which is NIKE always has, and we always will, take a long-term view in China, right? We\u2019ve been there for 40 years. Phil was in there very early. We have built up a very strong brand connection with the consumer in China. And we\u2019re going to continue to invest to lead in China. And so, we\u2019re investing behind the various things that brought us to where we are today. First and foremost, we have a great local team. Angela Dong and her team are helping us navigate and shepherd through the current environment. Product innovations, at the top of our list, the most innovative product in the world that we consistently produce increasingly tailored to the Chinese consumer through our Express Lane. And Matt talked a little bit about that, and that more and more of what we do in China is tailored to that China consumer. Same thing on storytelling. Storytelling that\u2019s centered on local athletes and the local consumer. We mentioned the signing of the most recent Jordan sports marketing [Indiscernible] and the live streaming. We\u2019re connecting with that local Chinese consumer on their terms. And then, we continue to be responsible citizens. We\u2019ve always invested to grow sport in China. We are continuing to do that. We care and are investing behind sustainability. And so, the same fundamentals that have always been there, we believe, are the right fundamentals going forward. This quarter, as Matt said, the results were in line with what we expected, with all the supply shortages and other dimensions. And what I look at is when we are present and active with the consumer in China, how they\u2019re responding. We saw some very encouraging things. We were very active around Singles\u2019 Day, right? We mentioned 90 live streams in the month prior with over 70 million viewers. That led to 13 million new members. And NIKE, once again being number 1 on the Tmall during that period in China. And so, we\u2019re focusing on the long term. We\u2019re getting a little bit better each quarter, and we\u2019re going to continue on that path, working closely with our team there. Matt Friend : I might just add one small thing, which is we restarted brand activity, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. And our demand creation investment was up 40% versus the prior year. And if you look at it on a dollar basis, it\u2019s an even greater percentage versus what we invested in the first quarter. And so, we -- and we\u2019re seeing a favorable consumer response. And we expect those investments to pay dividends as we look towards the future and continue to engage in locally relevant ways with consumers. Adrienne Yih : Great. Matt, how should we shape China in the third quarter relative to the guidance you gave? Matt Friend : We expect, as supply normalizes, to see sequential improvement versus the results that we delivered in the second quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore. Omar Saad : I wanted to see if you guys could maybe touch upon Omicron. I know it\u2019s really still early, but you guys have, as you mentioned, tens of thousands of teammates all around the world. It\u2019s obviously a fast-developing phenomenon. Maybe you could touch upon how you incorporated anything related to Omicron in your guidance? And is it something that we should not only be thinking about from the demand perspective, but is it the kind of situation that could also disrupt the supply chain again in the coming months, or do you feel like it\u2019s fortified to the extent where we can withstand this latest variant? Thanks, guys. John Donahoe : Omar, let me start and maybe talk about our team, and then, Matt, you can maybe elaborate on it. Omar, I just got to say I am so proud of how our team has navigated through the last 6 to 24 months. It\u2019s been an ongoing series, as you know, of start-stop, a lot of uncertainty, a lot of change. And our team has responded with resilience, with creativity, and with a lot of innovation. And I got to be honest, in hindsight, many of the changes that have been made accelerated progress that otherwise would have happened. And so, we\u2019re actually in a stronger position today. I think we\u2019ve actually benefited because of our team\u2019s efforts and demonstrated ability to respond even in a work-from-home environment. Now that said, we do believe over time that with innovation and a strong brand, we want to go to a hybrid model. As you know, in the United States, we have mandated vaccines and have a very high response rate to that. So, we\u2019re ready to come back in a hybrid work environment when that\u2019s safe, and we prioritize that, safety of our employees. And we\u2019ll be ready, whether that\u2019s first quarter or whenever it ends up being. But in the interim, our teams continue to innovate and execute in a way that I\u2019m so appreciative and proud of. And I think the results reflect that. Do you want to talk about the impact, Matt, on the rest of them? Matt Friend : Yes, Omar. I mean, the reality of the environment we\u2019re working right now, we\u2019re all navigating through together. It\u2019s uncertain, it\u2019s volatile. But, what I would say as it relates to our fiscal year guidance, the overwhelming impact that we updated everyone on last quarter was the impact of the supply reductions, the 130 million units and the impact that had on our fiscal year revenue outlook. I think, we\u2019re better positioned than we\u2019ve ever been, and we\u2019re two-plus years into navigating through the challenges and the complexities of the volatility as it relates to the pandemic, focusing on what matters most, and our teams have done a tremendous job doing that. And so, we\u2019re going to continue to watch it closely, like everyone is. But at this point in time, given where consumer demand is relative to marketplace supply, we feel like our forecast is or our guidance is reflective of what we see in the intermediate term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Bob Drbul : I guess, the question I\u2019d like to focus on is like on the product launches, are you delaying -- if you have an issue in terms of the delay. When you have launches planned, are you pushing them out, or how are you prioritizing which ones get canceled versus which ones will just launch later? Matt Friend : Yes, Bob, it\u2019s a great question. To date, we have been delaying launches to synchronize them around the world. And as an example, in Greater China in the second quarter, SNKRS was down 50% versus the prior year, which had a big impact on that digital number. And that was because we didn\u2019t have the available inventory supply across the rest of our geographies to be able to coordinate a launch. We\u2019re evaluating that as we look forward because we want to do the right thing for the consumer in the right local marketplaces. But yes, we have been operating that way to date. John Donahoe : But, I got to just build on that and say while the launch is being delayed, our investment in innovation and commitment innovation has not been deteriorated or delayed at all. Matt and I were both we were over at innovation review in the LeBron James building, what was it, a couple of weeks ago, where Tom Clarke, John Hoke and their teams, Mike Splane, were going through remarkable pipeline of innovation. And again -- and innovation around platforms, around the NEXT% platform, around the FlyEase platform, around the Zoom platform. And so, the innovation pipeline we have coming in the coming months and years is very strong, and the commitment to innovation and the day in, day out relentless focus on a culture of innovation continues unabated. Again, to my prior answer, I just am so impressed with what our innovators, our designers, our product creators, our brand and storytellers have been able to do, even through this challenging circumstance. Matt Friend : And our teams are shifting to a seasonless approach as we navigate the inventory we have for the balance of the year in order to make sure that we can fulfill consumer demand with the supply we have versus delaying further. Bob Drbul : Got it. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up. I guess, on the RTFKT acquisition, is a Trussell coin in the offing? John Donahoe : I don\u2019t think that\u2019s probably first on the priority list. But I don\u2019t know, Paul, maybe. Paul Trussell : It could be up there. John Donahoe : Maybe. Maybe someday, you can come to us from the metaverse, Paul. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Laurent Vasilescu with BNP. Laurent Vasilescu : I wanted to ask about pricing, especially with the backdrop of the very strong gross margin. Near term, how should we think about the promotional environment in North America and EMEA for the back half of the fiscal year? And then, longer term, on the last call, you talked about exceeding your 65% full-price sales realization goal put forward in your last Investor Day, just curious to know what that new goal is embedded with the 2025 targets? Matt Friend : Sure, Laurent. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the biggest drivers of gross margin expansion this quarter, and frankly, the biggest driver relative to what we had guided 90 days ago was the level of full price realization and lower markdown rates versus what we had anticipated for a holiday season. And so, we were surprised by it. And it just is reflective of the strength of the brand and the connections that we\u2019ve got with consumers. As we look to the balance of the year, we are expecting full-price realization to stay high and above, especially in North America and EMEA, that goal that we provided at Investor Day a couple of years ago, and we expect discount rates to remain low. The impact, as you look at sequential quarters is that we started to see improvements in markdown rates in the second half of last year in those two geographies in particular. And so, the year-over-year impact from tighter supply, higher full price realization, lower markdowns has a lesser of an impact in the second quarter. What I\u2019d say longer term is we continue to evaluate full-price realization and the goals that we\u2019ve set. And while we haven\u2019t changed them, we are above in a couple of markets. As inventory supply normalizes, we would expect that to come back down to where our goals are at, but we\u2019re also operating a far more agile operating model at this point in time and so -- led by NIKE Direct. And so, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate it especially as it pertains to the long-term margin outlook we provided. We still are confident in that high 40s gross margin outlook through fiscal \u201825. But I think the effects that we\u2019re seeing in this first year with tightened supply may just change the trajectory of how we get there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Matthew Boss : So John, you cited the NIKE brand in a much stronger competitive position today relative to 18 months ago. I guess, maybe help us to think about that statement on a global basis, if we think about the acceleration you\u2019re seeing in North America, maybe relative to underlying trends in Europe and Greater China, just as we think about that statement in terms of where we stand today relative to 18 months ago. John Donahoe : Sure, Matt. Let me just tell you the foundation with which I say it. Number one, our brand tracking tells us that our brand is still the number 1 cool and favorite brand in all 12 of our key cities around the world, and it\u2019s strengthening, and strengthening against our historical competitors. In fact, the only people that are coming close are technology companies. And so, that continues to be one evidence. But I think even more fundamentally in longer term is the foundation of having a direct connection with the consumer. We are in an era where that is the liquid gold for any brand is to have a direct connection with the consumer so that you can understand that consumer, you can engage that consumer and then you can serve them in a personalized way. And if you have a leadership position, you have more information with which to do all that, more data, more information. And so, our digital penetration is at an all-time high. Matt mentioned it\u2019s 25%. Our Direct Digital and mono brand penetration is at an all-time high that gives us that direct connection. And frankly, the partnerships like DICK\u2019S allows us to have that direct connection, whether it\u2019s direct, or with a wholesale partner, and that allows us to serve that consumer in a more personalized, engaging and sustainable way. And we believe that is going to be one of the key indicators of future success. And not every brand in our industry or other industries is to be able to have that direct connection with consumers. And so, that\u2019s the best leading indicator. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re putting so much focus on our full consumer funnel, bringing new members into the top of the funnel, engaging the mid-funnel and then obviously, translating that into strong and deep relationships. And so, when you compare geographies, we\u2019re in this weird period where you got sort of numerator-denominator issues, right? Obviously, North America results were really strong this quarter. We had the supply and our team did a great job executing. In EMEA, for instance, the digital results reflected last year when we were sort of liquidating a lot of inventory when COVID just occurred. But, I look at our full-price digital penetration, it was quite strong. So, the quarter-to-quarter growth rates get a little bit hard to interpret because of supply issues because of the previous years, we\u2019re lapping store closures or -- but I would say we feel very good and very confident about being stronger in each of our regions. Matt Friend : And in this fiscal year, we accelerated our investment against the brand to solidify that number 1 position and to continue to have deep connections with consumers. And despite the supply reduction, we remain committed to normalizing that investment because we\u2019re focused on fiscal \u201825 and beyond and the opportunity that we see in front of us across the entire portfolio. And we\u2019re leveraging our financial strength and our balance sheet to enable us to stay focused on the long term. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : Hey guys. Thanks for all the detail here and for taking our questions, and nice job executing in a pretty tough quarter there. Matt, let me start with the comment, your improved confidence on the supply chain versus 90 days ago, confidence in inventory getting back to more normal flows in fiscal \u201823. Is that what it takes for the China market to get back to the kind of the long-term algorithm with sustained double-digit growth that you spoke about on the fourth quarter call? Matt Friend : Thanks for the question, Michael. The results this quarter in China were absolutely -- were overwhelmingly impacted by supply disruptions from Vietnam. And we\u2019ve been -- we\u2019ve talked about that both earlier today and last quarter. We also had to navigate through local measures that were put in place to reduce the spread of COVID. And what I mean by that is that 25% of our partner retail stores were impacted in the quarter in some way as a result of local mandates to affect operations, and 50% of our factory stores in Greater China were equal -- were similarly impacted. And so, that was -- those were clearly the two biggest drivers that impacted our performance this quarter. I mentioned SNKRS and the comparison challenges due to the delay of launch. But we\u2019ve actually seen digital sequentially improving throughout the quarter. And so, we\u2019re increasingly optimistic given our 11/11 performance in the way that we\u2019re sequentially improving. And as supply normalizes, as I referenced, we expect to see sequential improvement from these 2Q results. And as we restart our marketing activity and drive those connections with consumers, some of these signals that we\u2019re seeing, these encouraging signs that we see give us a lot of confidence that our trajectory is going to improve from this quarter. Operator : And I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Paul for any closing remarks. Paul Trussell : Well, thank you, everyone, for joining the day. We look forward to speaking to you not just next quarter, but next year. So, happy holidays to all. Take care and stay safe. John Donahoe : Happy holidays, everyone. Matt Friend : Happy holidays. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to NIKE, Inc.'s Fiscal 2022 Third Quarter Fiscal Conference Call. For those who want to reference today's press release, you'll find it at http ://investors.nike.com. Leading today's call is Paul Trussell, VP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Trussell, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including the annual report filed on Form 10-K. Some forward-looking statements may concern expectations of future revenue growth and gross margin. In addition, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to constant dollar revenue. References to constant dollar revenue are intended to provide context as to the performance of the business eliminating foreign exchange fluctuations. Participants may also reference to other non-public financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures. To the extent non-public financial and statistical information is discussed, presentations of comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations will be made available at NIKE's website, http://investors.nike.com.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Paul Trussell. Paul Trussell : Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal 2022 third quarter results. As the operator indicated, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about 45 minutes ago, or at our website, investors.nike.com. Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe; and our Chief Financial Officer, Matt Friend. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial question to one. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe. John Donahoe : Thanks, Paul, and hello to everyone on today's call. I first want to acknowledge the deeply troubling crisis still unfolding in Ukraine. It's a time of great concern for all of us, and it is simply devastating to see the impact it's having on the lives of so many people. As always, our primary focus is the safety and well-being of our teammates and their communities, and we remain hopeful for a peaceful resolution soon. Now turning to our Q3 performance. More than 2 years since the start of the pandemic, our teams continue to prove their ability to operate through volatility while also staying focused on the long term. And we once again demonstrated that agility in Q3. It's clear that our strategy is working, with business results that reflect our deep connection to consumers around the world. Thanks to our brand momentum, culture of innovation and proven operational playbook, we stay in the lead and continue to drive further competitive separation. I'm proud of our results this quarter. We met and even exceeded what we said we would deliver 90 days ago. For Q3, our revenue growth was 5%, led by double-digit growth in NIKE Direct. This success, amidst the dynamic macroeconomic environment, is what continues to give us confidence in our long-term outlook and it's why I would not trade our position with anyone. The power of NIKE is our consistency and the strength of our global portfolio. Our investments are making us stronger and we're excited by what we see as we execute against our growth opportunities. As a team, we're driven by our shared purpose to move the world forward through the power of sport. And earlier this month, we released our fiscal '21 Impact Report. This report, which marks our 20th year reporting on our environmental and social impact is our first since we set new quantifiable ESG targets last year. We're focused on a wide range of priorities from building a diverse, inclusive team and culture, to meeting the challenges of climate change, to helping kids access the joy of play and movements. I encourage all of you to learn more about the measurable progress we've made at purpose.nike.com as we continue to create long-term value by shaping a better future through sport. And of course, 2022 isn't just an anniversary for our Impact Report, it's also a big year for NIKE itself. This May, NIKE will be celebrating our 50th anniversary as a company. 50 years ago, our journey began with a dream to serve athletes, and today, we're humbled by what we've achieved and we're thrilled and excited by what's to come. Looking at Q3, NIKE's growth was and it will continue to be the result of 3 areas I'll touch on today : first, connecting with consumers through our strong portfolio of brands; second, driving a relentless flow of new product innovation; and third, expanding our digital advantage to create the marketplace of the future. So let's start with NIKE's strong brand and our connection to sport, which differentiates us all over the world. NIKE's connections with consumers are driven by sport and cultural authenticity. And our roster of athletes is second to none. Rafael Nadal made history by becoming the first male tennis player to win 21 majors with his victory at the Australian Open, and he now stands alone at the top of the men's game. Aaron Donald, Cooper Kupp and Odell Beckham Jr. led the L.A. Rams to a thrilling Super Bowl victory. And in the NBA All-Star game, a face-off between Team LeBron and Team KD ended with LeBron hitting the game winner. I was able to attend the game and I loved getting to see the league showcase of its 75th anniversary team. It was just an awesome reminder of the power of sport and what sport has meant to so many of us over the years. The quarter also saw the Winter Olympics and Paralympics produce some extraordinary athletic performances. Nathan Chen won gold for the U.S. in the men's singles figure skating. And Chloe Kim won gold in the U.S. in the half-pipe, making her the first woman to win 2 gold medals in the event. And throughout the Olympics, our Never Done brand campaign was awesome. In Greater China, it featured snowboarder Cai Xuetong, and it saw an incredible response in that geo with over 6.1 billion impressions. And we're also in the middle of an amazing March Madness with NIKE, Inc. having more teams still alive across the men's and women's brackets than all other brands combined. But there's 1 familiar face to the Sweet 16 I want to acknowledge. As you know, Mike Krzyzewski is coaching in his final season at Duke, having already announced his retirement as the winningest coach in NCAA men's basketball history. Coach K has been a member of the NIKE family for nearly 30 years, and his leadership and clear set of values have meant so much to this company and to me personally. My leadership role models have always been head coaches, leaders that serve their players, serve their programs and serve a broader cause, and Coach K has been right up there at the top of that list. So from the entire NIKE family, happy retirement, coach. This was also a quarter where the world was reminded of how the NIKE Brand drives the culture around sport. In January, Sotheby's auctioned off 200 pairs of the Louis Vuitton Air Force 1 by Virgil Abloh and reported that it set the record for the most valuable sneaker and fashion auction ever at more than $25 million, with all proceeds going to Virgil Abloh's Post-Modern Scholarship Fund. The auction drew the most bidders of any auction in Sotheby's history and was their most valuable charity auction over the past decade. It's simply another reminder of how the NIKE Brand, our most iconic product franchises and our partnerships, can come together for the kind of power and cultural energy and excitement that only NIKE can create. In fact, that power was also felt in one of the biggest stages of the quarter. During the halftime show of the Super Bowl, in front of the largest U.S. TV audience of the last 5 years, we saw NIKE Jordan and Converse footwear all on stage during the performance, which was simply an incredible moment for our portfolio of brands. Our portfolio is one of our best competitive advantages, fueling energy to consumers worldwide. And we also connect that energy to consumers through the investments we make. Driven by our commitment to women's sport, this quarter, we furthered our 25-year commitment to the WNBA by becoming an equity investor in the league. We'll work together to deepen WNBA's storytelling and bring more girls into basketball at the local level. The consumer response to our long-standing commitment has been clear. This season, we sold more WNBA jerseys on nike.com on launch day alone than we did over the entire previous year. And this is just simply the latest example of how driving the sport of basketball to a new generation of fans connects us to a vast market with plenty of growth ahead. As you know, at NIKE, everything starts with innovation. And our relentless pipeline of innovative product continues to create separation between us and our competition. And we don't just create new franchises, we grow them to global scale. Take a look at FlyEase. We've talked before about our hands-free accessibility line, and we're excited by our work to scale this innovation across our entire portfolio. Here's just 3 examples from Q3. As part of the Medal Stand look for the Team USA\u2019s Olympians and Paralympians, we designed the ACG Gaiadome FlyEase Boot, FlyEase's first crossover into our celebrated outdoor ACG line. And FlyEase also moved into Converse for the first time with the Chuck Taylor All Star CX FlyEase, as Converse now joins NIKE and Jordan in adding the hands-free innovation to footwear icons. And in kids, where helping make spontaneous play easy is one of our goals, the new Dynamo GO uses FlyEase to help kids quickly get their shoes on and off. Dynamo GO debuted in Japan, Korea and Greater China to become one of the season's top 5 sellers, and we have a North America launch scheduled for April. By driving impact across platforms, our work to scale FlyEase catalyzes growth. We expect FlyEase to be roughly $0.25 billion business by fiscal next year, with vast opportunity for even greater growth and value to come. Looking at performance innovation. In Q3, we launched the ZoomX Streakfly, our lightest road racing shoe yet. The Streakfly offers an engineered knit upper and responsive ZoomX midsole, all designed for speed in the middle distances. Also in running, the Pegasus 38 saw very strong sell-through in the quarter, continuing the Peg's lineage as one of our powerhouse franchises. And we're also always innovating in apparel. I mentioned the Olympics earlier. The hockey jersey worn by our federations, including the U.S. and Canada, were designed using brand-new 4D body mapping technology from our NIKE Sports Research Lab. This 4D body mapping, which gives our teams a fast, accurate and high detailed way to design, offers a hint of the future as we stay focused on bringing new technology into our growth opportunity in apparel. And last but not least, we continue to set the standard for sustainable product creation. A few weeks ago, we announced the NIKE ISPA Link, a new proprietary platform where shoes are built with interlocking modules and they're connected without any glue. From a manufacturing standpoint, ISPA Link is revolutionary in its simplicity. One pair takes about 8 minutes to assemble, a fraction of the time needed for a traditional sneaker. And it doesn't require energy-intensive processes like heating, cooling and conveyor belt systems. So with no sacrifice to comfort or stability, the ISPA Link will be available at retail in June and we can't wait for consumers to give it a try. Now let's move to the marketplace as we align our business to build deeper and more meaningful relationships with consumers. Our marketplace strategy is a growth strategy, and it's driven by the consumer, fueled by their expectations of a consistent, seamless and premium shopping experience. Our approach begins with the understanding that consumers expect us to know who they are regardless of channel, online or offline, across the full array of mono-brand stores, NIKE Digital and our wholesale partners. Our wholesale partners continue to play a very important role in our marketplace strategy, so let me start there. Last quarter, we announced a new partnership model that makes real our vision to give consumers personalized experiences regardless of channel. It gives shoppers the benefits of NIKE membership to unlock exclusive offers, products and experiences in partner stores. And it also recognizes the importance of onboarding members in stores, which in turn accelerates in-store conversion and improve customer lifetime value. This quarter, we extended this model globally, including 2 new connected partners in Greater China, Topsports, Pou Sheng. This is an exciting step on our journey within our marketplace strategy because it continues to prove how powerful it is when brands and retailers work together for the benefit of consumers. We value the strong strategic relationships we have with our partners, particularly through our shared vision of connected data and inventory. And this approach lets us serve consumers with the greatest access to the best of NIKE and to do so with speed and convenience in a more personalized, engaging and sustainable way. And what's more, in Greater China, this partnership model takes us into a new era of marketplace transformation. Moving forward, all of our existing contracts with our NSP partners in the geo will follow this connected membership model. And over time, we plan to convert all partner mono-brand stores into digitally connected NIKE retail concepts as we unlock the benefits of data and inventory across the Greater China marketplace. We're excited by the promise of this new model, and we strongly believe it will elevate the entire marketplace and drive growth for both NIKE and our partners over the long term. Next, let's dig a little deeper into our growing digital advantage. As we create the future of retail, we build on our own digital capabilities that connect and serve consumers at scale. In Q3, digital revenue was up 22% on a currency-neutral basis as we continue to drive greater competitive separation, particularly through our app ecosystem. The NIKE mobile app was up more than 50% in the quarter and overtook Nike.com on mobile for our highest share of digital demand. And sneakers continues to gain momentum, particularly as its strong consumer engagement leads to improved conversion. The live streaming on sneakers remains incredibly popular with new features continuously coming online. For instance, we started to drop product launches within live streams, which helps lead our audience to quadruple since our live streaming began last fiscal year. And in December, the AJ11 Cool Grey launch on SNKRS was the largest for a single style in the history of NIKE Direct. We drove this unprecedented demand by engaging with consumers in new ways, including leveraging Snapchat's Try On lens, a #InMyJs Instagram activation and a Fortnite partnership with custom skins and a digital scavenger hunt. Looking forward, we're excited about the opportunity for SNKRS to continue to explore new dimensions and experiences like live streaming and to do so particularly for women's product and for apparel. More to come here soon as we continue to use digital to engage all consumers in ways that integrate culture, commerce, sport and innovation. And at the same time, our growing participation in new digital platforms lets us create innovative ways to connect with consumers, letting them unlock virtual experiences, products and rewards as we expand access points to NIKE across the digital ecosystem. For instance, to celebrate the Super Bowl, we collaborated with EA Sports, giving NIKE members who ran 5 miles in our Nike Run Club rewards and unlocks within the Madden game. Members had to link accounts between NIKE and EA to join the challenge, representing the first incidence of account linking with our gaming partners. The number of new members we acquired surpassed our expectations. And the framework we developed with EA Sports will allow future membership connects to come to life even more efficiently with new partners. And we expect that this, in turn, will lead to increased engagement, membership and revenue growth down the line. And during NBA All-Star Week, LeBron visited NIKELAND on Roblox to inspire its community towards physical movement in play. On the NIKELAND court, LeBron coached and engaged with players, and participants were rewarded for physical gameplay with the ability to unlock virtual products. Since its launch, a total of 6.7 million players from 224 countries have visited NIKELAND on Roblox. And we plan to continue driving energy there with virtual products like LeBron 19 styles special to Roblox. In addition, we announced NIKE Virtual Studios this quarter, following our acquisition of RTFKT. With NIKE Virtual Studios, our vision is to take our best-in-class experiences in digital and build Web 3 products and experiences to scale this community so that NIKE and our members can create, share and benefit together. In Q3, RTFKT released the first official NIKE-branded NFT, our first step into the world of digital product creation. We're pleased by the positive momentum and energy we're already seeing in the space, and we're excited by the future as we continue to extend our digital leadership in the industry. In the end, NIKE is doing what we always do. We are staying on the offense. Our confidence as we look long term hasn't changed one bit. We've been resolute in fueling innovation and our brand is as strong as ever. NIKE's unique strengths continue to set the pace and keep us in the lead.  And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt. Matt Friend : Thank you, John, and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE has become more agile, responsive and resilient over the past 2 years through the operational capabilities and playbook that we have developed to navigate the unexpected. This past quarter, the operating environment shifted rapidly as the latest COVID variant presented new challenges to business operations. And our teams around the world were prepared to do what was necessary to continue to serve the consumer. Our ability to optimize near-term performance through heightened levels of volatility while continuing to make strategic progress on Consumer Direct Acceleration reinforces NIKE's positioning as a portfolio of leading brands with unlimited potential. Marketplace demand continues to significantly exceed available inventory supply, with a healthy pull market across our geographies. When inventory supply is available in region, we are quickly moving it to the appropriate channels to serve consumer demand. Consumers continue to shift towards digital to find the products they love, and NIKE's digital experience continues to build deep consumer connections and capture digital market share. Now let me briefly update on the supply chain. All factories in Vietnam are operational, with total footwear and apparel production in line with pre-closure volumes and our forward-looking demand plans. Nearly all of our supplier base is operational without restrictions, and we are working closely with our partners around the world to navigate through the most recent risks related to COVID. Inventory supply in our geographies is beginning to improve from here. Transit times, however, remain elevated. And in the case of North America, transit times in the third quarter have worsened. We have taken numerous actions to address these challenges, and in many cases, to protect against lead times increasing even further. Despite these ongoing challenges, we have been able to mitigate our transit delay impact by nearly 4 weeks versus industry averages. I am so proud of how our teams continue to respond, demonstrating how to win in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment. Now consumer demand for all 3 of our brands, NIKE, Jordan and Converse, remains incredibly strong. Our growth in the third quarter would have been even higher if we had greater quantities of available inventory to meet marketplace demand. Across the marketplace, holiday retail sales finished strong, and spring retail sales are off to a great start, fueled by strong demand for performance men's running, Air Jordan 1, classics footwear and our apparel fleece franchises. We are also sustaining a higher full-price mix with year-over-year improvement in markdown activity. NIKE Digital has seen improvement in conversion rates and lower customer returns despite having lower levels of available inventory in our most desired product franchises. And in Greater China, we saw improvement in full price realization versus the prior season. Speaking of product, we continue to refresh and reimagine our most iconic franchises through design, collaboration and creative storytelling. We are expanding the contribution of our express lane in all geographies to make more locally relevant product on shorter lead times, yielding higher rates of sell-through and profitability for NIKE and our partners. We continue to deliver a consistent flow of product innovation in performance sports like running, basketball and training and through platforms like ZoomX, FlyEase and Space Hippie with the crater foam. Our product is our most valuable form of demand creation, and we have a highly loyal and engaged audience eager to share in the stories we have to tell around our athletes and products. This quarter, the NIKE Brand registered as both the #1 cool and #1 favorite brand in all 12 of our key cities around the world. Recent product announcements ranging from our collaboration with Drake on the NOCTA Line of apparel and sneakers, to the Ted Lasso-AFC Richmond kits for the show's third season speaks to the depth of our cultural reach. Our brands live at the intersection of sport, media, music and increasingly, technology, enabling us to be highly relevant to today's youth. As I've said repeatedly over the past year, NIKE's market opportunity is larger than ever. Consumer interest in sport, health and well-being has never been greater. And consumers' desire to wear athletic inspired footwear and apparel in more moments of their lives is here to stay. NIKE will always be a growth company, fueled through innovation to help all athletes achieve their full potential. Now continuing with the theme of growth, John said earlier that our marketplace strategy is a growth strategy. And so I'd like to go a little deeper on where we are in our journey to create the marketplace of the future, including how we have managed our wholesale portfolio. Over the past 4 years, we have reduced the number of wholesale accounts worldwide by more than 50% while delivering strong revenue growth through NIKE Direct and our remaining wholesale partners. We are now moving into the next phase of our marketplace strategy. We have finished communicating the big account pivots. And our go-forward growth plans are aligned with our wholesale partners. Wholesale partners play an integral role in our future marketplace, first, to authenticate our brands and then to create scale of distribution through a consistent consumer experience across a larger retail footprint. We will drive healthy wholesale growth with our remaining wholesale partners and recapture dislocated demand by elevating our partner's retail environment and digitally connecting NIKE membership with their retail experience. Take, for example, our collaboration with James Whitner's Whitaker Group, owner of Social Status and other sneaker boutiques. We recently partnered with The Whitaker Group to develop unique silhouettes of Jordan and Dunk products as well as produce SNKRS Live content to connect our brand to important communities. We are committed to driving growth with partners like this as they create authentic, deeply connected consumer concepts in key cities and communities around the world. NIKE Digital continues to be our fastest-growing component of the marketplace. This quarter, downloads of the NIKE mobile app accelerated, and member buying frequency and average order values improved again as we continue to test member engagement across activity, content, community and commerce. In Q3, NIKE Digital gained 3 points from the prior year and now represents 26% of our total NIKE Brand revenue. We're investing in NIKE stores to specifically address gaps in distribution to serve the growth opportunities we see in women's apparel and Jordan. Our NIKE Live concept is showing promising levels of productivity per square foot, store profitability and new member acquisition. We continue to obsess over the consumer experience and perfect the concept for her to maximize the incremental growth opportunity in the marketplace. We will also begin testing a Jordan-only concept in North America in fiscal '23, leveraging a popular consumer experience that has been wildly successful in Greater China, the Philippines and Korea. Our approach is to first pilot these new concepts, iterate and perfect, and then move to scale. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have seen how creating the marketplace of the future will deepen our connections with consumers, fuel marketplace growth and expand the profit pool for NIKE and our wholesale partners. Now let me turn to the details of our third quarter financial results and operating segment performance. NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 5% and 8% on a currency-neutral basis, led by 17% growth in NIKE Direct. Wholesale returned to growth, up 1% on a currency-neutral basis. NIKE Digital grew 22%, fueled by strong demand through our NIKE app. NIKE-owned stores grew 14% with significant improvements in traffic during the quarter. Gross margin increased 100 basis points versus the prior year, driven primarily by higher NIKE Direct margins due to lower markdowns, favorable foreign currency exchange rates and a higher full price mix, partially offset by increased freight and logistics costs. SG&A grew 13% versus the prior year, primarily due to strategic technology investments, normalization of investment against brand campaigns, wage-related expenses and digital marketing investment to fuel heightened digital demand. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.4% compared to 11.4% for the same period last year. This was due to a shift in our earnings mix, effects of stock-based compensation and recently finalized U.S. tax regulations. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.87. Now let's review the operating segments. In North America, Q3 revenue grew 9% and EBIT was flat. NIKE continued to drive momentum through key product franchises across men's, women's and kids. This was highlighted by double-digit growth in key men's running franchises like Pegasus as well as updates on franchises like the Winflo and Vomero. NIKE Direct grew 27% versus the prior year, led by NIKE Digital delivering industry-leading growth, increasing 33% versus the prior year, driven by double-digit growth in traffic, strong growth in new members and member engagement and improvements in member buying frequency. NIKE Digital in North America now has the highest penetration of all the geographies, representing 1/3 of total North America revenue in the quarter. NIKE-owned stores grew 16% due to traffic improving towards pre-pandemic levels and successful activations in key cities during moments like the Super Bowl in L.A. North America continues to experience strong full price realization and low markdown rates across the marketplace as inventory supply begins to improve. NIKE-owned inventory levels increased 22% versus the prior year, with in-transit inventory now representing 65% of total inventory at the end of the quarter, as transit times are now more than 6 weeks longer than pre-pandemic levels and 2 weeks longer than the same period in the prior year. In order to ensure the right assortment of products arrive on time for the fall selling season, we have moved forward our buying time lines to accommodate for longer transit times. In EMEA, Q3 revenue grew 13% on a currency-neutral basis, with growth across all consumer segments, and EBIT grew 34% on a reported basis. Retail sales across the marketplace grew strong double digits with improvements in full price realization and lower average markdown rates. Team Sports continues to make its comeback and the continuation of the Champions League tournament enabled global football to drive energy across the region. The momentum behind the Jordan brand in EMEA is also driving strong growth across all consumer segments, led by women's. NIKE Direct grew 22% on a currency-neutral basis, led by growth in NIKE-owned stores of 44% as we compare to uneven store closures due to COVID-related government restrictions in the prior year. NIKE Digital rose 11%, fueled by member-only access and app-exclusive releases, an another quarter of strong double-digit growth in full price demand. Wholesale revenue grew 10%, led by even stronger growth rates from our strategic accounts. As John mentioned in his remarks, we remain focused on the safety and well-being of our teammates regarding the deeply troubling crisis unfolding in Ukraine. Our own stores and digital commerce operations remain paused in Russia and Ukraine. As a note, our business in both countries represent less than 1% of total company revenue. In Greater China, Q3 revenue declined 8% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT declined 19% on a reported basis. Our results for this quarter were in line with our expectations, with sequential improvement versus the prior quarter. As we continued rebuilding local brand activities again this quarter, NIKE was rated the #1 cool and #1 favorite brand in China, creating separation and distinction versus the competition. And as I said earlier, we are observing continued improvement in full price realization. Greater China delivered over $2 billion in revenue this quarter, driven by the Lunar New Year period as Nike.com saw record weekly traffic. We leveraged our Express Lane capabilities to design hyperlocal products with the Year Of The Tiger elements, resulting in strong sell-through across men's, women's, kids and Jordan. Speaking of Jordan, the brand had a record quarter for revenue in the region, growing versus the prior year through momentum in both footwear and apparel. NIKE Direct was down 11% on a currency-neutral basis, with declines in both digital and physical retail channels. COVID-related lockdowns continue to create challenges for retail traffic. NIKE-owned stores were down 5% and Digital declined 19% due to the ongoing supply delays that negatively impacted timing of product launches. We created marketplace energy with the opening of NIKE Beijing, the first connected partner-operated Rise door and 2 new Unite doors that set consecutive records for global opening sales. Our relentless focus on sport, product innovation and our most iconic product franchises, combined with local athlete storytelling, remains a competitive advantage for us in Greater China. We are closely monitoring the current situation regarding the virus, but we are encouraged by the momentum we are building in the marketplace. Now moving to APLA. Q3 revenue grew 19% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT grew 17% on a reported basis. This quarter was the largest and most profitable in the history of the APLA region. We saw double-digit currency-neutral growth across nearly all territories led by Korea, Mexico and SOKO. We're winning with the consumer in sport across performance and lifestyle, demonstrated by strong growth in running, fitness, Jordan and Classics. NIKE Direct grew 39%, led by NIKE Digital growth of 61% due to record-setting member days across a number of territories, delivering more than 2.5x the demand versus a typical week. NIKE-owned stores grew 17% while the wholesale channel grew 9%. Our focus on localized product and content, particularly the launch of our Kwondo1 collaboration with K-Pop star G-Dragon demonstrated yet again our deep connection to consumers. It was APLA's biggest hyperlocal launch ever, reaching 91 million users on social and 3.8 million entries across SNKRS and our marketplace partners. Now let's turn to our financial outlook. We continue to expect revenue for the full year to grow mid-single digits versus the prior year. As you know, comparing quarters to prior periods has not been intuitive, so we continue to look at the size, trend and health of our business, market share and profitability relative to pre-pandemic periods, and we remain confident we are on track towards our long-term financial goals. Specifically for the fourth quarter, in North America, we expect a decline in revenue due to year-over-year comparisons. And in Greater China, we expect to see another quarter of sequential improvement while we closely monitor the operational impact related to recent COVID lockdowns. We now expect gross margin to expand by at least 150 basis points versus the prior year as strong consumer demand continues to fuel high levels of full price realization, low markdown rates and low customer returns. Benefits of strategic pricing expected in Q4 are being partially offset by elevated product costs, primarily due to higher macro input costs, supply chain costs and strategic actions to expedite delivery of product in North America. Despite the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we continue to expect foreign exchange to be a 55 basis point tailwind versus the prior year. We now expect SG&A to grow mid-teens for the full year as our spend normalizes, and we continue to advance our capabilities to support our ongoing digital transformation. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be in the low teens for the fiscal year. And as we look ahead to fiscal '23, we are optimistic as our brand strength is unparalleled with a strong product pipeline and momentum against our largest growth drivers. Marketplace demand continues to exceed available supply as inventory supply begins to normalize in the fourth quarter, against the context of a healthy pull market, setting the foundation for another year of strong growth. We are focused on what we can control while there are several new dynamics creating higher levels of volatility. As a result, we will provide more specific financial guidance for fiscal '23 during our fourth quarter earnings call. In closing, our strategy is working. NIKE's brand strength and consumer demand remains at an all-time high and we are confident in our business momentum. Our deep focus on the consumer and sport is what sets us apart from the rest. We continue to leverage the same principles for how we are strategically and financially managing the company. And as we approach our 50-year anniversary, we are reminded of NIKE's rich history of delivering consistent results even through periods of uncertainty as we build NIKE for the future.  With that, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of John Kernan with Cowen. John Kernan : So Matt, as we get into the fourth quarter and into the first half of 2023, can you talk to how you see product flows improving? And do you think you'll be able to meet this elevated level of demand as we go into the first half of your fiscal '23? Matt Friend : Yes. Sure, John. Well, maybe I'll start by just saying that Vietnam at this point in time is operational and our production volume is on plan. And while transit times remain elevated, particularly getting into the North America marketplace, beginning in the fourth quarter, we're going to start seeing an improved flow of supply. And so we are increasingly confident in that reality and continue to manage that dynamic with our partners, our factory partners and our transit partners around the world. Consumer demand continues to be incredibly strong. And while we've not been able to meet demand over the past couple of quarters, we're in a healthy pull market with that strong demand. And as a result of that, we really believe that, that sets a strong foundation for growth in the first half of fiscal '23 but for fiscal '23 in total. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Katharine McShane : I wondered if you could talk a little bit more about the new model with your wholesale partners. Can we expect to see a further refinement of what your differentiated retail strategy is with this new model? And what is the timing of the rollout for this newer strategy? John Donahoe : Yes. Thanks, Kate. Let me just start by reminding us why we're driving this, what we're calling NIKE Marketplace. And it's driven by the consumer, who I have this phrase of saying, consumers want to get what they want, when they want it, how they want it. And they expect us to know who they are regardless of channel, and they want a very consistent and premium experience. And so starts with NIKE Digital. I won't go into that, but the clear competitive separation in our digital capabilities. But wholesale plays a very, very important role in that, as I said in my remarks and Matt reinforced. And so we will continue to build strategic partnerships with our wholesale partners, in particular, around the ability to link our membership program so that consumers know that NIKE knows who they are, even through the wholesale channel and allows both of us to grow. And then NIKE Direct, our own mono-brand stores, will continue to play a role, an increased role, in particular, focusing on a couple of areas of the market where we feel like there's incremental need to reach the consumer, particularly around women's, around apparel, and as Matt mentioned, around Jordan. And so we'll increase our mono-brand stores over the coming years. But as Matt said, importantly, we're going to take an intelligent approach to that, where we're going to test, iterate and learn so that we get the consumer construct and consumer experiences in our mono brand store is clear before we rapidly expand. And so that expansion will happen some in fiscal '23 but even more so in fiscal '24 and '25. But again, the main goal is to be able to have consumers almost be indifferent where and how they have a first-rate NIKE experience. Matt Friend : Yes. And I'd just add, Kate, that the point I was trying to make is that for the past several years, we have been editing our account portfolio. And at this pivot in time, we have made the edits and communicated those edits to our partners. And we're focused now on driving growth through our remaining wholesale partners. And to create the marketplace of the future, both through digital, our owned stores and our partners, it's going to require us to also invest with our partners in their consumer experiences so that the consumer has a premium consistent experience as they move across the marketplace and can find the NIKE product when and where they want it. John Donahoe : One other thing I just want to really reinforce because I think there was some confusion on this, that's around Foot Locker. To be crystal clear, Foot Locker always has been and always will be a large and important partner of NIKE's. And that will continue to be the case. And they'll have a very distinct role in our marketplace strategy as a wholesaler, with a particular focus on the culture of basketball, on the sneaker culture and on kids, which is a really big and important opportunity for us. So just to be clear, they are one of our important partners going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jay Sole with UBS. Jay Sole : My question is about China. Matt, when you said you expect sequential growth in fourth quarter, can you maybe give us a little bit more color on that? Do you expect the growth to turn positive on a year-over-year basis? And maybe if you can dive in a little bit more about what gives you conviction in both the near term and the long-term opportunity in China, if you could elaborate on that, that would be appreciated. Matt Friend : Yes, sure, Jay. So what I said specifically was we expect to see sequential improvement in the fourth quarter versus what we delivered in Q3. And that's based on the momentum that we're seeing in the marketplace. We're highly encouraged with our Q3 performance and a second straight quarter of metrics and facts around the way our teams are executing in the marketplace, that gives us confidence from a brand and consumer point of view. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we were rated the #1 cool and #1 favorite brand in China. And this is the second straight quarter where we've increased our investment in demand creation in order to reestablish and rebuild those consumer connections. And we're seeing the impact of it. John referenced 1 example in our brand campaign around the Beijing Olympics and the high levels of reach, engagement and positive consumer sentiment that we saw. We also saw this quarter an improvement in full price realization. And our team continues to do a great job navigating through the environment. But what we really see, as we dig deep into the full price metrics, is that the Jordan brand grew, as I mentioned, in footwear and apparel. And we see consumer demand around local storytelling and local dimensions of our product franchises like the Year Of The Tiger and then just general consumer demand around our most popular footwear franchises continuing to drive growth versus the prior year. And so we're encouraged by this momentum and what it says in terms of our optimism to be able to return to a long-term growth algorithm. In the short term, we're operationally watching the COVID-related lockdowns in the marketplace. And the impact on the fourth quarter of these lockdowns is unclear at this moment, but it feels different. And so we're looking at the fourth quarter and our revenue guidance for the quarter and feel confident that we can still deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth on a full year basis. Jay Sole : Got it, okay. And then if I can ask you another question. You mentioned that you'll give more color on fiscal '23 on the fourth quarter call. But I mean, at a high level, the long-term guidance that you gave for fiscal '25 talked about high single-digit to low double-digit revenue growth. Do you expect fiscal '23 at a high level to be sort of an on-algorithm type of year as it were to deliver that kind of growth? Is there any sort of broad brushstroke kind of contours of fiscal '23 that you're thinking about right now? Matt Friend : Yes. We're looking at fiscal '23 and believe the foundation is set for another year of strong growth. And that's because our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy is working. Our brand is strong and continues to have -- create consumer demand at all-time highs. We're going to see inventory supply normalize this quarter, which gives us increased confidence that we'll have supply to meet the heightened levels of demand. And we've got a robust pipeline of product, and we're excited about the momentum that we're building in our biggest growth areas. So as we look to the long term, Jay, we continue to be optimistic and positive as it relates to our fiscal '25 long-term algorithm. Operator : We have the next question from Jonathan Komp with Baird. Jonathan Komp : One follow-up as a clarification. Given some of the sizable shifts in the North America wholesale marketplace, I think you referenced Foot Locker, are you expecting to see a negative impact or a headwind to your total North America revenue at any point? And then maybe just a broader question on your view of the health of the consumer and the ability to accept some of the pricing that's coming in, in the category and broadly the inflation and how that impacts your view on the gross margin outlook beyond fiscal '22. John Donahoe : Maybe I'll take the first part of that, Matt, and you take the second. Jonathan, on the first part, quite the contrary. We see this marketplace strategy positioning us even more strongly for healthy, sustainable growth in North America. And it starts with Digital. You saw the Digital growth rate in North America, I think it was 33% this past quarter. It's been very strong. And NIKE is one of the very few brands that's on the home screen of the mobile app. And we don't just have 1 mobile app. We have the NIKE Mobile app, the SNKRS mobile app, the NTC and NRC. And that is very scarce space to have clear digital competitive advantage. We also believe that it's going to become a healthier retail or wholesale, if you will, marketplace, as we described. We have our connected partnership and pilot we've done with DICK'S Sporting Goods, where we've taken one of our partners, one of our important strategic partners and we're learning together around connected membership. We have very strong initial results from that. Consumers really appreciate the fact that they know who we are and their NIKE members whether they're shopping at a DICK'S or shopping elsewhere. And we're working closely with DICK'S to provide that seamless experience. And as we learn more from that, we'll roll that connected partnership out to others. And then just to repeat, we believe in the North America marketplace in particular. There's a real need around women's, around Jordan and around some higher-end apparel where our mono brand stores, particularly NIKE Live concept, the 5,000- to 6,000-square-foot concept can really play a role in neighborhoods around North America. So we think that leads to a healthier marketplace that leads to even accelerated growth. Matt Friend : Yes. And just hitting the second part of your question, we continue to see strong consumer demand for our portfolio of brands. And that's been true for the past several quarters, and we know we haven't been able to meet marketplace demand with available inventory supply. We did implement a low single-digit price increase in the second half of this year or for the spring/summer '23 season to be more specific. And given the transit times delays, we'll start to see more of that hit the market in the fourth quarter. But our approach to pricing and to the consumer is a careful one. We evaluate the price value of our products on a season-by-season basis. And our financial model as a premium brand starts first with the value that we create for the consumer in our products. And so we're very careful about how we approach pricing, and we take a long-term view with regards to the consumer because of that relationship that we have. So as we look forward to the fourth quarter and fiscal '23, we're continuing to look at the opportunities for additional pricing, and we do see some. But as it relates to consumer demand for our brands, we continue to see strong consumer demand for our brands and for our products because they find value in our products. Operator : We have your next question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Great. And congrats on a nice quarter despite the dynamic backdrop. So John, can you elaborate on the spring demand that you're seeing for the brand and just your excitement for the product pipeline into next year? And Matt, as we move into phase 2 of the marketplace model, is there any way for us best to conceptualize wholesale versus direct-to-consumer margins maybe today relative to the opportunity that you see moving forward? John Donahoe : Yes, Matt, I'm so glad you asked this question because one of the things that just gives us extraordinary confidence in our outlook is the innovation pipeline. And it's been so much fun because a growing number of our teams are back together here on campus. Matt and I both spent a whole bunch of time over our new Serena Williams Building last week with Michael and Heidi and Andy and DJ and going through our products. And in person, physically touching the products in the pipeline, I can't tell you how energizing that is. And we have a very strong pipeline. And as Matt and I both described, that's both in our platforms and in our products. The FlyEase is just a great example of how NIKE has this extraordinary ability to take innovation insight. In this case, it was developed for people with ability challenges and now leverage it. You see it first with kids, right? One of the #1 challenges parents have is helping get their kids their shoes on in the morning or off at night. And this -- the Dynamo GO, along with several other new models coming that take advantage of FlyEase technology, both in lifestyle and performance. And now women and men's want to embrace the FlyEase and Converse as I mentioned. So that's a great example of a platform that's scaling and there's a strong innovation pipeline. And then we've got a great pipeline coming over the next 3 to 12 months of running, is a great example where we have updated models around Infinity, around Invincible, and we're really excited about Invincible. The next Pegasus models are quite strong so that will be coming. Very excited about the running line going forward. With women's, we just launched the Dri-FIT Alpha Bra. And in the pipeline is a really exciting next generation of leggings and bras that we think is just really going to continue to turbocharge our growth there. And obviously, the Free Metcon is seeing strong consumer demand already. And then with kids, we're bringing ACG into kids in the fall for the first time. In basketball, the G.T. Cut; in global football, the Phantom and the Mercurial and what is going to be an extraordinary. You think about the global football agenda for the next 15 months, both men's and women's, I can just tell you that our -- we are so excited about the product pipeline, both the breadth and the depth of it that -- and it's just fun to be able to really be together in person as our innovation teams continue to put the pedal to the metal. Matt Friend : Yes. And just on your margin question, Matt, the underlying drivers of the CDA are what's fueling our gross margin expansion. Obviously, this year, we're incredibly proud by 150 basis points or at least 150 basis points of gross margin expansion, where we've absorbed more than 100 basis points of unplanned costs associated with supply chain, logistics and wages to move product. And the large proportion of that actually sits in the North America marketplace. So when you look at the revenue and EBIT performance or operating income performance in North America, you're seeing a larger impact of that in that geography. As we look ahead to the marketplace shift, the underlying drivers are the same drivers. It's a higher mix of full price. It's us continuing to leverage our supply chain costs and fulfillment in order to drive more productivity. And while in the short term, we might see some normalization as inventory supply starts to flow, some normalization of channels because wholesale has had a little less product over the last couple of quarters to the normalization of full price because with lack of supply, we've got a couple of our geographies with full price realization that's well above our definition of 65% for full marketplace health. But that doesn't change our confidence in our ability to drive high 40s gross margin by fiscal year '25 and beyond. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Adrienne Yih : Let me add my congratulations. We really are going see the shift to digital DTC. Along those lines, Matt, would it be fair to say that obviously, the digital DTC is going to play a much bigger role to get to those fiscal '25 targets? And can you get there without China coming back to that algorithm, 13% to 15% growth? And are the EBIT margins in those 2 channels relatively similar? Matt Friend : Adrienne, we've got a strong portfolio of brands, products, geographies, and we're encouraged by the momentum that we're seeing in Greater China. As it relates to Digital, as both John and I mentioned on the call, the growth we continue to deliver through that channel continues to be fantastic and it's the consumer that's leading that transition. To be able to deliver double-digit traffic -- growth in traffic in North America this past quarter really stood out as an outlier relative to where other brands and retailers were seeing traffic growth. And to us, it's a signal of the strength of our brand and the fact that the consumer continues to choose this channel to engage, the fact that the app downloads have increased on a quarter-over-quarter basis, the fact that we're seeing the app drive a greater proportion of our overall business connects membership. And the way that we're going to try to connect membership into the marketplace, we continue to feel very strong that Consumer Direct Acceleration led by Digital is what's going to drive us towards that fiscal year '25 goal. And as we've mentioned before, we earn a higher gross margin on our sales through the digital channels, and we expect to see leverage in our costs, which will enable us to hit that high teens operating profit over the multiyear period. Paul Trussell : All right. Well, thank you very much, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Take care. Have a good night. John Donahoe : Thanks, everyone. Matt Friend : Thank you. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So we would appreciate you limiting your initial question to one. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I will now turn the call over to Nike Inc., President and CEO, John Donahoe. John Donahoe : Thank you, Paul, and hello to everyone on today's call. This quarter, NIKE celebrated our 50th anniversary. On May 1, 1972, NIKE became its own company, a new standalone brand with its own mission and vision. As Phil and I put it recently, back then all we had was a dream, a ton of ambition, a trunk full of shoes and a big Swoosh on all of them. And over the 50 years since, NIKE has been a growth company. For 5 decades now, we innovated for athletes, redefining sport for generation after generation. And today, we're the biggest champion in the world for athletes and for sport, and we've inspired a global community and remain driven by the power of sport to create a better world. This spring, we've been celebrating our 50th anniversary across the globe, and these moments have been particularly special as many of us have now returned to our workplaces. It's been great to see the collaboration and creativity as we strengthen our culture of innovation, team and community. I have personally loved feeling the energy of our teammates being back together again. In fact, I got to feel that energy, not just here in our campus in Oregon, but also across Europe when a group of us visited our team there a few weeks back. After a couple of years of virtual meetings, it was great to finally spend time with our European teammates in person. Another highlight from that trip was touring our European Logistics Center in Laakdal, Belgium, and getting to see first-hand how efficiency and sustainability help us serve our consumers while minimizing our environmental impact. And I love getting a chance to spend some time with some of the players on England's Women's National Football team, The Lionesses, who were inspiring as they prepare for the Women's EURO Champs in England this summer. Seeing our European teammates in person, again, reminds me of how deeply grateful I am to all of our 79,000 global teammates. As we conclude this fiscal year, our NIKE, Inc. team has navigated so much together, working with commitment and resilience to serve our consumers and our communities. And our teams have proven their ability to be unrelenting in executing against the macro complexities while also building our future. In particular, I want to acknowledge our Greater China team, who have managed the business through a challenging period for them and their families. I've said it before, and I'll say it again, this team is the greatest collection of talent in the world, and I sincerely thank them. This fiscal year and certainly this past quarter, macroeconomic challenges have created a dynamic environment. And yet, looking at our full fiscal year '22 results, it's clear that our strategy is working and that NIKE's unique competitive advantages continue to drive the business. Today, we're better positioned to drive sustainable long-term growth than we were before the pandemic. Over the past 2 years, we've transformed our business, building a muscle that won't just help us navigate future adversity, but one that gives us the ability and agility to continue to drive our growth. We now have a proven operational playbook with many levers at our disposal. Fiscal '22 posed operational headwinds throughout the year, but we continue to invest. As other companies have pulled back, our investments have made us stronger. And we're excited by what we see as we look at our growth opportunities and the strong consumer demand we continue to enjoy. And as we look ahead to fiscal '23, we remain very confident in our long-term strategy and our growth outlook. Our structural tailwinds, which include the expanded definition of sport, the societal movement toward health and wellness and comfort and the fundamental shift in consumer behavior toward digital, continue to create energy for us. These advantages, along with our size and scale, the strength of our portfolio of brands and having the right strategy, give us the confidence to move even faster against the opportunities we see ahead. Now NIKE's growth has been and will continue to be the result of 3 areas I'll walk through today. First, our brand deeply connects with consumers, fueled by authenticity and sport and compelling storytelling. Second, our culture of innovation drives a continuous pipeline of new products. And third, we continue to have a competitive advantage in digital as one of the few brands that can connect with and directly serve consumers at scale. So let's start with the strength of the NIKE brand. You've heard me say that these are times when strong brands can get stronger and that has never been more clear than it is today. Our passion for sport continues to drive our deep connections with consumers. While visiting our team in Europe, I was able to attend the NIKE versus NIKE FA Cup final which Liverpool won in the thrilling penalty shoot-out over Chelsea at Wembley Stadium. In April, Scottie Scheffler won the masters. And earlier this month, Rafael Nadal won his 14th French Open. And it's been a great month for basketball as the WNBA season kicked off and an incredible NBA season concluded. The power of our full portfolio of brands was felt with NIKE Basketball highly visible as the official supplier and partner for both leagues, and Converse and Jordan showing up proud in the NBA finals with Draymond Green and Jayson Tatum, respectively. It was also a quarter defined by a series of only NIKE moments, none bigger than the April unveiling of the Serena Williams Building here in our campus. This 1 million square foot building is the new home for our design and product creation teams. More than 200,000 square feet is dedicated to lab space, which allows our innovation and product creation teams to test new ideas in developing, presenting and merchandising products. And along with the LeBron James Innovation Center that opened last fall, these facilities represent the single greatest investment in sports science, research, innovation and design in the world. Also in the quarter, we were thrilled to launch the Nike Athlete Think Tank which brought a group of female athletes together on our campus to share their experience and insight. The 13 athletes, including Serena, Sabrina and Shalane also selected community organizations that NIKE will help fund through grants. Soon, we plan to grow the Think Tank, creating even more long-term impact at the grassroots level fueled by our goal of empowering the next generation of women in sport. This quarter, we also connected with our consumer through a powerful brand campaign tied to our 50th anniversary. The film directed by and starring Spike Lee, celebrates NIKE's past and the promise of our future. The film was complemented by programming across our app ecosystem Nike.com, social media and more to incredibly strong consumer response. In fact, our 50th anniversary campaign led to the highest NIKE commerce app traffic in our history, even higher than some of the major commercial moments in the past, which once again shows how brand heat can translate to member engagement. We saw particular energy with Gen Z as our campaigns song went viral on TikTok, reaching #1 on the list of top trending TikTok songs. Another only NIKE moment in Q4 was the launch of No Off-Season, our podcast focused on mental health and starring athletes, including Karl-Anthony Towns and Laurie Hernandez. We created this podcast to help redefine sport for our new generation as another new and creative way we drive relationships with consumers with an energy and scale as only NIKE can. And finally, we began the next chapter of our relationship with Kobe Bryant and his family this quarter as we launched a new Kobe shoe that pays honor to Gigi Bryant, with all profits donated to the Mamba and Mambacita Sports Foundation. This was a launch with deep global resonance from L.A. to Shanghai with much more to come as we continue to build our Kobe business within our portfolio of signature franchises. My second point today is our relentless pipeline of innovative products, which continues to drive separation between us and our competition. No other brand has our ability to resource all and scale in response to a consumer opportunity. In Q4, we again introduced new performance innovations to the market, including new footwear technology from both NIKE Women's and the Jordan brand. In women's, we launched the NIKE Spark Flyknit, a new lifestyle shoe that introduces NIKE Running's latest innovation, the Spark cushioning system. Spark offers a new sense of comfort and energy return through its dual density foam midsole. The Spark Flyknit is one of the first projects from our NIKE Sports research lab focused on injecting performance technology into lifestyle products. In this case, responding to the consumer insight requesting a women's shoe for those who are on their feet all day long. Moving forward, we will be scaling our use of performance innovation into lifestyle footwear with a special focus on the opportunity we see in the women's business. And in Jordan, this quarter, Luka Don\u010di\u0107 debuted its hotly anticipated Luka 1 signature shoe during the NBA playoffs. The Luka 1 introduces a brand-new performance foam called Formula 23, which provides a lightweight and responsive ride, the fitting of one of the game's best players. Formula 23 is one of the most sustainable performance foams ever made by NIKE and Jordan now plans to scale it across its product line, including into its next Air Jordan shoe. And speaking of sustainability, we continue to scale our industry-leading solutions in this space. In April, we launched new sustainable iterations of 2 footwear icons, the Pegasus Turbo Next Nature running shoe and the Mercurial Vapor Next Nature football boot, both of which are made with at least 50% recycled content by weight. Next Nature continues the work we started with Space Hippie with plans to scale even further across our franchises. And we're also innovating how we reduced waste beyond individual products and franchises. This led to the NIKE Re-Creation program, in which vintage and obsolete products are collected and used to create new, locally designed and manufactured products. The program, which combines design, retail and distribution, launched in L.A. with plans to expand to London and Paris in fiscal '23, building a local ecosystem in all 3 cities. We know that singular is the future of sustainability and these local ecosystems creating the exciting beginnings of a fully circular infrastructure at NIKE. And looking ahead, we're excited to introduce a new platform that we believe has the potential to change the apparel industry. It's a new material that brings together scale, innovation, sustainability and design like only NIKE can. This material isn't a knit or a woven. And it significantly reduces environmental impact through fewer carbon emissions and by not using water or dyes. We believe this platform could do for apparel what Flyknit did for footwear. Its first products will be unveiled this September, and we can't wait for all of you to see it. Now for my third and final point today, NIKE's increasing digital advantage. With an owned digital business that grew 18% in fiscal '22, we continue to set the pace in our industry by creating a premium, consistent and seamless experience that drives one-to-one consumer experiences at scale. This quarter, our app ecosystem grew into an even greater share of our total digital demand, helping our digital share of the business reached 24% in Q4. This is a shift being led by the consumer as they pursue the most personalized shopping experience NIKE provides. And we do not take lightly the choice made by consumers to put us in the most prized real estate that exists today, the home screening of their phone. No other brand occupies that space globally like NIKE and it remains one of our biggest competitive advantages. Moving to physical retail. We continue to bring to life our vision of giving consumers personalized digital experiences regardless of channel. We know that consumers expect us to know who they are online or offline and across the full array of mono-brand stores, NIKE Digital and our wholesale partners. Within our NIKE-owned stores, higher levels of connectivity across physical and digital are simply driving a better consumer experience. Online to off-line services, such as Buy Online Pick Up in Store, and ship from store are driving growth with 100% of our North America stores now offering at least one element of O2O. And in addition to our owned physical retail, we continue to innovate and codesign great partner experiences and business models to better know and serve consumers. We started this journey through connected inventory to provide better allocation, extend product choice for consumers and reduce friction such as products being out of stock. And increasingly, we're moving beyond inventory to a broader approach of knowing and serving our consumers as NIKE members, particularly when shopping through our retail partners. As you know, this is a journey we announced in Q2 through our partnerships with DICK'S Sporting Goods to connect member accounts. And then we continued in Q3 with NSP partners in Greater China. And with clear success thus far in knowing our shared members better, our strategy expanded in Q4 to serving our shared members one-to-one through connected data. Consumers are responding to the meaningful benefits we're now testing and we'll continue to extend the best of NIKE to our members across the marketplace with additional partners and expanded services in fiscal '23. At the same time, our growing participation in new digital platforms continues to expand access points to NIKE across the digital ecosystem. After last quarter's first official NIKE NFT collaboration with RTFKT, we took another step in our journey to serve our community with innovative virtual products in Q4. Our first co-branded virtual sneaker, the RTFKT by NIKE Dunk Genesis CRYPTOKICKS, continues our connection with an audience that will help shape the future of sport and culture. In the end, as we look to start a new fiscal year, NIKE will do what we've done for 50 years now, and that stay on the offense. We have a proven playbook and our unique strengths and competitive advantages give us even more confidence about our future. Our focus is on the long term, and we're not slowing down. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt. Matthew Friend : Thanks, John, and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE's 50th year has been a year of transformation. Through dynamic conditions, our team has remained focused on what we can control, continuing to lead with speed, agility and responsiveness. Most importantly, we stayed focused on accelerating our strength and building NIKE for the future. . In this environment, what guides us is a relentless focus on creating value for our consumer and what fuels our confidence is the way our consumer is responding. Fiscal '22 was our largest revenue year ever, even with supply constraints challenging our ability to serve consumer demand. We are optimistic as we enter fiscal '23, with our source base fully operational, production surpassing pre-pandemic levels and inventory flowing again into our largest geographies. As we set the foundation for another year of strong growth, I'd like to provide some broader context around our strategic transformation. Two years ago, we introduced a bold new phase of our strategy, our Consumer Direct Acceleration. In the early months of the pandemic, we set our sights beyond simply navigating through short-term volatility. Instead, we outlined a clear vision to pursue even further competitive separation by expanding our digital advantage, reshaping the marketplace of the future, and creating deeper, more direct consumer relationships. Today, NIKE's continued momentum shows that our strategy is working. As we look forward, let me briefly highlight 3 of NIKE's foundational elements for long-term value creation, our global portfolio, our consumer-led digital transformation and our expanding direct-to-consumer operational capabilities. First, one of NIKE's greatest strengths is our unrivaled global portfolio. Together, NIKE, Jordan and Converse, represents 3 of the world's most connected consumer brands, dimensionalized across sports and lifestyle, footwear and apparel, up and down price points, throughout geographies at the center of cultural relevance. Today, NIKE is the #1 cool and #1 favorite brand in all 12 of our key cities around the world, leading as the champion for athletes and sport. With a sharpened consumer construct across men's, women's and kids, we're deepening our sport focus, expanding our product pipeline, and accelerating our long-term growth potential. The next chapter of our partnership with Kobe Bryant and the Bryant family is just one example of how we continue to bring new energy and dimension to our portfolio. Jordan Brand's momentum has also been unstoppable, with some of the most exciting young athletes in sport and some of the most iconic products in the world. Since fiscal '20, Jordan Women's has tripled. International geographies have grown over 60% and apparel has grown over 50%. Now with approximately $5 billion in revenue, fiscal '22 was Jordan's biggest year ever, with epic growth potential ahead. Converse also delivered incredible milestones in fiscal '22. Product and storytelling through the lens of youth and creativity are resonating deeply with growing strength among women consumers. As Converse scaled its digital offense and invest in new product creation, the impact is clear with global revenue approaching $2.3 billion, total digital penetration reaching 27% globally and EBIT more than doubling since fiscal '20. Across all 3 of our brands, we're driving a more direct, digital and differentiated future and I wouldn't trade our position with anyone. Next, our consumer-led digital transformation is driving long-term growth and value. A more digitally connected NIKE is a more valuable NIKE. Today, our own digital business, representing over $10 billion in revenue, is more than double in size versus pre-pandemic levels. After increasing market share and gaining 3 percentage points from the prior year, NIKE Digital now represents 24% of total brand revenue. More importantly, we are accelerating the pace and scale of NIKE's direct consumer connections. With growing digital traffic and NIKE App downloads, our apps now represent almost 50% of total digital demand. In turn, increased digital engagement is translating into more repeat buyers, a higher buying frequency and increased average order value, ultimately driving higher lifetime value through membership. And as retail consolidation continues and consumers converge around fewer digital platforms, a distinct NIKE consumer experience is driving more direct connections, positioning us well for long-term growth. Lastly, we are transforming our operating model with new capabilities in order to move at the speed of the consumer. This year, we will begin to see value from our biggest investment in NIKE's Digital transformation, our new ERP. As we shift to an increasingly direct-to-consumer future, an ERP will be foundational for increasing speed and agility across our supply chain. This will give us real-time visibility to inventory across our network, plus dynamic transactional capabilities to optimize consumer demand and inventory productivity. We will go live with our new ERP in Greater China in July and continue building and testing in North America for deployment in fiscal '24. We will also see a new consumer marketing offense in action in fiscal '23. Through new capabilities activated in partnership with Adobe, we will unlock additional productivity and demand creation and member retention across our NIKE ecosystem. We have started testing audience segmentation in North America with real-time data and personalized journeys on the NIKE app with plans for further expansion in the coming months. In Greater China, we are also accelerating our digital capabilities, building on our 40-year history in the market with an ecosystem from China and for China. In fiscal '23, we will deliver a new suite of commerce and support activity apps, deepening our connections with Chinese consumers through an enhanced user experience, including locally relevant features across our digital apps, services and our owned and partner retail stores. Finally, we continue to scale our Express Lane, which combines hyper local consumer insights with improved responsiveness and speed to market. In fiscal '22, Express Lane drove approximately 25% of total NIKE Brand revenue with higher profitability. We expect to build Express Lane into a larger portion of our business in fiscal '23 and beyond. Now let me turn to NIKE, Inc. fourth quarter financial results and operating segment performance. In Q4, NIKE, Inc. revenue declined 1% and grew 3% on a currency-neutral basis. This was led by 11% growth in NIKE Direct, offset by a 3% decline in wholesale. NIKE Digital grew 18%, fueled by strong demand across our app ecosystem. Fourth quarter reported gross margin declined 80 basis points versus the prior year. This was primarily due to specific actions taken to manage supply and demand in Greater China following COVID-related disruption as well as elevated freight and logistics costs. Headwinds were partially offset by benefits from strategic pricing actions, favorable foreign currency exchange rates, improved NIKE Direct margins and a higher full price mix. SG&A grew 8% in Q4, primarily due to strategic technology investments, increased NIKE Direct variable costs, wage-related expenses and increased demand creation expenses. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was negative 4.7%. This was due to a shift in our earnings mix and a noncash onetime benefit related to the onshoring of our non-U.S. intangible property. Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.90. This includes a $0.10 nonrecurring noncash charge related to both the deconsolidation of our Russian operations as well as the transition of our Argentina, Chile and Uruguay businesses to a strategic distributor model. Finally, inventories were $8.4 billion, up 23% compared to the prior year period. This was driven by elevated in-transit inventories due to extended lead times from ongoing supply chain disruptions, partially offset by strong consumer demand. Now let's move to our operating segments. In North America, Q4 revenue declined 5% and EBIT declined 18%, in line with our expectations as we lapped supply shifts in the previous year. Elevated ocean freight and logistics costs continue to dampen near-term profitability in this geography. NIKE-owned inventory grew 30% versus the prior year, with extended lead times causing in-transit inventory to be 65% of our total inventory at the end of the quarter. Wholesale revenue declined 12% due to inventory supply constraints. Strong marketplace demand drove closeout units down double digits versus the prior year. NIKE Direct grew 5% versus the prior year, delivering its highest quarterly revenue ever. Marketplace channel growth was led by 11% growth in NIKE Digital with another quarter of historically low markdown rates and lower available inventory supply. NIKE Digital total penetration reached 27% for the quarter, led by strong NIKE app growth. Even with lean available inventory, our power franchises continue to resonate deeply. Pegasus led the wafer performance footwear, Jordan launch delivered a record-breaking quarter and classics such as Dunk and Blazer drove strong full price growth. Meanwhile, we continue to test and learn across our newest retail concepts, such as our NIKE Live doors, which are increasing member buying amongst women. In EMEA Q4 revenue grew 20% on a currency-neutral basis. EBIT grew 63% on a reported basis. With broad-based growth across channels, consumer dimensions and product engines, NIKE Direct grew 25% on a currency-neutral basis, powered by healthy retail traffic as we anniversary COVID-related closures from the prior year. NIKE Digital grew 21%, driven by positive launch sell-through, improved full price selling mix and lower markdown rates. Sport continues to power our EMEA marketplace, highlighted by growth in running and fitness, performance franchises such as Metcon and Mercurial and apparel launches such as the Alate bra in women's. Looking ahead, EMEA will kick off the most unprecedented 12 months of global football in NIKE's history, starting with the Women's EURO Champs this summer, Men's World Cup in the fall and Women's World Cup next summer, NIKE is meeting the moment with a complete offense, including new kit launches, new training and lifestyle assortments and a new Mercurial, Tiempo and Phantom footwear innovations across men's, women's and kids. Next, I'll provide some deeper color around our results in Greater China. In Q4, revenue declined 20% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT declined 55% on a reported basis. This follows the region's most widespread COVID disruption since 2020, impacting over 100 cities and over 60% of our business. As conditions shifted, our experienced local team acted quickly and decisively. We leverage the diverse logistics network and strong local partnerships, returning to 100% capacity at our central logistics center within 3 weeks. Our marketplace team also adjusted inventory to meet digital demand. As a result, NIKE Digital landed Q4 with low single-digit growth. Despite a dynamic operating environment, NIKE extended its leadership position as Chinese consumers' #1 cool and #1 favorite brand. We saw this translate into positive business impact on NIKE Tmall Super Brand Day, which drove 90% number demand penetration and nearly 1 billion impressions. NIKE also created a clear separation on 6/18 as the undisputed #1 store and #1 brand on Tmall sport channel, outperforming the market. In addition, as lockdowns lifted in specific trade zones in late April, May and early June, we saw improved store traffic and overall consumer demand. Key footwear franchises continue to win in the marketplace, led by G.T. Cut as the #1 style in performance basketball and Pegasus 39, which drove strong results in men's and women's running. Express Lane also drove incredible sell-through with locally inspired launches, such as the Air Force 1 logo and the head-to-toe street dance pack in footwear and apparel. As I mentioned earlier, we took specific actions in Q4 to recalibrate forward-looking supply and demand, prioritizing the return to a healthy pull market by the end of the second quarter. While there may be near-term risk of further COVID disruption, longer term, we continue to be encouraged by another quarter of brand momentum in the marketplace. As we turn to APLA, Q4 revenue grew 24% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT grew 31% on a reported basis, reflecting our largest quarter ever in the geography. We saw double-digit currency neutral growth across Korea, Mexico, Southeast Asia and India and Japan. NIKE Direct grew 43% on a currency-neutral basis, led by 59% growth from NIKE Digital. Membership fueled double-digit growth across all territories as our sneakers app drove its best ever quarter in Japan, Korea and Mexico. We also saw our biggest quarter women's, led by performance running, classics and lifestyle apparel. Kids led the way within NIKE Digital, up nearly 100% from last year. We're expanding support for a new generation, driving strong results with proven franchises such as the Court Borough plus newer innovations such as Dynamo GO. Now I'll turn to our financial outlook for fiscal '23. We enter the year confident in our brand strength, consumer connection, product pipeline and normalizing inventory supply into a healthy pull market in North America, EMEA and APLA. We continue to see momentum against our largest growth drivers and our most iconic product franchises. At the same time, we are closely monitoring consumer behavior, and the implications of high inflation on near-term economic growth and consumer demand. We are also taking a cautious approach to Greater China, given uncertainty around additional COVID disruptions. As such, we have factored various risk scenarios into our guidance for fiscal '23. We expect revenue for the full year to grow low double digits on a currency-neutral basis, partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds of approximately 400 basis points. In the first quarter, we expect real dollar revenue growth to be flat to slightly up versus the prior year due to COVID disruption in Greater China and more than 500 basis points impact from foreign exchange translation. We expect gross margins to be in the range of flat to declining by 50 basis points versus the prior year with a wider-than-usual range reflecting our consideration of a number of scenarios. We expect to benefit from mid-single-digit pricing actions and continued gains from our shift to a more direct business, offset by another 100 basis points headwind from elevated ocean freight costs, increased product costs, discrete supply chain investments and normalization of historically low markdown rates. We expect foreign exchange to be a 30 basis point headwind on gross margin due to strength in the U.S. dollar, largely offset in fiscal '23 by favorable hedge rates versus current spot rates. We expect gross margin pressure to exceed 100 basis points in the first quarter of fiscal '23, both as we recalibrate supply and demand in Greater China and as we anticipate higher promotional activity to sell seasonal inventory, which has arrived late due to a combination of factory closures and longer transit times. We expect SG&A to increase high single digits to low double digits as we continue to invest in our people, our brands, new stores and our transformational capabilities. And lastly, we expect the fiscal '23 effective tax rate to be in the mid-teens range. As we move forward, we will stay focused on what we can control and continue managing the business for the long term. This includes leveraging our scale and financial strength, optimizing supply and demand and most importantly, creating value for our consumer from the products we design to the stories we tell, to the experiences that we deliver. Our consumer-direct acceleration is working. Our long-term vision has never been more clear. And if there is anything that's 50 years of growth have proven, it's that with the right team and the right strategy, the future is ours to create. On that note, I'd like to close with a heartfelt thank you to the team that makes it all possible, the people behind the art, science and magic of NIKE. Our team is and always will be NIKE's greatest competitive advantage. And as proud as we are of all that NIKE has achieved over the past 50 years, what excites us most is what comes next. With that, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Robert Drbul : I was wondering if you could maybe just comment some more around China. I think when you look at what's happened over the last few months and even more recently with the reopening, just exactly how you're balancing the compares that you're facing versus the concerns that you have over the next few quarters? John Donahoe : Yes, Bob. Let me start simply by saying we're continuing to do what we've always done. As you know, NIKE been in China for 40 years. We've always taken a long-term view. And to be clear, we believe that China remains a growth market with significant potential to unlock. And we've got very strong equity with Chinese consumers, our team. I think Matt mentioned it, I mentioned it, our team has just done a phenomenal job over the last 10 weeks, but also over the last several years. And the fundamentals haven't really changed. So delivering innovation and inspiration in locally relevant ways is what the Chinese consumer cares about. I was talking with Angela a couple of weeks ago. She said they've just done some additional research and they're seeing in the market, Gen-Z loves innovation and inspiration. And that's what we're delivering it. Our cool -- NIKE's brand is the #1 cool brand. It's increased its strength in Beijing over the past year, I think driven by Chinese New Year and Beijing Olympics. NIKE Digital landed the quarter with growth, so our direct connections with consumers. And as Matt mentioned, we're going to digital -- local digital apps in the coming 6 months. And then our product, the localized product through our Express Lane continues to drive great energy. I think Matt mentioned, the Pegasus, the Dunk, the G.T. Cut, the basketball shoe, huge heat for that, Air Force Low. So we continue to think that has huge potential, and we're going to continue to invest in that and then ensure that we are building China for China with our tech stack, with our hyper local technology center and ability to link and serve that Chinese consumer. And so we're taking a medium- to long-term view, and we're as confident today as we ever have been. And coming out of this lockdown, we're seeing increased energy from the Chinese consumer. Matthew Friend : Yes. And I just would add, Bob, that we entered the fourth quarter positioned for a strong quarter on building brand momentum in the marketplace. And our fourth quarter results were impacted by COVID-related disruption and lockdowns, impacting over 100 cities and about 60% of our business. As we look at the dynamics in that particular marketplace and the risk of ongoing disruption in the first half of fiscal '23, we decided to prioritize the health of that marketplace. And as we've learned from experience over the years, having a healthy pull marketplace in a monobrand marketplace like Greater China is critical to brand health and long-term growth. And so we made decisions to recalibrate supply and demand in the fourth quarter. And that included reducing our inventory buys at the factories for forward seasons. We took some reserves on our existing inventory, and we also plan for some investment in promotional activity with our partners. Because we expect that as the marketplace reopens, it's going to be more promotional. And so those were the charges and the impacts that we had in the fourth quarter in order to prioritize that inventory health and pull market by the end of Q2. As John said and some of the examples I gave, we continue to see brand strength growing and consumer connection. And we're seeing it in our brand strength results and also in the way the consumer is engaging with our brand. We invested in the brand this quarter again for the third straight quarter, and we're seeing the impact of that on our business. And as lockdowns lifted in specific trade zones, in late April, May and early June, we saw improvement in traffic and strong overall consumer demand. So we're trying to take the decisions -- the right decisions for the marketplace to position us for growth over the long term. And despite the short-term disruptions, we're increasingly confident in our local market strategy and our ability to fuel long-term growth in the China marketplace. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : Just a few on the model click and then a bigger picture question. I guess, just if we could get a sense of SG&A in the first quarter. I think we got it for the year, a little bit of help there. And then I guess it looks like you're guiding to or at the high end of the revenue algorithm for the year despite the caution that you mentioned to us on China in the first part of the year. Maybe just some thought on what parts of the portfolio overgrow those long-term rates you gave us last year in the year just so we can think about that alongside you? And then I guess just a little bit more on your thinking on structural margins in China over the long term. Obviously, you took some actions in the quarter. We see the output here in the margins. But how should we think about those as you move into things like the new ERP system and into a better pull market? Matthew Friend : Sure. I'll go ahead and take that question. Why don't I start by just saying that as we mentioned last quarter, we thought that the variables that were coming together were positioning us for another year of strong growth in fiscal year '23. And it really reflects, Michael, the power of NIKE's portfolio. Inventory supply is normalizing against a healthy pull market across North America, EMEA and APLA. And we've seen 3 consecutive quarters now where consumer demand has significantly exceeded available inventory supply. And so when we look at our brand strength and momentum, our product pipeline against some of the biggest growth opportunities that we have, we think we're well positioned for growth in fiscal year '23. Having said that, we did take a cautious approach to Greater China. And we're doing that because as we look at what disrupted our performance in the fourth quarter and focusing on what we can control, we felt strongly that prioritizing a healthy pull marketplace is the right action for us to take given the ongoing risk that we see in that marketplace. But longer term, we continue to believe that the growth potential that we see in that marketplace is significant. So underlying drivers of growth, we feel quite confident. We continue to closely monitor consumer behavior and we're not seeing any signs of pullback at this point in time. And so we continue to execute the strategy and the plan we have, which is working. As it relates to SG&A, what I would say is just that we're planning for high single digit to low double-digit SG&A growth for the full year. And that's really us continuing on this multiyear investment plan that we have to create the capabilities that we need to be able to serve consumers directly and personally at scale. And that is an operational transformation that is underway, and we're already starting to see proof points of benefit against it. We're working really hard to prioritize our resources to fuel the things that are going to enable long-term growth and shift resources away from places that are legacy ways of operating. But we continue to feel confident that the things that we're investing in are going to be driving -- are driving business benefit, and we're starting to see some of that come to life at the end of this fiscal year and heading into fiscal '23. As far as your last question about structural margins in Greater China, there isn't anything that we see at a point in time that would lead us to not -- to lead us away from the profitability that we've seen. Obviously, this quarter, we took some actions in order to manage our inventory and to be able to carry forward our plans in fiscal '23 and beyond. In the first quarter, we're just anticipating that the marketplace is going to be promotional. And so we've made some adjustments to our plans around markdown rates and partnership with our wholesale partners to ensure that we clear some of the inventory that isn't owned by NIKE, but that's in the marketplace. But beyond that, our focus is on getting to a healthy pull market by the end of the second quarter. And I think as we look longer term, the fundamental drivers that are driving our profitability in the consumer direct acceleration strategy, more direct and more digital is going to fuel profitability expansion in Greater China, too. And our ERP is, frankly, the backbone that's going to enable us to take advantage of those opportunities in a more significant way. Operator : Our next question is from Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein. Aneesha Sherman : So in the past, you've talked about a sizable gross margin benefit from the shift towards the Direct business. And it's been hard to see that this year with a lot of other moving parts. But if you were to strip out the supply chain and the FX and the other moving parts, are you seeing an underlying mix benefit from that move? And should we -- are you still confident that as some of these transitory costs roll off that you're still on track to get to that high 40s gross margin target in a few years? And then another quick question on gross margin is you talked about markdowns normalising. So given the commentary around premiumization of the assortment, higher percent Direct and Digital, I would have expected you to have a lot more control over markdowns and pricing this year than, say, a couple of years ago. So is that a fair assumption that we should expect markdown breadth and depth to settle at a kind of permanently lower rate given the tighter control over the channel that you have now? Matthew Friend : Sure. Well, let me start on the gross margin by talking about what we saw in the fourth quarter, and I think it will help bring some light, maybe it's a broader question. Our gross margins were down 80 basis points in the fourth quarter. And that is really reflective of 2 elements. From an operational perspective, if you look at the growth that we saw at NIKE Direct and the expanding margins that we saw both in NIKE Direct, in NIKE Digital and a higher full price selling mix overall, our gross margins would have expanded over 100 basis points in the fourth quarter. The decision that we took in Greater China, the specific actions that we took in Greater China had a 200 basis point impact on NIKE, Inc.'s Q4 margins. So when we look at the underlying health of our business and the margin expansion that we see attributed to the shifting business mix from wholesale to more direct and more digital, we are seeing it and the financial benefits that come from it in our gross margins. Since the year '20, our gross margins are up over 260 basis points, and that includes in fiscal year '22 a 100 basis point headwind from elevated ocean freight costs. We're paying about 5x the rate that we paid -- we paid pre-pandemic to put product in a container on a boat and move it from Asia to the U.S. So up 260 basis points with 100 basis points of a headwind. As we look ahead to fiscal '23 and our guidance were flat to declining 50 bps, we're planning for mid-single-digit price increases. We're planning for additional expansion from our growing NIKE Direct business and our digital business, which we believe will continue to lead our growth, but that's being offset by another 100 basis points of ocean freight. So if you take '22 and '23 together, it's about a 200 basis point impact on a 2-year basis from paying those higher rates to move product from Asia to our other geographies. And that has a significant impact on where we are today relative to where we would be. We still believe in the high 40s gross margin goal. We believe those costs are transitory in nature, but we expect it's going to take a few years to revert. And so we're planning for that accordingly. On the last part of what you said about markdowns, here's what I say. We've planned for a normalization of full price realization and markdown rates in fiscal '23. For the last year, we've seen full price realization in our -- in 3 of our geographies to be over 70%, whereas our long-term goal is to be at 65% full price realization. As we think about the markdown rates that associated with that, we also saw both in our channel partners and in our own business, a historically low markdown rate because of the lower available supply. We think that, that will start to normalize over this year. And given some of the uncertainties and the risk scenario planning that we've done around our guidance for '23 that's what's helping to drive this wider range that we're providing in our gross margin guidance for '23. As far as the longer-term goes, as I mentioned, we continue to believe in that high 40s number. And we're going to continue -- and it's going to be fueled by this ongoing consumer-led shift to direct into digital. Operator : The next question is from Gaby Carbone with Deutsche Bank. Gabriella Carbone : So if you move into fiscal '23, I just wondered if you could dig into the overall product flows and what you're seeing around lead time? If you're seeing any recent improvement there. Then I was just wondering if you can elaborate on demand and how you feel about the product pipeline moving ahead? You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're expanding it. So I wondering if you can just talk about that. Matthew Friend : John, you want me to go first looking at the product piece? John Donahoe : Sure. Matthew Friend : Okay. Look, we continue to see transit times be elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. It's about 2 weeks longer than where we were. This is specifically in North America. We're about 2 weeks longer in the low 80s days in the fourth quarter relative to where we were in the fourth quarter of last year. And that's obviously a big impact on our in-transit inventory and the flow of goods into the marketplace. Right at the end of the quarter, we did start to see a little bit of improvement vis-\u00e0-vis the boat backlog at the West Coast ports. But at this point in time, given all the variables that we see there, we're not planning for a significant increment in transit times in fiscal '23. So we're managing our inventory accordingly. We're making decisions about our assortment, product life cycles. We're taking some of our styles to seasonless that we can manage it on more of a rolling basis. And we'll continue to leverage the experience that we've had over the last 2 years, navigating through this environment from a supply chain complexity and congestion perspective. John Donahoe : And Gaby, on product pipeline, it's funny you asked that. We had about 2 weeks ago, our first in-person VP meeting in 2 years. And because we haven't been to in-person, and now when had seen physical product, we had 6 different rooms and built out on the new Serena Williams Building that had our full innovation pipeline for the next 3 years. NIKE, men's, women's, kids, performance, lifestyle by every sport, a Jordan room, a Converse room. And I will tell you, everyone walked out excited by the breadth and depth of the innovation pipeline. It was almost overwhelming to be honest, when you see it all in one place. And so you saw some recent examples of the Spark Flyknit, which is -- what's really interesting about that is more and more of our innovations are done for her, but can be leveraged by all. The ZoomX foam, which is one of our most responsive ones yet that's been pulled throughout the entire running line. I mentioned Formula 23, Next Nature and the sustainability innovations. And so going forward, we're very excited. I teased a little bit about the apparel innovation coming. We think that's going to be a platform opportunity for us, more to come on that in the fall. The pipeline -- Matt mentioned this next coming year of global football with EURO Champ Women's this summer, World Cup in the Men's in the fall, Women's World Cup next year. The remarkable innovation, both performance and lifestyle around global football, a sharper focus on running the Jordan stuff, both footwear and apparel, performance and lifestyle. The Converse room was like a hit because I think most people don't really get to see the full breadth and depth of Converse innovation. So we feel very excited about the innovation pipeline. I will also tell you that our teams, now they're back together in person, feel like the pace and level of innovation is just going to -- and design is going to just accelerate. So a lot of optimism on the innovation front. Operator : Our final question today is from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Lorraine Hutchinson : Just hoping to get your thoughts on channel mix in the coming years as you think about wholesale versus direct, if there are any big call-outs that you would make? Obviously, you're making the investment in technology. Would you expect that to return wholesale to a faster growth rate? Or do you think the Direct business will continue to lead? John Donahoe : Lorraine, we're going to be guided by the consumer. This is -- you heard me say before, the key to winning in this future is giving the consumers what they want, when they want it, how they want it. And consumers don't think about different channels. They just want a seamless and premium and consistent experience. And so everything we're doing is to offer that to them and to make us indifferent, frankly, about where they transacted. So they'll start their shopping on one of our mobile apps or online. They'll do their product investigation or they're looking. They may go ahead and just buy it in one of our mobile apps or they may go into 1 of our stores who they want to try it on. Or if one of our partner stores is closer to them, they'll go there and try it on. Or if they're in a DICK'S and they see what they want and they don't have it in stock, we can fulfill it through our connected inventory. And so the whole goal is to give the consumers what they want, when they want it, how they want it. And we believe we're building what will be a source of competitive advantage that's grounded and having a direct connection with the consumer a membership program is going to be as strong, whether it's through NIKE Direct, owned and digital and physical or through our partners. And if we achieve that, we then can give the consumer true choice and the actual channel mix will land in its most natural place and will evolve in its most natural place. Matthew Friend : Yes. And I just would add that our wholesale revenue this year was depressed because we had to cut 130 million units of supply because our factories in Vietnam were closed for 12 weeks. And so as you look specifically to '23, NIKE Direct will lead our growth and NIKE Digital will be our fastest-growing channel. But we do expect to see wholesale growth look different, in other words, turn and grow based on available inventory supply flowing back into our geographies. And so we do expect to see wholesale growth in fiscal '23. And I think, as John said long term, this is a consumer-led digital transformation. But I still think that our longer-term vision of NIKE Direct representing approximately 60% of our business and digital -- owned digital representing 40% is a trajectory that we are still on. We're seeing growth in our digital business that's exceeding what's happening in the marketplace. We're watching our own digital traffic and an accelerating level of NIKE app downloads that's driving more consumer engagement against our digital platform, and that is driving growth and shift relative to the broader marketplace. And while we're up about 9 points of business mix versus FY '20, we continue to believe that digital is going to be, as John has said again and again and again, a fuel for growth for us over the next 3 to 5 years. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it over to Mr. Trussell for any closing remarks. Paul Trussell : Yes. Just want to say thank you to everyone for participating in our fourth quarter call. We appreciate you joining, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Take care. John Donahoe : Thank you, everyone. Matthew Friend : Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you very much for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] And I'll now turn the call over to NIKE Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe. John Donahoe : Thank you, Paul, and hello to everyone on today's call. Before we get started, I want to give a special shout out to the greatest of all time, Serena Williams, following her final tournament at the U.S. Open. Serena doesn't like to use the word retired, so I won't either. But on behalf of the entire NIKE family and sports fans around the world, we're going to miss seeing her play. We're thrilled to see what she does next as she continues to serve as an inspiration and everything she does. Serena, on behalf of everyone at NIKE, thank you. Turning to our Q1 performance. Our teams continue to prove their ability to operate through volatility while also staying focused on the long term. For the quarter, our revenue growth was 4% on a reported basis and 10% on a currency-neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in our North America, EMEA and APLA geographies. I'm proud of our results this quarter as our brand momentum, culture of innovation and proven operational playbook delivered yet another quarter of strong revenue growth. Our brand strength continues to give us confidence in sustaining our top line momentum. These results reflect our deep connection to consumers around the world as we keep them in the center of all that we do. Our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy enables us to create value around consumer creation, consumer demand in an entire marketplace fueled by the lifelong relationships we maintain. This significant momentum that we're seeing is fueled by structural tailwinds that continue to create energy for us. NIKE's growth is strengthened quarter-by-quarter by the expanded definition of sport, by the societal movement toward comfort and health and wellness and by the fundamental shift in consumer behavior toward digital. These advantages, along with our scale, the strength of our portfolio of brands and the right strategy, renew our confidence in a more populated competitive landscape. As the world's largest sports apparel and footwear company, we are happy to set the pace in serving the consumer. At NIKE, our focus remains not only to grow market share but also to invest to grow the entire market. Our ability to expand the world of sport and our ability to create the future of sport itself is why I wouldn't trade NIKE's position with anyone. Now as you look at this quarter's strong results, we can see our brand momentum and global portfolio come to life. This is true across the three areas I'd like to walk through today, our brand that deeply connects with consumers fueled by authenticity and sport, our culture of innovation that drives a continuous pipeline of new products, and our competitive advantage across the marketplace as one of the few brands that can connect with and serve consumers at scale. So let's start with NIKE's strong brand and our connection to sport, which differentiates us all over the globe. Consumers continue to rate us their number one cool and number one favorite brand as we connect directly and deeply with consumers worldwide. No matter the macroeconomic dynamics, no matter the competitive landscape, the NIKE brand, and indeed, all three of our brands, including Jordan and Converse, have created meaningful relationships with consumers across age, gender, ethnicity and more. This brand momentum is fueled time and time again by our athletes and teams. No other brand in the world can match our roster as we help them perform at their very best. Just look at women's football this quarter. Two fabulous international tournaments ended with NIKE federations on top with England winning the Euro Champs and Brazil's winner of the Copa America. And what's particularly exciting is that these two wildly popular teams will compete in the inaugural Women's Finalissima, the first-of-a-kind women's match between the European and South American champions. This historic match is slated for February 2023, and we can't wait. And speaking, we can't wait, we're very excited for the Men's World Cup later this year and the Women's World Cup next summer. This will truly be one of the greatest 18 months in footfall history, and NIKE will be there in full force. Now our brand strength and consumer connection will continue to be driven by storytelling through sport in a way that only NIKE can. In tennis, I mentioned Serena's farewell to the sport at the U.S. Open, but the new generation made some noise there too. Carlos Alcaraz won the men's side at 19 years old become the youngest men's number one ever. Along with Frances Tiafoe and Jannik Sinner, the future of men's tennis was on full display, with NIKE proud to represent this next generation of exciting players. Also in the quarter, the Las Vegas Aces won the WNBA title, led by Coach of the Year Becky Hammon, Kelsey Plum and League MVP A'ja Wilson. And American football is now back. With the Swoosh won by all 32 NFL teams, and NIKE and Jordan representing 21 schools and college football top 25. And finally, in the Berlin Marathon last week, Eliud Kipchoge smashed his own world record, running the marathon in an incredible two hours, one minute and nine seconds while wearing the Alphafly Next% 2. Simply put, we have a roster of athletes, teams, leagues and federations that represents the very best in sport, creating inspiration for consumers worldwide. Let's move to innovation. As we've said before, NIKE's relentless pipeline of innovative product continues to create separation between us and our competition. Today, we have incredible momentum in key products and franchises across the spectrum of lifestyle and performance. And what excites us even more is the energy and anticipation we're feeling for the innovative product that's next in the pipeline. We're now starting to see the product that reflects our shift two years ago to our new consumer construct of men's, women's and kids, and the impact it's had is remarkable. We're also excited about how we'll be connecting this product to the consumer. Today, we're working toward being more seasonally relevant across the full assortment. So the energy we're creating from an innovation standpoint, when combined with how we plan to story-tell and connect it to the marketplace gives us immense confidence as we look ahead. Earlier, I mentioned this landmark 18 months for global football we've got coming up. We created a football boot to match the moment. So during the women's Euro Champs this past summer, we debuted the Air Zoom Mercurial, which for the first time, adds a Zoom airbag to what was already our fastest football boot. This gives the footballer an even greater sense of snappy propulsive energy return. The new Mercurial and energy around it is NIKE at its best, as products, storytelling the marketplace and elite athletes come together to connect this innovation to consumers. And with our best boot ready for the biggest stages of the world's most popular game, not to mention a full lineup of Federation kits, we're thrilled about translating this energy into commercial opportunity. Our culture of innovation is fueled not just by what we make but also how we make it. We're always looking to increase the pace and precision of product creation. New VR design software and simulation tools allow our designers and engineers to collaborate in real time like never before. This transformative path to continuous new innovation is highlighted by the new Air Max Scorpion. The Scorpion, which is an eye-catching shoe that offers our most Air ever in terms of pounds per square inch, followed a development time line of just 18 months. In fact, our digital transformation investments directly led to Scorpion's breakthrough innovation within our iconic Air franchise. How did that happen? Well, thanks to computational design pioneered by NIKE for industrial design uses, Scorpion introduces a radical new system for airbags, moving from simple forms into complex new geometries for a unique underfoot sensation that has to be felt to be believed. And moving forward, we plan to accelerate the use of our industry-leading digital creation tools to bring new excitement to our biggest franchises. Now during last quarter's call, I mentioned a new platform that we believe has the potential to change the apparel industry. As some of you have seen with its launch last week, I'm talking about NIKE Forward, our biggest apparel innovation since Dri-FIT 30 years ago. NIKE Forward revolutionizes apparel creation to make premium sustainably-minded product that offers brand-new comfortable sensation. The truth is NIKE Forward feels different because it is different. Forward's being introduced in hoodies and crewnecks for men and women that feature raw cut pockets, minimal seams and a modern silhouette. And this innovative product is warm and yet lightweight with a future-forward look that consumers have responded to since its unveiling last week. And as the consumer focus on comfort continues to gain momentum, we see vast opportunity ahead for scaling forward in our entire performance-driven sportswear apparel business. So from performance to sportswear sustainability, NIKE has always married the art and science of product creation as we use innovation and design to connect with and inspire consumers all over the globe. My third and final point today is our competitive advantage across the marketplace. We're continuing to accelerate against our One Nike Marketplace approach in which we directly connect with the consumer no matter where they shop and with each channel playing an integrated role in the consumer's overall journey. Now our approach starts with NIKE Digital as that's where most consumers begin their shopping journeys. And then it's augmented by our strategic wholesale partners who share our vision to provide a consistent premium and seamless consumer experience. And last but not least, our remodel brand stores which continue to play the key role of supplementing where there are gaps in the marketplace, such as women's or Jordan. Now this quarter, we delivered NIKE Digital's highest net revenue quarter ever. We see consumers continuing to vote for NIKE Digital as the NIKE commerce app had its highest traffic in history during Q1. And we keep elevating our ability to serve these consumers. For example, new membership tools we put in place last year in fiscal '22 that went live in Q1 create one-to-one connections at scale by delivering personalized consumer journeys and experiences which in turn drive first purchases and increased loyalty. And the SNKRS app continues to fuel energy to our growing audience of high-value members. We're bringing this community in almost daily flow of compelling content and product launches. In Q1, for example, SNKRS saw its most member entries ever for the Travis Scott AJ1 that dropped in July with a record 3.8 million member entries for just a single shoe, SNKRS continues to impress as it offers the perfect intersection of content, community and commerce. Second, our partners are and will remain a vitally important part of our marketplace strategy. Partners enable us to serve consumers with expanded access, choice and convenience, and above all, letting us know and serve these consumers across the full marketplace. Today, we're seeing growth through our partners and improved retail sales. For example, back-to-school was strong as supply continued to improve and traffic and sell-through continued to accelerate. And as we continue to focus on giving consumers personalized experiences regardless of channel, the key remains connected membership. This model gives shopper the benefits of NIKE membership in partner stores, accelerating in-store conversion, engagement and improving customer lifetime value. Now as you know, connected membership again last year with DICK'S Sporting Goods before two of our key partners in Greater China joined in, TopSport and Pou Sheng. And today, we're very excited to announce that we're now extending connected membership to EMEA with Zalando and JD Sports as increased opportunities for connected data and inventory make us even quicker and more precise in jointly serving the consumer. In fact, just two days ago, we hosted our first in-person, NIKE Partner Summit in over two years in which we brought to Beaverton, a group of 24 of our top retail partners, representing 76 countries. The summit was a great opportunity for us to accelerate into the future together with a unified vision and belief in partnership and collaboration. And it was clear that our partners were excited to get the sneak peek at our upcoming product as well as getting a deeper dive in our strategy. NIKE will continue investing to deliver the very best brand in the industry to elevate our collective game with the right product experiences and unmatched storytelling through content and insights to help us win with the consumer. These strategic partnerships are truly win-win with plenty of opportunities still ahead. And finally in our marketplace strategy, we continue to build a compelling retail footprint with our own brick-and-mortar fleet. As Direct becomes an even bigger part of our business, we're investing in becoming a better retailer as we pursue our goal of becoming world-class in this space. In a dynamic retail environment, our global traffic is up, thanks in part to the unique NIKE experiences we offer across our assortment of retail concepts. For instance, in July, we opened our first NIKE Rise store in EMEA, NIKE West London, following the success of NIKE Rise in China and Korea. All three NIKE Rise stores use real-time shopping insight and the community focus to deliver tailored in-store experiences for consumers. NIKE West London uses local sports, like football and running, along with data on the city and its athletes to create something that cannot be replicated anywhere else. In the end, our strong brand momentum speaks to our continued belief that these are times when strong brands get stronger. We're supercharging how we serve consumers with innovation, direct connection and experiences that create lifelong relationships with our brands. There's never been a better time to be in the sport and wellness business, and I'm confident in our ability to not just stay at the front of the path but also to extend and expand our lead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Matthew Friend : Thanks, John, and hello to everyone on the call. Our first quarter of fiscal '23 demonstrated again the deep consumer connection and strong demand for NIKE, Jordan and Converse. In a dynamic operating environment, we delivered top line results ahead of plan, more than offsetting foreign exchange headwinds. With industry-leading Digital growth, positive retail traffic in our stores and online, and more product available for consumers across the marketplace, the power of NIKE's portfolio continues to fuel business momentum. At our core, NIKE is a growth company, built on a passion for serving athletes. 50 years later, this passion inspires consumers worldwide through our commitment to product innovation and our belief that sport can change the world. Today, NIKE's potential for growth has no limits as we create our future through a steadfast focus on serving the consumer. At the same time, we are closely monitoring an operating environment that continues to be disruptive. So before discussing our first quarter financial results, let me provide a deeper view into the latest shifts we are seeing and the actions we are taking to manage our business for the long term. Over the past three years, we have leveraged our operational playbook to manage through supply chain disruption and COVID-related store closures. I could not be more proud of how our team continues to adapt to changing circumstances with a relentless focus on getting the right product to the right place at the right time. This quarter, it became clear to us that conditions in North America are shifting once again. Earlier ordering by retailers, driven by strong consumer demand and less predictable delivery time lines, had led to elevated inventory levels broadly across consumer goods. Then transit times began to rapidly improve with signals that further improvement may be coming. At the same time, consumers are facing greater economic uncertainty, and promotional activity across the marketplace is accelerating, especially in apparel. As a result, we faced a new degree of complexity. Demand for NIKE, Jordan and Converse continues to be uniquely strong with positive consumer response and high full price realization on fresh seasonal assortments and key product franchises. In September, month-to-date retail sales are up double digits versus the prior year, following a strong back-to-school season. However, our North America inventory grew 65% versus the prior year, with in-transit inventory growing approximately 85%. This reflects the combination of late delivery for the past two seasons plus early holiday orders that are now set to arrive earlier than planned and a prior year that was impacted by factory closures in Vietnam and Indonesia. As a result, we are taking decisive action to clear excess inventory, focusing on specific pockets of seasonally late products, predominantly in apparel. While we expect this to have a transitory impact on gross margins this fiscal year, we believe this cost will be far outweighed by the benefit of clearing marketplace capacity to align seasonally relevant product, storytelling and retail experiences for the consumer. Time and again, this is how NIKE responds to adversity. We adapt, we compete and we accelerate forward. With strong brand momentum, improving deliveries and a robust innovation pipeline, we're acting now to set the stage for future seasons of sustainable profitable growth. Looking ahead, we are especially excited about the breadth and depth of our product pipeline. This includes innovation platforms that break new ground in performance and sustainability. Women's apparel completely redesigned for fit, sensation and support. A renewed focus on serving everyday runners with the world's best running innovation across price points. A total refresh of our signature basketball line across brands. New sportswear collaborations with the leaders of youth culture and the next chapters of our most iconic product franchises. NIKE's authenticity as the champion for athletes and sport has always been one of our greatest strengths. Over the next 18 months, we'll drive consumer energy through new product and storytelling, in essence, doing what NIKE does best. NIKE's competitive advantages are also growing as the Consumer Direct Acceleration transforms our operating model, driving deeper and more direct connections through digital. NIKE membership serves as a catalyst for digital growth, driving greater engagement and higher lifetime value in our highest margin channel. This quarter, repeat buying members grew by over 30% with increased buying frequency and demand across total NIKE members. In fact, many of our most important membership benchmarks, reflecting how well we convert, engage and retain buying members, are at near all-time highs. These trends give us confidence that we have a strong and loyal member foundation to drive digital growth ahead. Since fiscal '19, our Digital business has nearly tripled to exceed $10 billion in revenue, representing 24% of total NIKE Brand revenue in fiscal '22. Over this period, NIKE Direct gross margins expanded through the combination of rapid digital growth and improvements in channel margin profitability, ultimately fueling NIKE's overall gross margin expansion despite being partially offset by transitory headwinds experienced through the pandemic. While we continue to manage through short-term dynamics, these structural tailwinds give us confidence that we are making progress towards our long-term financial goals. Now let me turn to our NIKE, Inc. first quarter financial results. In Q1, NIKE Inc. revenue grew 4% and 10% on a currency-neutral basis. This was led by 14% growth in NIKE Direct and 8% growth in wholesale. NIKE Digital grew 23% with double-digit growth across EMEA, North America and APLA, fueled by increasing traffic, higher conversion and growth in average order value. First quarter reported gross margin declined 220 basis points to 44.3%. This was primarily due to elevated freight and logistics costs plus higher markdowns across the marketplace in North America and unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates. SG&A grew 10% in Q1, primarily due to wage-related expenses, strategic technology investments, increased NIKE Direct costs and increased demand creation expenses. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.7% compared to 11% for the same period last year, primarily due to decreased benefits from stock-based compensation. First quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.93. Finally, inventories were $9.7 billion, up 44% compared to the prior year. Driven by volatility in transit times in North America, strategic decisions to buy inventory for future seasons earlier and lower inventory levels due to last year's factory closures in Vietnam and Indonesia. Now let's review the operating segments. In North America, Q1 revenue grew 13% and EBIT declined 4%. NIKE Direct grew 13% versus the prior year, outpacing the broader market with double-digit in-store and digital traffic growth. NIKE Digital grew 19%, fueled by member demand and the NIKE app. Wholesale revenue grew low double digits with strong growth from strategic partners such as DICK'S and JD Finish Line as well as our authenticated partners. NIKE continues to lead as the number 1 cool and number one favorite brand in North America. We're driving momentum across key consumer and sport dimensions, including positive consumer response to the Pegasus 39, Invincible 2 and Infinity 3 in performance running; high sell-through and full price realization across key footwear franchises, such as Air Force 1, Dunk and the Air Max 270 and broad-based growth across men's, women's, kids and Jordan on improved inventory supply. As I previously discussed, we started to increase promotional activity in the first quarter and expect the broader marketplace to be promotional at least through the end of the calendar year. We expect that total inventory in North America peaked in Q1, and we anticipate seeing sequential improvement over the year as we rebalance supply and continue serving strong consumer demand. As we prioritize a healthy pull market, we are confident that our brand strength and decisive actions positions us well to compete and to capture market share. In EMEA, we saw record results. Q1 revenue grew 17% on a currency-neutral basis. EBIT grew 11% on a reported basis, with broad-based growth and strong gross margin expansion driving the most profitable quarter in EMEA history despite significant foreign exchange headwinds. NIKE Direct grew 20% on a currency-neutral basis and NIKE Digital grew 46%. Running delivered solid growth with strong consumer response to the Pegasus 39, Invincible 2 and the Peg Trail 4. We also celebrated our most successful Mercurial launch ever and an unforgettable moment for women's sport at the European Championships, with our Never Settle, Never Done campaign driving over 450 million impressions. Since fiscal '19, EMEA gross margins have expanded by more than 500 basis points, with NIKE Digital increasing its penetration from 7% to 20%, nearly tripling its share of EMEA NIKE Brand revenue. This is another great proof point for how our consumer-led digital transformation is accelerating NIKE's growth and profitability. Next, I'll provide some color around our results in Greater China. In Q1, revenue declined 13% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT declined 23% on a reported basis. NIKE Direct declined 2% on a currency-neutral basis with a 5% decline in NIKE Digital. While COVID-related disruption had meaningful impact on store operations and retail traffic, business performance and inventory management are ahead of plan as we continue to proactively recalibrate supply and demand. Brand strength is our competitive advantage, with NIKE setting the pace as Chinese consumers' number one and number one favorite brand, further extending our lead among teams. Product innovation remains a key differentiator with strong sell-through from the Alphafly Next% 2, the Pegasus 39, the G.T. Cut 2 and other performance products. Jordan Brand's momentum was another highlight with year-over-year growth, driven by a standout Luka 1 launch, key franchise strength and the energy of Jordan's 25th anniversary campaign. We continue to deepen connections with Chinese consumers in locally relevant ways, from elevating the street dance community with hyperlocal product and storytelling to igniting youth basketball culture through the lens of the Chinese high school basketball league. With Gen Z member demand growing more than 25% versus last year on NIKE's digital platforms and the newly launched localized NIKE app already leading as the number one brand shopping app, we're more encouraged than ever about NIKE's opportunity to serve Chinese consumers with distinct, premium and localized experiences. As mentioned last quarter, we are taking a cautious near-term approach in Greater China, given the ongoing risks of COVID-related disruption. However, our brand and business momentum gives us increasing confidence that NIKE's unique value proposition will fuel long-term growth in Greater China. As we turn to APLA, Q1 revenue grew 16% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT grew 4% on a reported basis. We delivered our third consecutive quarter of double-digit currency-neutral growth led by Southeast Asia and India and Korea. NIKE Direct grew 30% on a currency-neutral basis, led by 29% growth in NIKE Digital and 31% growth from NIKE-owned stores. Our Member Days offense continues to accelerate member engagement, tripling repeat buying versus the prior year. Women's continues to deliver outsized growth, with momentum in performance running, footwear, bras and sports style innovation footwear like Air Max. Performance fueled strong growth in men's with the launch of Pegasus, Infinity and Invincible in running and the Mercurial in global football. In addition, we have now transitioned our businesses in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay to a distributor model. Now I'll turn to our updated financial outlook for fiscal '23. To date, we continue to see strong consumer demand for our portfolio of brands across our geographies. We are closely monitoring consumer confidence and behavior, and ultimately, the implications of high inflation on consumer demand. We've managed through cycles like this before, and we know these are times to stay on the offense, leveraging our financial strength to prioritize a quicker return to a healthy pull market. In this environment, strong brands set the pace and we are confident NIKE will emerge even stronger. We are focused on what we can control as we take a measured approach against an uncertain macro outlook. Accordingly, we will tighten up our second half buys and liquidate excess inventory more aggressively beginning in the second quarter, focusing the flow of new product to our strategic partners and NIKE Direct. Headwinds from foreign exchange have also shifted significantly in the last 90 days as the trend of U.S. dollar strengthening has accelerated. Based on current spot rates, net of hedging activity, we estimate the full year negative impact of foreign exchange on reported revenue and EBIT to now be approximately $4 billion and $900 million, respectively, creating a wide divergence in constant versus real dollar performance. We continue to expect currency-neutral revenue growth of low double digits versus the prior year, equating to reported revenue growth of low to mid-single digits versus the prior year, assuming 800 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. We now expect gross margin to decline between 200 to 250 basis points versus the prior year. This reflects approximately 150 basis points of annual impact from higher markdowns and higher off-price mix to liquidate elevated inventory, a second straight year of more than 100 basis points of headwinds from elevated freight and logistics costs, and foreign exchange pressure now a 70 basis point headwind on the full year. We now expect SG&A to increase high single digits as we prioritize investment in new transformational capabilities to serve consumers directly and at scale, partially offset by tighter expense control and limited headcount growth across the business. We now expect the fiscal '23 effective tax rate to be in the mid- to high teens range, primarily due to decreased benefits from stock-based compensation. For the second quarter specifically, we expect reported revenue to grow low double digits on strong consumer demand despite 900 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. We expect second quarter gross margins to decline approximately 350 to 400 basis points versus the prior year, the largest impact across the fiscal year as we discount out-of-season product more aggressively in a largely promotional marketplace. This will require higher markdowns in our own channels and through wholesale partners. The second quarter also compares to last year's record level of full price realization and includes headwinds from freight, logistics and other supply chain costs as well as foreign exchange. As we look towards the rest of our fiscal year, we are confident in our strategy and in our opportunity ahead. While we expect circumstances to remain dynamic, we are optimistic as we continue to make progress towards our long-term financial goals. Our brand momentum is strong. The power of our portfolio is unrivaled, and our vision of NIKE's limitless potential is clear. On that note, I'd like to close by thanking our 79,000 NIKE, Jordan and Converse teammates around the world who serve our mission with a passion for sport and a culture of innovation unlike any other. They represent our true competitive advantage and our greatest reason for confidence as we create NIKE's future. With that, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Your line is open. Robert Drbul : Hi, good evening. A couple of questions. The first one is when you look at the inventory situation, and I guess specifically in North America, when do you think you will have recalibrated the supply/demand for NIKE? And I guess just wondering if - what you think about the industry when you think the industry might also sort of be better in balance on the supply-demand equation. Thanks. Matthew Friend : Sure, Bob. Well, as I mentioned on the call, our inventory grew 44% this quarter, which was led by 65% growth in North America. And maybe just as a point of context because you're right, it is North America where we're focused, where we saw the most significant - where we've seen the most significant volatility and disruption in the supply chain. In Greater China, as an example, our inventory was down 3% versus the prior year, and we feel quite confident about our inventory levels in EMEA and APLA. In North America in particular, we saw in-transit growth of 85%, and in-transit inventory now represents approximately 65%, so almost two-thirds of North America's total inventory. And that's really being driven by a couple of factors. The first one is the disruption that started over a year ago when our factories closed for almost 15 weeks in Vietnam, and for a lesser extent in Indonesia, and the decisions that were taken after that with regards to inventory that was in process to be made. Secondly, we've seen quite a bit of volatility in transit times. We saw an increase in the second half of last year. And then most recently, this quarter, we saw a significant improvement in transit times after we and many others had made the strategic decision to buy the holiday season earlier because of the longer transit times. So when we look at our overall inventory, we think that there's about 10% of the inventory that we're focused on in terms of trying to drive more accelerated liquidation. And while our inventory was high at the end of the first quarter, we do expect to see sequential improvement in inventory balances from here over the next three quarters. We plan to compete, as I mentioned, in a more promotional environment. And given the macro uncertainty that's out there for the consumer, we're taking a more measured approach and we're tightening our inventory buys around the world based on some of the risks that could materialize in the second half. But we're confident that the actions that we're taking, which we started a bit in the first quarter and now we're more aggressively accelerating in the second quarter, are going to position us and our strategic partners very well for fiscal '24. John Donahoe : And Bob, I'd add on to the second, just part of your question around - you're right, it's the entire industry. And so we're entering the next 90 days and the remainder of this fiscal year with the same mindset we've had in the last 2.5 years, which is through whatever period of turbulence we've got, we want to leverage our strengths to emerge in a stronger position than our competition at the other end of it. And so in a promotional environment, brand strength matters. And so we will be aggressive, as Matt said, on liquidating excess inventory but also coming hard with our key popular franchises to bring heat and energy to them in Q just like we did in Q1, like the Travis Scott AJ1, and that had very strong full price realization. And we got a very strong innovation pipeline that will still be coming hard and hard in Q2, Q3 and Q4. You saw in Q1, we had the Air Zoom Mercurial. We had the Air Max Scorpion, NIKE Forward. We've got a really strong innovation pipeline. So we talk about the transitional and the structural. The transitional is navigating through the inventory situation. The structural is leveraging our competitive advantages so we emerge in a stronger position, and we'll be playing offense on both. Robert Drbul : Great. Thank you very much. Good luck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Matthew Boss : Great. Thanks. So maybe John, to that point, could you speak to the inflection in demand that you've seen in North America? What have you seen in early fall with full price selling? Does any of this change your pipeline of innovation? And how will you balance this pipeline looking forward of newness and technical innovation while, at the same time, taking the aggressive inventory actions that you've outlined? John Donahoe : Well, Matthew, it's just as Matt said earlier. So we see strong consumer demand in North America currently, right? There's no signs of any softness. It was relatively promotional in August but strong, strong into the first couple of weeks of this quarter. And so we, again, talk in terms of transitional and structural. On a transitional basis, as Matt said, we're going to work through the excess inventory to get to a full marketplace as fast as we can and try to do it in an intelligent way to take share. And as my predecessors used to say, through a few competitive elbows along the way. And then our innovation agenda is still going to continue full speed ahead. And consumers are responding to innovation and compelling storytelling. And that's been true. That's true in Running. That's true with the Peg 39 and the innovations coming and our Running line are excellent over the next year. We're very excited about Pegasus, Invincible, Infinity, the entire, what we call the Must-Win 6. We have a great basketball portfolio coming. You've seen the LeBron 20, right, launched, already hard to get, if not sold out. And LeBron 20 and what's beginning a real refresh of our entire basketball signature line, both in NIKE and Jordan. We've got, in women's fitness, we got a very strong Alate bra is out with very good early consumer response and our entire tights line will be coming in and full bra line in this coming fiscal year. And then Air Max Scorpion was the starting point in the lifestyle basis, we have a strong Air Max pipeline over the next six to 12 months. And so we're going to be going full speed ahead on those with strong and compelling storytelling. And it's kind of a balance. We think those are the structural things that set us up to gain long-term share while we're navigating through the short-term, short-term industry-wide excess inventory. Matthew Friend : I might just add, Matt, that when we look at our performance in Q1 and then to date in September, we're seeing double-digit growth in retail sales. And we're bringing what we call fresh assortments, so new product into market. We are seeing strong consumer demand, strong average weekly sell-through and high full price realization. And I think the distinction here that we're trying to make is a distinction between footwear strength and seasonally appropriate product and innovation and late-arriving apparel that has been impacted from the factory closures a year ago, and some of the decisions made around what to continue to make and bring to market and then what's been impacted by transit times. And so we're really focused on trying to clear through that late off-season apparel inventory that we have predominantly in North America, but we do have a little bit of it in EMEA and APLA as well. We continue to see strong month-to-date sales in EMEA and APLA as well. So our brand momentum is pretty clear around the world, and we continue to be encouraged as we see the way the consumer is responding to a greater availability of supply than we've been able to have over the past year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Your line is open. Paul Lejuez : Thanks. Curious how you're thinking about the international markets. Curious what your - curious what the promotional levels look like in those markets. And how do you think about balancing the sales gross margin of closing? More likely to go for market share in the international markets versus the margin? If you can maybe share your thinking on international, anything outside of North America. Thanks. John Donahoe : Maybe Matt, I'll just make one comment and then - you're going to hear a key theme over and over to - our highest priority is building our long-term competitive position. And that's what we've been doing. So whether that's in China coming out, we are very enthusiastic about the signs we're seeing in China and coming with a full wave of innovation and storytelling and hyper-localized innovation and storytelling, we think, will serve us well in China. As Matt mentioned, EMEA and APLA, strong consumer demand with a strong pipeline. So our ultimate goal, the way we're prioritizing is what's going to enable us to improve our competitive position and build that deeper relationship with consumers that, with a direct connection, surrounded by membership that allows us to have a lifetime relationship with those consumers. And then, Matt, you can comment on some of the details. Matthew Friend : Yes. I'll just give you a couple of specifics in a couple of geographies, Paul. In EMEA, as I mentioned, we saw significant gross margin expansion again this quarter and a very high level of full price realization. And so our performance and our approach in that marketplace has been one that's driving growth and profitability. And that strength has been true across channels, so in our own channels but across the wholesale channel as well. When we look at Greater China as an example, where we know that the marketplace has been more promotional because of what's transpired with regards to the COVID-related disruption that everybody is facing in that marketplace, we overdelivered our plan in Q1. And that wasn't just in our financial results. We saw stronger retail sales across the marketplace than we had planned. We were able to liquidate more units than we planned, and we saw a higher full price realization in Greater China than we had planned. And as a result of that, we're increasingly confident that our inventory will be normalized by the end of this coming quarter and in a position to compete on a full-price basis. The last thing I would probably just say, and I sort of alluded to it in my prepared remarks, but NIKE is at its best when we are able to bring together product, storytelling and a retail experience for the consumer. And when you look at the depth and breadth of our product portfolio and the way that we dimensionalize our products for the consumer, it's a competitive advantage for us that makes our brands stand apart relative to others. When we think about the way we're going to navigate the excess supply and liquidation relative to the way that we're trying to maintain a full-price marketplace for the new inventory that's flowing in, we're prioritizing the flow of new products to our strategic partners and to NIKE Direct. And so we'll use our factory stores. We'll use digital a little bit in order to liquidate some of this excess apparel, and we'll use other partners in wholesale to liquidate it. But we will - we are focused on ensuring that the holiday product at the starting season that's arriving on time is going to be set in the marketplace in our strategic partners so that we can put our best foot forward with the consumer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Alex Straton : Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to just hit on macro fears, which are obviously top of mind for investors right now, particularly as it relates to potential recession. Can you just talk about what your guidance assumes as it relates to any potential recession? And can you just remind us how NIKE has performed in previous periods of economic pressure as well as if you've seen any signs of trade down so far within the business? Thank you. John Donahoe : Yes, Alex, we again will repeat some consistent things. We're coming off a strong quarter and we feel very good about our competitive position, and we have not yet seen any signs of slowdown. That said, we don't have any crystal ball around the external factors, whether it's FX, whether it's inflation, whether it's the impact of energy prices on consumer spending. And so Matt will talk a little bit about the assumptions we have built in to our second half. But what we're focused on is what we can control, which is staying on the offense. And we believe that we can meet consumer demand regardless of the macro demand, meet consumers and gain share through this period. And so whether that's in a promotional environment in North America in the next six to 12 months, or that's in EMEA, APLA, in China, as we discussed, we feel like we can have better price realization and use our strong brand strength and product innovation to gain share during this period. Matthew Friend : Yes. And I just would add specific to the guidance that, as John mentioned, in the first quarter, we exceeded our own internal plan with double-digit currency-neutral growth. My guidance for second quarter was continuing to see strong consumer demand with reported revenue growth growing low double digits and 900 basis points of foreign exchange. And given where we sit today, we're confident in the next - the plan we have for the next 90 days and the way that the consumer is responding. We're closely monitoring consumer confidence. And to give you an example, we've seen double-digit growth in retail sales in EMEA in Q1 and in - sorry, not in Q1, in September season to date. But we're seeing some softness in the U.K., and it's being more than offset by strength across the rest of the EMEA portfolio, in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, et cetera. And so we're taking a measured approach to the second half. And that specifically relates to the way we're planning inventory. For us, the decisions we take and the commitments we make to inventory end up mattering most in the context of the way that we look at the Forward plan. And our full year forecast of low double-digit currency-neutral growth, given our performance in Q1 and what we anticipate for quarter two, is reflecting a more modest growth rate in the second half. And that's us taking a measured approach. At the end of the day, like John said, we're going to focus on the consumer and leverage the operational playbook that we have. There are some very specific things we're doing with regards to excess inventory in North America. But we're going to keep our - keep focused on the consumer. And we're confident that to the extent that something more significant happens, we're taking some of the right actions now in order to position us well in that scenario. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Nagel : Hi, good evening. Thank you for taking my questions. So a couple of questions. First off, with regard to China. Is there something you can point us to, to maybe help us understand better or help us frame better the underlying demand - the underlying healthy demand in that market? The reason I ask, you talked about it qualitatively. We see that numbers are still be there but that's been primarily a function of the ongoing COVID disruption. So is there something more quantitative that we can see that really help us understand the underlying demand? And then the second question I have, with - I know there's been a lot of questions on inventory already. But as you think about this sort of say, pocket of excess inventory that's now in the system, is it simply just delayed? Or is there something else that makes - - that encourages you to want to clear it as opposed to just work it through over the normal course of time at full price? Thank you. John Donahoe : So Brian, [indiscernible], Matt, I'll take the first and you take second? Thanks, Brian, for the question. On China, as you know, we've got a very strong local team there, led by Angela Dong, and they're doing a remarkable job navigating through this dynamic situation with the temporary COVID closures. And our hope is that, that gets better over time. So that's - but that's a factor that - it's a little like inflation. We can't completely predict it. And the great news is our team there is showing great agility navigating through, again, what we're calling a transitional environment. But structurally, we see some very encouraging signs of consumers. In fact, I was talking to Angela last night. And she's very clear that they're seeing Chinese consumers are emerging from these lockdowns with a real hunger for innovation, quality and energized storytelling. And that's particularly around sport, that's what - that's we do best. And so they're responding to our strong flow of global innovative product. G.T. Cut sold out, as Matt mentioned. Alphafly Next% sold out. But even more what they're responding to is when they take a global innovation and hyper-localize it. So the Peg 39, a hyper-localized into a gel design. Our dance pack, they hyper-localized. And as a result, they're having the lowest markdowns in the industry. And we're building a hyper local-brand voice there. The NIKE mobile app and SNKRS are now fully localized, which allows us to both in live streaming and other ways, deliver a very localized consumer journey and consumer experience. And Matt mentioned some of the storytelling in his remarks around the Jordan 25th anniversary and what we're doing with high school basketball that it is connecting with consumers. And so we continue to be the number one cool and favorite brand. And that is - we are strengthening with young consumers and Gen Z consumers on that. And so I don't know if there's quantitative. What is clear is that the Chinese consumer is ready to come back into the market, and what they're looking for is innovation, quality and storytelling. And we feel that plays well to our positioning into our opportunity. So we're optimistic. Matthew Friend : Yes. And I would just say - I would add that when we referenced that China grew ahead of our plan, 13% decline was better than we were anticipating in light of the fact that our team was planning for disruption, given the episodic closures by city that are occurring. Now given the performance that we saw in the quarter, we saw retail sales across the overall marketplace increase relative to our plan aligned with that. And what I would say, Brian, is that this encouragement that we've been noticing for the past three quarters is really giving us confidence from across the marketplace that while we've been navigating through some near-term issues, that NIKE is positioned to grow in Greater China. And the fact that we're moving quickly to move through an inventory will be a competitive advantage for us in that marketplace, and we're ready to compete beginning next quarter. And so we've got a great team, as John mentioned, and we think that we're toes-on-the-line ready to serve the consumer in the ways that we've talked about. I think on your second question on pockets of excess inventory, I think that was a more broad question. That wasn't for China. What I would basically tell you is this. Because we had late product arriving for the spring, summer and fall seasons, because of the disruption that we've seen in North America and then the decisions of early order holiday and to have that arrive earlier, we effectively have a few seasons landing in the marketplace at the same time. Because we have a portion of that inventory being seasonally out of relevance, we've decided to take that inventory and more aggressively liquidate it so that we can put the newest and best inventory in front of the consumer in the right locations. So that's where we're focused. It's predominantly apparel. It's in North America predominantly. And that's where our focus and attention is. And when we look at our full year guidance, it's a 150 basis point annual impact, which we believe is transitory. In other words, we will incur it this year in order to be able to move that inventory through. And then we've got a foundation for growth and expanded profitability in fiscal '24 pursuing a full-price innovation - sorry, full-price realization against our new product and innovation pipeline. Paul Trussell : We have time for one last question. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Michael Binetti : Hi guys. Thanks for taking our questions here. Matt, I was just wondering if you - to clarify one simple thing, you said North America inventory peaked in first quarter. Could you clarify that the total company inventory starts to decline on a year-over-year basis after this? Maybe some of the visibility you have into the back half related to how you're building it after your comment that 2Q will be the low watermark on gross margins. And then, John, I know it's a very different macro but the comments you guys just made for fiscal '24 and beyond. Any reflection on the five-year targets that you gave us a year ago, some of the growth rates and year-over-year margin opportunities as we get past this year relative to that plan? Thanks. Matthew Friend : Well, as it relates to inventory, Michael, the answer - you don't usually get a yes or no question, but the answer to your first question is yes. We do expect total inventory to improve as we go from the first quarter. So I highlighted North America because that's obviously the geography where we've seen this most significant increase. But we do expect to see it reduce. And then as it relates to - reduce on a dollar basis. And then as it relates to the margin impact, the second quarter will be the largest impact. We do expect that there will be some residual liquidation that takes place in the third quarter. And like I said just before, the total annual impact we see as a transitory 150 basis point cost to effectively liquidate the inventory that we want to liquidate and serve the marketplace with the fresh holiday product and then looking forward that we see. John Donahoe : And Mike, on the second part of your question, it's - I'm really glad you asked that because it gets to why we're so focused on the medium to long term because we do believe there is some very strong structural advantages that come into play. It's directly connecting with consumers, is critical to serve consumers going forward to have that direct connection, use our membership program to translate what has been a transactional relationship into a lifetime relationship of value, whether it's through directly or through our partners. And with our movement toward Direct, both Digital and our monobrand brand stores, as Matt has said, each quarter, there is a structural benefit to our margins. And so it has - it's good for consumer, it's good for competitive position and it's also good for our margins. And so that's why we're staying ruthlessly focused on it. That's why you see our digital growth rates still continue to be quite strong, and we will continue to move ahead on our marketplace strategy. So we continue to be confident in the five-year macro outlook that - and guardrails Matt put out there. The exact timing of those, I think we're a little bit out of the game. We're trying to predict year in and year out, given how dynamic it is. But the structural things that we've laid out in our strategy, we believe, are strong today. Matthew Friend : And still achievable. John Donahoe : And still achievable. Paul Trussell : Thank you for the question, Michael. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

For those who want to reference today's press release, you'll find it at investors.nike.com. Leading today's call is Paul Trussell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Trussell, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in NIKE's reports filed with the SEC. In addition, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures and non-public financial and statistical information. Please refer to NIKE's earnings press release or NIKE's website, investors.nike.com, for comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Trussell. Please go ahead. Paul Trussell : Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal 2023 second quarter results. Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe; and our Chief Financial Officer, Matt Friend. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So we would appreciate you limiting your initial question to one. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe. John Donahoe : Thank you, Paul, and hello to everyone on today's call. We delivered a strong quarter in Q2 with revenue growth of 17% on a reported basis and 27% on a currency-neutral basis. And looking at the quarter's results, we delivered our Q2 expectations on revenue, profitability and inventory. In this current environment, our consumer demand stands out. Today, we're creating more separation between us and our competition. Thanks to the meaningful relationships we have consumers and the continued success of our strategy. Our Q2 growth was broad-based across our brands, channels and geographies. We had strong double-digit growth across both our partners and our direct business, which was once again led by our industry-leading digital performance. The quarter saw more than 30% currency-neutral growth in our North America, EMEA and APLA geographies. And after nearly two years of unprecedented disruptions, Greater China grew 6% on a currency constant basis, translated to minus 3% on a reported basis due to foreign exchange. Clearly, our brand continues to not only be top of mind, but prioritized by consumers around the globe. In addition to our results, we're executing in the areas we spoke to 90 days ago as we take decisive action to clear excess inventory. We believe the inventory peak is behind us as actions we're taking in the marketplace are working. Later in the call, Matt will share more about our progress on inventory in North America and a return to healthy inventory levels in China. So overall, our Q2 results give us confidence that we will deliver the year, and we remain on a path toward our long-term goals as well. Our current headwinds, such as foreign exchange and inventory challenges are transitory, but our tailwinds are structural. Like the expanding definition of sport, the consumers move toward digital and the cultural shifts toward comfort and health and wellness. More importantly, our results speak to how we've leveraged our competitive advantages which include a relentless innovation pipeline, match brands and deep consumer connections to build relative strength and stay ahead of competition. As you heard me say before, at NIKE, it all starts with product innovation. And this quarter, I'd like to highlight an important part of our culture of innovation, our constant pursuit to improve on our most popular platforms. We win with product because we know it's not only about individual innovations, but also about our ability to continuously bring newness to our greatest franchises. For instance, earlier this quarter, we launched the LeBron 20 to strong consumer response. What's unique about the LeBron 20 is that its LeBron's first signature shoe to debut as a low-top. Driven by consumer insight and performance demands from LeBron himself, this style combines innovation with sportswear design to create greater commercial appeal with its ability to be worn on the court and off.  And we're not just bringing innovation and excitement to existing franchises; we continue to expand the portfolio. Coming soon, we've got some exciting signature debuts in NIKE Basketball and Jordan brand that we can't wait for consumers to see. With our strong product portfolio and unparalleled roster of athletes that we have today, we couldn't be more excited about the future of our basketball business. Last quarter, I highlighted another franchise in another sport getting an upgrade, the Mercurial, which added Zoom airbag to create NIKE's fastest football boot ever. And during the exciting World Cup over the last several weeks, the new Mercurial scored more goals than any other boot, led by Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 who won the Golden Boot as the tournament's top scorer. In fact, NIKE's boots dominated the World Cup, scoring more goals than all other brands combined. And consumers have responded to this energy, giving the new Mercurial the highest full price realization of any performance product this quarter globally. And of course, for us, it doesn't just end in innovation with product. NIKE's innovation can also be felt with our rich and powerful storytelling and our deep brand engagement, particularly in global sports moments like the World Cup. NIKE's unique ability to bring together product storytelling in the world's best athletes has once again created something that only NIKE can. As I mentioned earlier, our Q2 results speak to the continued success of our strategy. Consumer Direct Acceleration is fueling our marketplace approach in which we directly connect with the consumer no matter where they shop. Today, our marketplace strategy is driving distinction in this current promotional environment. Our work to directly connect with consumers is founded on a simple consumer insight. Consumers want to get what they want, when they want it and how they want it. And consumers have told us they want a consistent, seamless and premium experience both digitally and physically around mono-brand and multi-brand. And so we're serving consumers digitally with our suite of apps. We're extending our reach and convenience through our strategic wholesale partnerships and leveraging mono-brand doors to fill the gap for underserved opportunities like women's fitness and Jordan. The key is building meaningful direct lifelong relationships with consumers. We deeply believe this will be an important source of differentiation going forward. Why? Well, for one, having a direct connection with consumers avoids the risk of disintermediation. In other words, with the consumer base that comes directly to our apps, to our website and to our owned and partner stores. We, alongside our partners are in a position to control our own destiny. And ultimately, this direct connection enables us to understand consumers better so that we can serve them better with the right assortment, with the right partners and at the right touch points. And what showcases the success of this strategy is our membership base. Membership was a key reason our digital business grew an industry-leading 34% this quarter. Q2 was our biggest member demand quarter ever, and we saw double-digit growth in member engagement. Today, we have roughly 160 million active members who engage with us on a regular basis. And more importantly, our repeat buying members who are more engaged spend more and spend more frequently are growing at an even faster pace of high double digits as they continue to be an important growth engine for our business. And our members also shop seamlessly across the marketplace.  In addition to digital, a key member on ramp for us is through our NIKE stores. In fact, more than 50% of store demand comes from members and cross-channel members are even more valuable with higher demand per member than single channel members. An important enabler of giving consumers a personalized shopping experience regardless of channel is our connected membership program with our strategic partners. You've heard us discuss it before, scaling connected membership with DSG, JD Sports, Zalando and TopSports. And today, we're seeing results that are beneficial for everyone. NIKE is already learning more about our members, which helps us elevate in areas such as product creation, line planning and the experiences we deliver. And our partners are telling us that these engaged members are driving improved traffic, conversion and mutual profitability for them as well. And so while it's still early days on this journey, we're excited by the foundation we're creating. The ability to give consumers a personalized experience across channels, fueled by data and insight opens up a whole host of opportunity for us. It positions us to empower consumers with their own choice while keeping the scalability and strengths in digital marketing, product creation, distribution and more, which results from knowing them so well. So ultimately, it will make NIKE a better retailer and also a better wholesale partner. Last but not least, I want to take a moment to acknowledge our Greater China team and the 6% growth they just delivered. As I said earlier, it's been nearly two years of unprecedented disruption in China. But this team's resilience, experience and strategy has set us apart to gain momentum on all fronts. Last month, we had a record-breaking 11.11 consumer moment, which concluded with double-digit demand growth and NIKE having outperformed the industry. And we keep setting new records as part of this important shopping holiday : #1 brand, # 1 in traffic, #1 in live streaming, # 1 flagship store, #1 in membership acquisition and # 1 in member demand penetration. And we're not just #1. This quarter, we saw movement in relative positioning as we create even more competitive separation coming out of this important consumer moment. And as you know, we have remained committed to investing in Greater China for the long term. Even in this dynamic environment, we continue to invest in technology, local marketing and more as we believe the best way to capture demand in China is to serve consumers in a locally relevant way. And today, we're getting a true competitive boost from our investments in these new capabilities. Let me just highlight a few. We launched China-specific versions of our apps to build NIKE experiences that are faster, more engaging and more personalized. We created a first-of-its-kind China-specific member journey with Tmall, which saw a significant uplift in new member recruitment and demand per member. We piloted connected membership with member-linked transactions to 42 NSP stores in 18 cities across China, driving conversion, member acquisition and retaining high-value members. And our team continues to drive China for China capabilities like delivering hyper local product design and localizing marketing content creation. Thanks to this focus, we're now serving our consumers in China with an agile, dynamic and personal way like never before. We're confident in our ability to compete and win in this marketplace for the long term. In the end, I just want to say how proud I am of our entire global team. In times like this, it's people that make the difference. And a great team can turn challenges into opportunities, and we've got a great team, and that is exactly what they have done. This is a group who will stay on the offense to deliver the business while also creating the future of NIKE. We'll continue to build an even stronger position and I couldn't be more excited. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Matthew Friend : Thanks, John, and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE's second quarter of fiscal '23 demonstrated again the power of our portfolio of brands. Throughout the quarter, we leveraged our brand momentum and deepened our connections with consumers to drive strong revenue growth. Before going into our second quarter results and financial outlook, I want to provide more insight on the strong consumer demand that we continue to see and the progress that we have made over the past 90 days regarding our inventory. Consumer demand for our brands drove double-digit currency-neutral revenue growth across NIKE, Jordan and Converse. Within NIKE Direct, retail traffic was up, conversion rates expanded and member buying fueled record digital results. Within wholesale, we saw strong retail sales and market share gains across our top strategic partners. Since last quarter, our brand momentum has accelerated into the holiday season. In North America, our Black Friday and Cyber Week performance set record highs for demand and traffic, fueling strong double-digit revenue growth and exceeding our plan. In EMEA, we closed our biggest Cyber Week ever increasing demand by 75% from last year. In Greater China, our 11.11 demand grew mid-teens, outpacing the sports industry. And globally, our holiday season momentum has continued through the first few weeks of December. Despite operating a largely promotional marketplace, we are creating brand distinction by driving healthy, profitable growth. Full price realization remains strong after strategic pricing increases, especially for our top innovation products in our largest footwear franchises. NIKE Brand ASP is up year-over-year across our geographies, even with higher discounts to liquidate excess inventory. This quarter, we also leveraged targeted promotions to serve and acquire NIKE members, strengthening an important foundation for sustainable growth. Above all, our Q2 results reinforce our confidence that NIKE's brand and business momentum starts with the value that we create for consumers through our product innovation, deep brand connection and elevated experiences across the marketplace. Now let me turn to inventory. Last quarter, we talked specifically about the actions we are taking to address excess inventory, with focus on pockets of seasonally late products, predominantly in apparel. At the end of Q2, we are tracking in line with our plan, and we are pleased with the progress we have made over the last 90 days. Let me go deeper into what we are seeing and why I am optimistic about our path ahead. First, inventory dollars and units are down sequentially. Prior year comparisons are distorted by last year's Vietnam factory closures. But compared to the prior quarter, inventory dollars were down 3% and units are down high single digits, with days in inventory at the lowest level in four quarters.  Second, we are making progress where we are focused most. In North America, year-over-year growth in inventory dollars decelerated from 65% in Q1 to 54% in Q2. More importantly, total inventory units are down low double digits from first quarter levels, even as spring product continues to arrive earlier with faster transit times.  Third, the composition of our inventory is improving. In North America, apparel inventory units and apparel closeout units are both down mid-teens from the prior quarter.  Last, we have proactively reduced forward supply. As I mentioned last quarter, we have tightened our second half buys to prioritize inventory health across the marketplace. As transit times stabilize, we are optimistic that we will begin to see a more normal and predictable flow supply in a more capital-efficient manner. Looking ahead, we are confident that our decisive actions have put us on the right track within the financial parameters that we provided last quarter. Our focus continues to be positioning NIKE for future seasons of sustainable and profitable growth. Now let me turn to our NIKE Inc. second quarter financial results. In Q2, NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 17% and 27% on a currency-neutral basis with strong growth across the portfolio. NIKE Direct grew by 25%, led by 34% growth in NIKE Digital and 11% growth in NIKE stores, highlighted by strong season-to-date holiday results. Wholesale grew by 30%, driven by strong demand for seasonal products, higher shipments based on earlier supply availability and lower shipments in the prior year given supply constraints. Second quarter reported gross margin declined 300 basis points to 42.9%, primarily due to higher markdowns, mainly in North America, unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, elevated freight and logistics costs and increased product input costs, partially offset by strategic pricing actions. SG&A grew 10% in Q2, primarily due to wage-related expenses, strategic technology investments, higher NIKE Direct costs and increased demand creation expenses. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.3% compared to 10.9% for the same period last year, primarily due to decreased benefits from stock-based compensation and earnings mix. Second quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.85.  Now let's review the operating segment results. In North America, we captured market share, with strong holiday results and positive consumer response to new assortments. Q2 revenue grew 31% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT grew 21% on a reported basis. NIKE Direct grew 23%, with NIKE Digital up 31% on double-digit growth in traffic and repeat member buying. Wholesale revenue grew 37%, driven by strong marketplace partner demand and improved inventory supply. Performance innovation and fresh seasonal product resonated deeply with consumers. The LeBron 20, KD and Giannis fueled double-digit growth in basketball. And the AJ11\u2019s Varsity Red shock drop highlighted Jordan Brand\u2019s momentum. In women's, our new statement leggings, NIKE Girl, launched with positive early response as the Free Metcon grew double digits. Dunk outperformed in men's, and Pegasus continues to win with everyday runners. Beyond product innovation, NIKE continues to create distinction at the intersection of culture and community. Ahead of homecoming season, our Yardrunners campaign elevated the voices of HBCU changemakers alongside the release of co-created product through our SNKRS App and neighborhood partners. In addition, with the recent announcement of future Nike x Off-White collections, we are deeply honored to introduce the next chapter of Virgil Abloh\u2019s continuing legacy with NIKE. In EMEA, our team landed yet another strong quarter. Q2 revenue grew 33% on a currency neutral basis and EBIT grew 23% on a reported basis. NIKE Direct grew 44% on a currency-neutral basis with NIKE Digital growing 62%. Membership was an accelerator as members drove over 85% of demand during Cyber Week, our highest demand week ever in EMEA. Our campaign led with sport, adding more than 1 million new NIKE members as we invited consumers to join us in celebrating the World Cup. The power of our portfolio drove momentum across the marketplace. Earlier this month, we celebrated the Milan opening of Jordan World of Flight, a premium retail concept at the forefront of basketball culture. Meanwhile, NIKE dominated shoe and apparel accounts at the Berlin and London marathons, as Alphafly drove strong sell-through. Pegasus Shield and Winflo Shield grew double digits in women's running. Zegama created energy in trail running, the sport's fastest-growing segment and Global Football grew double digits as we continue to celebrate an incredible year of sports. In Greater China, our brand and business momentum continued as Q2 revenue grew 6% on a currency-neutral basis and EBIT declined 10% on a reported basis. NIKE Direct grew 4% on a currency-neutral basis, with NIKE Digital growing 9%. In addition to delivering positive growth, we achieved our goal of returning to inventory health at the end of Q2. Inventory dollars declined 3% this quarter and close out inventory was down high double digits versus the prior year, with closeout mix now in line with pre-pandemic levels. Our team delivered these results while managing through significant COVID-related disruption, including the closure of over 1,500 owned and partner stores at the end of November. We continue to closely monitor ongoing risk while focusing on what we can control, deepening our connections with Chinese consumers. As 18,000 runners joined in the return of the Shanghai Marathon, our brand presence was deeply felt, not only as the title sponsor, but also as NIKE dominated the shoe count and local NIKE athlete, Zhang Deshun, topped the podium. The energy extended into double-digit growth through our running business led by Zoom Fly and Vaporfly as well as the Pegasus and Winflo. NIKE's brand momentum with our youngest Chinese consumers continues to grow as well. On 11.11, Gen Z demand for NIKE grew by 45% on Tmall. And with NIKE leading on 11.11 as the #1 store on Tmall's Kids footwear channel, plus our top kids lifestyle footwear franchises growing double digits in Q2, we are more excited than ever about NIKE's opportunity to serve the next generation. Finally, in APLA, our team continues to over-deliver in our fastest-growing, most diverse geography. Q2 revenue grew 34% on a currency-neutral basis, and EBIT grew 25% on a reported basis despite the transition of our SOCO territory to a distributor model. NIKE Direct grew 30% on a currency-neutral basis and NIKE Digital grew 35%. We deepened consumer connections across territories with member days fueling robust growth. In Korea, one of our fast-growing marketplaces, we're excited to integrate our digital business on to NIKE's global platform, which will enable us to serve Korean consumers through the NIKE and SNKRS App. We also continue to strengthen local connections through our Express Lane with launches such as our Somos Familia collection. Across APLA, this quarter showed the power of our complete offense. In women's, we drove energy in lifestyle with local storytelling around the Air Force 1's 40th anniversary. Global Football and Running led the way in men's performance, and Kids delivered balanced growth across apparel and footwear. Finally, the Jordan brand continues to be an incredible engine for growth with momentum in streetwear and performance footwear. Now I will turn to our financial outlook. As I said last quarter, we are taking a measured approach in the second half against an uncertain macro outlook as we continue to prioritize a healthy pull market. That said, we remain positive regarding the strong consumer demand we see across our portfolio of brands as well as the health of our product franchises. From product innovation to rich storytelling, the value that NIKE creates for the consumer continues to drive business momentum and competitive separation across the marketplace. Given our strong second quarter performance, we now expect full year revenue to grow low teens on a currency-neutral basis, an improvement from our low double-digit guidance in the prior quarter. As of today, we expect approximately 700 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds, resulting in full year reported revenue growth of mid-single digits. Third quarter revenue growth is expected to be higher than the fourth quarter due to timing of wholesale shipments. We continue to expect gross margin to decline between 200 basis points to 250 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting ongoing liquidation actions in the second half. This outlook reflects our strong performance in Q2, mostly offset by an additional 25 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact, now totaling 95 basis points for the full year. We expect the third quarter gross margin will decline at a similar rate as the second quarter, including 120 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. For the full year, we continue to expect SG&A to increase high single digits. We expect third quarter SG&A dollars to be in line with the second quarter. And we now expect our effective tax rate to be in the high teens range, primarily due to decreased benefits from stock-based compensation.  As many of you know, we closed out NIKE's 50th anniversary this year. And for all the history NIKE has already made, it's the future that inspires us most. After all, NIKE's culture of innovation doesn't just shape the products we create and the stories we tell. It also defines the way we adapt and accelerate through dynamic conditions. Over this past year, no matter what we have faced, our teammates have continued to come together and deliver. I could not be more proud of their efforts. And as we turn toward NIKE's next 50 years, I have every confidence in the future this team will create. To every member of our NIKE Jordan and Converse team around the world, thank you for all that you do and happy holidays. With that, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] With that, we move to our first question this afternoon from Jim Duffy at Stifel. Jim Duffy : I'm hoping you can help with more insights on the composition of growth in North America and where you stand with clearance efforts. I believe, Matt, you said ASP was up in all geographies. Is that true for North America as well? And then looking at the split between footwear and apparel growth : footwear, very strong acceleration; apparel, more modest despite what I would have expected clearance efforts. Can you just speak to where you stand with respect to moving to those apparel balances? John Donahoe : Sure, Jim. We saw strong growth in the North America marketplace, up 31%. And really, as you noted, it was really strong across channels, NIKE Direct and our wholesale partners as well as across gender. Our Jordan brand delivered incredibly strong growth in the quarter as well as our footwear business. Yes, our ASPs overall for the geography were up. That was definitely benefited by strong performance in our footwear business. I mentioned our strong demand that we saw over the holiday season. And in particular, the consumer moments right at the end of the quarter. But throughout the entire quarter, we continue to see strong levels of full price realization in footwear, which continue to give us confidence in our most important product franchises, the stories that we continue to tell to refresh and make them relevant as well as the new products that we continue to bring to market on a seasonal basis.  Specifically to your question about inventory and our actions there in North America, I referenced that we saw our units down versus Q1 levels, low double digits. And our focus in the quarter was really around our apparel liquidation as well as managing apparel closeouts. And both those dimensions were down mid-teens from a unit perspective versus the prior quarter. We continue to see strong demand from our value partners on the wholesale side for our out-of-season apparel. And we continue to be very confident in our ability to continue that liquidation through the balance of this fiscal year. Operator : We take our next question now from Bob Drbul at Guggenheim Securities. Bob Drbul : I guess just on the inventory, Matt, is there a number, as you think through the next few quarters, could you give us an idea of where you think you'll land in terms of the inventory levels or when you might sort of have a more normalized number either in North America or overall? Matthew Friend : Sure, Bob. Well, as I mentioned, we are really pleased with the progress that we delivered this quarter and where we ended Q2 is in line with the plans that we set 90 days ago. I guess the first thing I'd say is our prior year comparisons on inventory are really distorting the progress that we made this quarter because a year ago, we were undergoing 15 weeks of lost production capacity from our factories being closed in Vietnam. And so, it depressed the base quite significantly. When we look at the progress that we made this quarter where we needed to focus most, we feel really good about the momentum that we have there. And when we look at the brand momentum that we had into the holiday season and into the holiday season and where our partners are at, we continue to be confident in the momentum that we're building there, especially in the pockets of inventory that were elevated as a result of what transpired last quarter. I'll tell you two other things. As we look at transit times continuing to improve, one of the things that gives us greater confidence is a more predictable flow of supply on normal lead times. If you recall what we've been navigating over the past two years, it's been pretty significant and volatile, and it continues to increase our confidence levels. But we're focused on prioritizing healthy pull markets going into fiscal year '24. And so we expect the spread of inventory growth to revenue growth to continue to narrow over the second half. We already showed strong improvement this quarter, but we expect that spread to continue to narrow in the second half, and that will be driven based on strong demand and also the buy tightening that we did for the second half last quarter. Operator : We'll go next now to Matthew Boss at JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Thanks, and congrats on a nice quarter. So maybe for John, two strict quarters of double-digit accelerating constant currency revenue growth. I guess, can you speak to the level of brand heat for NIKE that you're seeing in the marketplace today? Maybe elaborate, Matt, I think you cited market share gains that you're seeing in North America. And then just what's your confidence in sustaining this kind of momentum as we think about your product pipeline moving forward? John Donahoe : Yes. Sure, Matt. The -- one of the refrains we've been using repeatedly, frankly, for the last 2.5 years is in times of turbulence, strong brands can get stronger, and that is our ultimate -- that's our ultimate goal, which is whatever challenges or opportunities get faced by everyone, we want to make sure that we capitalize better than others and get stronger and gain share. And that's what you're seeing through the last couple of quarters, and we believe continuing in the next several quarters. And frankly, the fundamentals are simply leveraging our competitive advantages. It's that sort of unique NIKE combination of great product, product innovation, like the Mercurial or combined with great roster of athletes and teams with great storytelling that you really bring to life in moments like the Euro chance for women's last summer and Men's World Cup this year, combined with distribution where we're getting consumers what we want, when they want, how they want it. And so it's that combination that certainly -- and as we come out of more and more COVID, we're being able to pull together time and time again, the LeBron 20, another great example, great product, great storytelling. I hope everyone enjoyed those commercials with a great athlete, and that sold through throughout the globe very, very quickly. And if there's one dimension that I would say is kind of a fourth source of competitive advantage from our historical ones, it's this digital advantage. And it's -- you see we grew digital 34% in an e-commerce -- global e-commerce market that most people would say is low single digits. And that is where having the direct connection with consumers, having the best apps in the industry allows us to leverage the full funnel of membership base. And we believe that's going to be an important fourth source of competitive advantage throughout the globe, and that will continue for quarters and years to come. So we're staying focused on the fundamentals to be honest. And with the strong mantras let's make sure we get stronger and create greater competitive separation regardless of what the environment throws us. Matthew Friend : Yes. And I just would say on the comment about market share and confidence, really, you saw the balanced growth we delivered this quarter across channels. And as John mentioned, it really does start with digital with that 34% growth. But I wouldn't want you to miss the importance of the funnel and the way that we're converting active members to buying members and increasing member buying frequency because our growth in actually over-indexed our overall digital growth, really referencing that, that strength of the consumer coming in. From a wholesale standpoint, the momentum that we're seeing is strong retail sales from our wholesale partners to consumers. But you'll recall that we've been starving the wholesale channel for six to eight quarters because of supply constraints. And so as we had supply constraints, we were prioritizing adequate inventory levels within NIKE Direct. And so we're seeing strong demand as we go back into our wholesale partners with available supply. That's enabling us to increase our open to buy in that channel. And as inventory supply becomes available on a greater basis than it was, we continue to see our partners pulling on the available inventory. So we're competing in that channel. There it's an important channel for us to lean in. And really for the first time in six quarters or so, we can finally supply the channel against the level of demand that we believe is there. Operator : We take our next question now from Kate McShane of Goldman Sachs. Brooke Roach : This is Brooke Roach filling in for Kate. John, I wanted to ask you a little bit about what you think the next phase of the membership journey for NIKE would look like following the success that's achieved with that program to date? And then perhaps in the near term, how much of the strength of NIKE Digital that you're seeing today is due to underlying full price selling? And how much of that may be driven by increased depth of promotions, driving the consumer to convert at a higher rate? John Donahoe : Well, on membership, the way we think about membership is along the full funnel. And so the first thing I'll say about that I think is a really important dimension of membership is membership is no longer just something that happens in NIKE channels. Having connected membership with our strategic wholesale partners now allows the consumer to have a member experience regardless of where they shop and allows our wholesale partners to have the same advantages that we have by knowing who the consumer is, what they\u2019ve bought and being able to serve them in a more personalized way. And so I would say we're still in the relative early innings of what we believe we can do on the membership on the membership front. We have 160 million active members. We're working on engaging them more frequently, whether it's through NIKE Training Club, NIKE Run Club, the SNKRS App where it's more than just what they buy, but it's their engagement. We think there's a lot of content that we can be bringing to those members and you're going to see some, I think, interesting announcements in the coming weeks about partnerships and things we're doing to drive engagement across NIKE members. And then down to the bottom of the funnel, it's making sure we're getting them as I say repeatedly what they want, when they want it, how they want it, knowing what products they want, making sure they have the best possible experiences making sure that repeat buying is made easy and convenient. I would say the supply chain dimensions and what we've been doing with our membership is just phenomenal, having gone from 10% digital to 27% delivering fast delivery times, fewer reduced and split shipments. And so it's really kind of a holistic approach, and we're going to just keep leveraging that and keep building upon that. As I said, I think we're in the roll days. And then our digital growth, I think, is a function of having the best apps in the industry or on the home screen of people's mobile apps, which is that scarce and valuable real estate. And we have a really clean experience across our apps and digitally, including NIKE.com. So there's -- we have good full price realization, and when need to move things, we move it through discounting. And so it's obviously very fair product category and varies by time. But the quality of the business through NIKE Digital is among the highest quality that we have across any channel. Matthew Friend : Yes. When you compare this quarter to last year, our inventory supply was so lean that last year, we saw extraordinary levels full price realization through our digital channel and the lowest levels of discounts that we've ever experienced in running that channel. So we expected that to normalize in this fiscal year. And with where inventory is broadly across the marketplace, the environment is definitely more promotional. But as John mentioned, when we look at our most important product franchises, we continue to see strong full price realization in our own channels and in wholesale. And I'd say that the other thing that we focused on this quarter was leveraging our investment in markdown to drive new member acquisition and to increase loyalty from our existing members, and we were able to accomplish that this quarter. Operator : We take our next question now from Tom Nikic at Wedbush Securities. Tom Nikic : I wanted to ask about China. So obviously, returning to growth in a pretty challenging environment is fairly encouraging. How do we think about the path forward in China from here? I know you mentioned that inventory is much cleaner in China now. So should we think that you're kind of back to a pull market in China? You should be able to sort of build off the momentum you've had this quarter. Just how do we kind of think about the path forward in China from here? John Donahoe : Yes, Tom, well, maybe I'll take a piece of it and then, Matt, you can comment as well because it's such an important topic. You heard both of us talk about that given all the short medium-term challenges, we are very pleased with the results in China this quarter. And the thing that we've been really focused on is the consumer, the Chinese consumer and their connection to the NIKE, Jordan and Converse brands. And the 11.11 holiday was one that we focused on a lot because it's really, in many ways, the first time in over two years that we could fully compete. We had the supply of the right product, including some of our hottest global and local product. We had a full local marketing capability going full stream, and we had our kind of entire offense. And the results of the 11.11 holiday were quite strong, both versus what our plan was and versus competition. We had mid-teens growth overall. We've been very focused on youth in China, the young consumer, both kids and Gen Z. You heard Matt say, our Gen Z grew 45% in demand on Tmall through 11.11. And as I said in my script, we're #1 in traffic and brand and flagship and member acquisition. And the quality of that growth is quite strong underneath it. When you look at the Jordan brand, you look at I mentioned LeBron 20, great full price realization. So we felt very about the consumer fully back with NIKE, with Jordan, our ability to compete with both global and local competition. And we take that into the coming quarters. Matthew Friend : Yes. And I just would comment on inventory. We set a goal two quarters ago to be clean by the end of the second quarter, and we reduced our buys and we focused on moving through the excess inventory that we had. And so we're incredibly pleased with the results that our team has delivered through the end of this quarter. We think it puts us in a position of strength relative to the marketplace to be clean and to be ready to face whatever uncertainties are in front of us. I obviously mentioned that we had 1,500 of our stores closed in the last week of November. That was roughly 5x the number of stores that were closed on average throughout the entire quarter. And we also saw traffic impacts as the country navigates through this transition of its COVID policy. So we've taken a very cautious approach in our guidance to China, given the short-term uncertainties that are there. But what you should be hearing from us is a consistent trend of confidence and encouragement in the consumer connections that we're creating that give us confidence in the long term. Operator : We take our next question now from Adrienne Yih of Barclays. Matthew Friend : Good afternoon and congratulations, really a nice amazing quarter. My question is on Greater China. Obviously, this is the first quarter we're now starting to see that constant currency growth. So very happy to see that inflection. What have you seen sort of after the quarter as things have opened up even more sort of in the December timeframe? And does it give you any -- do you have any more kind of solid thoughts on sort of what the growth algorithm could look like, maybe 2023 and beyond or it\u2019s still very much too early? Last question is, when does that Shenzhen tech center -- I believe is it open now and when is it starting to put forth that China-specific product? John Donahoe : Sure, Adrienne. On your first question, I think I answered it in the last question. But as it relates to our performance this quarter and how we're planning for the second half of this year. We've obviously been measuring the China marketplace very carefully given the COVID-related disruptions that we've been experiencing. We've sort of gone from one policy in terms of the way that the marketplace is being managed and to control the spread of the virus to this new approach. And I referenced the door closures that we saw at the end of the quarter. As it relates to our guidance and our expectations, I guess what I can say is that we're taking a very careful approach. We have a lot of empathy for the consumers in terms of what they're going through in that environment. And we're watching traffic closely. But having inventory cleaned at the end of the second quarter really gives us a position of strength to deal with whatever uncertainties that are in front of us. As far as the longer term goes, it's a little bit too early to tell, except we continue to think about the encouraging signs that we're seeing from a consumer perspective. And as John mentioned, 11.11 was really one of the first moments in several years that we felt like we were able to align the complete offense up in order to be able to engage across products -- product engines, gender and brands. And we saw very strong consumer response. And so when we look at the underlying macro drivers long term of the consumer interest in sport health in Greater China, we continue to view it as a growth driver for our business long term. Operator : We go next now to Abbie Zvejnieks at Piper Sandler. Abbie Zvejnieks : So looking at the strength in wholesale, I know you said there was better inventory availability to ship to those wholesale channels. But can you just talk about how you're viewing the wholesale channel considering your direct strategy? And with that growth, did you enter or reenter any new doors? Or was this growth mainly within those current partners you've already talked about? John Donahoe : Yes. Abbie, the strategy remains very much the same. And as I mentioned repeatedly, it's consumer driven. It is consumers in this day and age want to get what they want, when they want, how they want it and they want a consistent and seamless experience from us. The same consumer shop online and offline, the same consumer shop mono-brand and multi-brand through different occasions. And so our whole strategy is to offer them that choice in a seamless and premium way. And then wholesale plays a very important part of that, right? It provides a very strong footprint, both physical footprint as well as digital. And we mentioned last quarter, we had our wholesale partners on campus in September for the first time in three years and exposed them to our product innovation pipeline and just talked about how working together, we can really serve that consumer through connected membership. And those conversations have just gone great. For instance, this quarter, we spent a lot of time with Mary Dillon and her team at Foot Locker talking about how the next phase of growth for us can jointly be great around real opportunities of basketball and sneaker culture and kids. And so there's a lot of excitement, I would say, with our wholesale partners and what we can accomplish together and particularly through a connected membership environment, which allows us to serve our mutual consumers in a better way. Matthew Friend : Yes. And I would just say that from a revenue growth perspective, we think this quarter was clearly a peak in terms of year-over-year revenue growth in the channel. And that's primarily driven by timing implications. There's the prior year comparison because we were low on available inventory for the wholesale channel, which depressed our growth in the prior year. And secondly, because we're seeing current season product becoming available earlier, we saw a stronger pull of shipments from Q3 into Q2 into our revenue growth this quarter. And I think that's indicative of the demand that we're seeing and the strong sell-through that we're seeing through to the consumer. So we continue to view this channel as being a channel that will drive growth. But for the balance of this year, the comparisons are going to be difficult to understand when compared to the prior year due to the supply constraints we had in the prior year. Operator : We go next now to John Kernan of Cowen. John Kernan : Excellent. Congrats on a nice quarter and the acceleration. Just, Matt, as we look at the constant currency revenue guidance implied for the back half of the year, it does assume a bit of a deceleration. Just talk about some of the assumptions regarding the macro? And is there a level of conservatism as you look at the back half of the year. Matthew Friend : Sure, John. Well, first, I'd say we raised our guidance to low teens on a currency-neutral basis, really reflecting the accelerating brand momentum that we saw in August carrying through back-to-school into September and then accelerating through the holiday season and even the first couple of weeks of December. And so we do have confidence as we're looking in the near term that the consumer continues to be uniquely interested in NIKE, Jordan and Converse, and it's fueling our growth. What I said last quarter is still true, though, which is that we were concerned about the macro uncertainty and the indicators that we're seeing more broadly for the consumer. And while over the last 90 days, we've seen strength. Those macro concerns have not abated. They're still there for the consumer. And so we continue to take a cautious approach to the second half. We buy our inventory, as you know, on six-month lead times. And so we took some decisions in light of the inventory -- our inventory position at the end of Q1 to reduce our buys for the second half of the year. And we focus those reductions in places where we had excess inventory, but we preserve the strength of our product franchises and the new innovation that John referenced earlier in the call that's going to be coming to market in the second half and in the beginning of '23.  So we continue to take a cautious approach as we look at it. And to the extent that consumer demand continues to be strong, with a supply chain that's providing product in a more predictable manner, in a more timely manner, if we ended up overcorrecting on our buys, then we will chase demand as we exit this year and enter into fiscal year '24. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one further question this afternoon, and we'll take that from Michael Binetti at Credit Suisse. Michael Binetti : Congrats on a great quarter. I know it's a lot of heavy lifting. It may be a simple question, but how do you feel on North America inventory in the channel? I know you moved the mountain, but you have a big wholesale business is hard for us to track inventory once it leaves your books. Are we past the peak promotions in the U.S.? Is this the highest level of promotions in your view? It would seem so based on some of the inventory comments you gave on the U.S., I just wanted to check that. And then I guess as you start to come out of some of the recent volatility, maybe you can help us connect back to your longer-term targets, in particular, the path to the high teens EBIT margins and the major input to getting there, the D2C versus wholesale transition since we don't get many numbers reported on the margins between those two channels. How would you tell us to think about building our understanding into how you get there from here is that seems like the next part of the NIKE story? Matthew Friend : Sure, Michael. Well, as it relates to North America and the marketplace, we're seeing the momentum from a consumer perspective, building across both channels over this holiday season. So yes, promotional activity is higher than it was in the prior year. But we do see strong full price sales in footwear and in our seasonal inventory, and we see more promotional activity in areas that are -- where inventory has built and/or there's just broader inventory availability in the marketplace. I think our focus continues to be in this environment on prioritizing our brand getting to a healthy inventory position by the end of this fiscal year with why we've taken more aggressive action. But I think we've been pleased at seeing the year-over-year ASP growth, not just in North America but across all our geographies and high levels of full price realization in the areas where our consumers are most interested, and it's hard to get access to the products that they desire, which means that from a brand health perspective, even amidst the promotion, the consumer continues to choose NIKE. As it relates to your question about the long-term margins, I guess the way that I think about it is we have structural drivers of profitability, and we have transitory impacts that we've been dealing with since fiscal '21. At this point in time, the transitory impacts roughly equate to about 350 basis points of gross margin pressure, which directly drops to the EBIT margin. And those specifically relate to two successive years of elevated transit and freight costs; and then secondarily, the cost to liquidate some of the excess inventory in North America. And we do expect those to be transient or transitory. We should expect to start to see some recovery in fiscal year '24. We will give more detailed guidance on that in our normal course. But those, we do believe are recoverable. From a structural side, we have the same structural drivers that we've always had from a profitability perspective, and we continue to be focused on them. It starts with price value of our products and how we create value for consumers and the products that we make. You saw that we increased prices by mid-single digits this quarter, and we continue to see that so long as the product is valued by the consumer, we've been able to stick those price increases in order to help offset growing input costs, there's cost initiatives in our FOBs that we're focused on. We have the shift towards NIKE Direct. This quarter, that didn't drive any benefit because we saw strong wholesale growth, but we do expect to see a benefit from a structural perspective as we continue to drive accelerated growth in NIKE Direct through our stores and through digital. We continue to focus on supply chain efficiency opportunities and then continuing to drive higher full price realization across the marketplace through better capabilities in demand and supply planning. So those structural drivers we continue to believe are going to be accelerants for us. But given the size of the transitory impacts that we've dealt with over the past two years, it's really important that we drive focus and attention on recovery of some of those elements. And trust me, our teams are focused on it, and we believe those will be value drivers for us in the near term. Paul Trussell : All right. Thank you, Michael, for the question and everyone who was able to join in and participate in this call. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Happy holidays. John Donahoe : Happy holidays, everyone. Operator : Thank you, gentlemen. Again, that will conclude NIKE Inc.'s fiscal 2023 Second Quarter Conference Call. We'd like to thank you all so much for joining us and wish you all a great evening. Goodbye.",

Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe; and our Chief Financial Officer, Matt Friend. Following their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial question to one. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I will now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc., President and CEO, John Donahoe. John Donahoe : Thank you, Paul, and hello to everyone on today's call. We delivered another strong quarter in Q3, with revenue growth of 14% on a reported basis and 19% on a currency-neutral basis, exceeding our plan. Our growth this quarter was broad-based across our brands, channels and geographies. We had strong digital growth of 24%, which once again was fueled by double-digit increases in traffic on mobile and our apps. And while Direct, led by Digital, remains strong and will continue to drive our growth, our wholesale channel continues to be an important part of our strategy as we access key consumer segments and achieve distribution scale across the marketplace. Wholesale grew 18% in Q3, reflecting strong retail sales with growth that over-indexed across our strategic partners. This quarter continued our positive currency-neutral growth in all four of our geographies. North America, EMEA and APLA all delivered double-digit revenue growth. Greater China grew 1% despite a very challenging December following the shift in the country's COVID policies. And we're making great progress on inventory with our inventory dollars down sequentially versus last quarter. In Q3, we had inventory growth of 16% year-over-year. Our decisive actions are enabling us to navigate through the shifting dynamics with continued improved efficiency. These results demonstrate yet again that we're on track to hit our fiscal '23 priorities of getting inventory in a healthy position and delivering revenue consistent with the financial goals we set earlier in the year. In an environment of increasing macro volatility, the distinction of our brands and our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy set NIKE apart. Looking ahead, CDA continues to unlock our future growth potential by powering up our holistic offense across innovation, brand engagement and marketplace, all fueled by consumer insight. As we know, consumers today have rising expectations and changing behaviors. What creates separation for NIKE in this dynamic environment is our innovative product, brand scale and direct connections we have with our consumers. It's these connections that serve as one of our greatest competitive advantages as we translate insight into innovation. Thanks to our consumers' love of our brand, we enjoy a high rate of engagement, fueling richer, deeper understanding. Across the company, our insights model creates confidence in growth in ways that are uniquely NIKE as we make the entire enterprise faster, more efficient and more targeted in the growth opportunities that we go after. So today, I thought we'd go through three areas where we leveraged our insights model this quarter. You may have heard us say before that running is the heart of NIKE and basketball is the soul. I'll discuss these two businesses, and then I'll talk about a product franchise that's a multibillion dollar business in its own right, Air Max. So first, let's start with Running. Since our founding, we've used elite athlete insight to innovate at the edges of human potential. And that's led to platforms like NEXT%, which remains at the front of the pack in the world of distance running. And then we use these insights and innovations to serve everyday consumers no matter where they are in their running journey. Today, we leverage our direct relationships with runners worldwide, fueled by insight from our Nike Run Club app, along with consumer feedback across brand and marketplace touch points to know how our consumers are using our product and what pain points we can solve to keep them moving. For example, we saw our Invincible consumers pushing more distance on their runs, which requires better support and protection. So this quarter, we introduced the Invincible 3, which is designed to provide maximum cushioning and comfort. It also offers a wider fit than some of our past running footwear and uses the most ZoomX foam of any of our road running shoes. It's a shoe that demonstrates how NIKE isn't just innovating for performance, but also designing to drive the lifestyle of running. Consumer response to the Invincible 3 was strong across our geos and throughout NIKE Direct, strategic wholesale partners and running specialty doors. And what really sets Invincible 3 apart is how we executed across the marketplace, driving consistent storytelling across channels, working closely with our partners to elevate our own retail presentation and theirs, all with a sharp focus on helping consumers find the right shoe for them. This approach will be accelerating as we focus on positioning ourselves for share gains in this important category. Our research with runners also leads us to launch product in complementary categories, such as trail running, which is our fastest-growing running segment. This fueled the launch in Q3 of the Pegasus Trail 4. The Peg Trail 4, which has seen over-indexing strength with female consumers, takes many of the well-loved attributes of the Peg and adds rugged features that let runners keep the pace even on looser terrain. The combination of React foam and underfoot traction has proven to be a perfect crossover shoe for runners looking to split time between road and trail. Thanks to our ability to use analytics and insight to discover opportunities for growth in running, we continue to connect to the grassroots of this global community, and we remain confident we can take full advantage of these opportunities over the long-term. Next, our Basketball category is in the strongest position it's ever been as we continue to grow the energy of the game globally. Across NIKE Basketball, Jordan Brand and Converse, we've strengthened our signature athlete portfolio, adding Gen Z superstars while still being anchored by some of the game's greatest players. Last month, LeBron James set the all-time NBA scoring record in a thrilling game in L.A. I was fortunate enough to be there with our Co-Founder, Phil Knight. After the game, Phil turned to me and said, that moments and athletes like this are why we got into this business, and he's right. And as I said last quarter, the LeBron 20 was the strongest LeBron launch in years, fueled by storytelling and the blend of innovation with sportswear design. This created greater commercial appeal, as seen in Q3 with very strong sell-through throughout the marketplace, in full family sizing. This is approach we use across the portfolio, across our Nike Basketball product construct.  Thanks to our ongoing dialogue with athletes from the elite to the everyday we design around three key aspects of the game : cutting fast, playing long and jumping high, all while emphasizing off-the-court style. So when we began work on a signature shoe for a playmaker and generational talent like Sabrina Ionescu, we knew the shoe would focus on cutting : helping her stop on a dime and accelerate back again. The Sabrina 1 uses research from thousands of athletes, both female and male, to create a unique traction pattern and a low-to-the-ground design that has lifestyle appeal that we\u2019re thrilled about. We\u2019re excited about the potential with the Sabrina 1, and the continued power of our increased focus on Women\u2019s coming out of CDA. Over in Jordan Brand, Q3 saw the release of its own young signature shoe. Jayson Tatum debuted the Tatum 1 last month at the NBA All-Star game with fireworks, breaking the all-star record for points scored. The Tatum 1 joins the Luka, Zion, Westbrook and Game Shoe franchises for the strongest signature portfolio in Jordan Brand's history, helping fuel robust growth for the brand alongside of its consistent strength in retro. Crafted with efficiency in mind, the Tatum 1 is Jordan Brand's lightest basketball shoe and has a large volume Zoom Air bag in the forefront for energy-returning stability. Special care was given to the Tatum 1 Kids design. The kids-specific model has specialized zonal rubber on the outsole for the durability needed for young kid's style of play. But the biggest innovation in the kids design came directly from parents, including Jayson himself, who asked for an easy-on, easy-off system. In preschool and grade school versions, designers came up with a new innovative tailgate system. And in toddler sizing, there's an even simpler collapsible entry technology. The Tatum 1 represents an evolution for the Jordan Brand, shifting from serving in an individual athlete to also serving the next generation to come as well. The potential here to bring innovation into our kids business is vast as we build lifelong relationships with younger generations. Third, let's discuss NIKE's Air Max franchise. Our Air Max business continues to expand, growing double digits in Q3. Like Air Jordan, Air Max is a great example of how we build significantly scaled businesses off our greatest performance innovations. Looking again at our Insights model, Air Max also exemplifies how we brief new product by leveraging qualitative and quantitative member data science to have a sharper and more targeted focus. We're able to ask ourselves, who are the consumers we want to serve and what are they looking for. For example, the 270 has been a top 5 Air Max franchise for the past five years. But we heard from younger age groups that they want their own version, a more street-engineered durable shoe, one with a new lifestyle identity. This vision of building a future franchise for the next generation led us to create the Air Max Pulse with the broader goal of creating an entire portfolio of Classics for this generation. The Pulse connects the 270 style Air bag with a brand-new upper, bold and versatile styling and new Air Max branding. The Pulse launches on Air Max Day next week, and we can't wait for consumers to give it a try. Another Air Max model launching next week is the Design by Japan Air Max 1 '87. This women's exclusive model represents the first time our members influence product creation using polling on the SNKRS App as well as local member polling data. With just a year from conception to delivery, we relied on our Express Lane capabilities to make and deliver the product in such a short turnaround. Members who participated will be the first targeted for the shoe, creating NIKE's first full circle insights-to-shopping experience. And this is only the first example of this kind of product creation, and we look forward to seeing what we can do next. Overall, we're excited by how our focused approach to insights will fuel future growth. We're still in the early innings, and we're thrilled by the possibility ahead of us as we stay dedicated to listening to the athlete and leveraging membership data to inform future products and consumer experiences. Before I close, I want to mention that in two days, on March 23, we'll release our fiscal '22 Impact report. As you know, at NIKE, purpose is deeply ingrained in everything we do. For example, you read that we've given more than 375,000 girls expanded access to sport through our community partners. In addition, we've maintained one-to-one pay equity for women and U.S. racial and ethnic minorities internally, while also helping the first of our suppliers' facilities achieve a gender equitable workplace with upward mobility for women. As you recall, two years ago, we set new quantifiable ESG targets, focusing on a wide range of priorities across people, planet and play. I encourage everyone to learn about the measurable progress we've made at purpose.nike.com as we continue to create long-term value by shaping a better future through sport. In the end, we're redefining what's possible, thanks to our close connections with consumers and how those relationships make us better again and again. We're supercharging how we serve athletes around the world with innovative product, brand engagement and experiences at retail. This promises to be yet another incredible year for sport and there's never been a better time to be in the business we're in. I could not be more excited about our future.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Matthew Friend : Thanks, John, and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE's third quarter showed that in a dynamic environment, strong brands set the pace. Two quarters ago, we took clear and decisive action in response to changing marketplace and supply chain conditions. Our top priority was to strategically manage excess inventory and drive a quicker return to a healthy pull market, and our Q3 results prove that NIKE is leading the way. NIKE is more agile, responsive and resilient than before the pandemic with operational capabilities and an experienced team that enable us to create competitive separation. While we may continue to face heightened volatility, we are confident in our ability to drive sustainable and more profitable growth. Consumer demand for our portfolio of brands remains uniquely strong, fueling unit growth of approximately 10% despite increased macro uncertainty. NIKE, Jordan and Converse, all drove double-digit currency-neutral growth this quarter. NIKE Direct outperformed with member buying frequency increasing and store sales growing across all geographies. Another quarter of industry-leading digital growth, up 24% in Q3, drove our digital share of business up to 27%. Our wholesale channel delivered a second straight quarter of outsized growth with a planned recapture of retail partner open to buy on improved inventory supply versus the prior year and strong consumer sell-through. Revenue from performance dimensions grew double digits versus the prior year with strong momentum from the Phantom GX, Invincible 3, LeBron 20 and other new product innovations. Revenue from lifestyle dimensions also remained strong as consumers continue to shift wallet share towards sport-inspired products that provide innovation, comfort and style. NIKE has been fueling this shift for more than 50 years, built on our passion for serving athletes. We have created the lifestyle around sport and have forged a deep connection to youth culture through our most iconic footwear franchises. Time and again, we take the consumer somewhere new. This quarter, we introduced new iterations of the Air Force 1 with Tiffany's Undefeated and Drake. We drove energy around our top Jordan franchises with our latest Travis Scott AJ1 and a women's exclusive AJ4. We welcomed the Year of the Rabbit with a Dunk inspired by the iconic White Rabbit candy. We celebrated the NBA All-Star Game with an Air Force 1, Dunk and Blazer collection inspired by its host city. And we connected consumers to the Air Max 1 through craftsmanship, heritage storytelling and new modern renditions. The energy that we are creating for the consumer continues to set NIKE apart. Even in a promotional environment, full price sales remain strong. And for the seventh consecutive quarter, ASP growth was positive for NIKE, Inc. with benefits from strategic pricing, product mix and our shift to direct more than offsetting the short-term cost of promotions to liquidate excess inventory. In addition to driving strong top line results, we are making tremendous progress on inventory. Let me walk through a few key points. First, inventory dollars and units are down meaningfully from last quarter. In the third quarter, total inventory dollar growth was 16% year-over-year. In North America, inventory dollar growth was 14%. In Greater China, inventory dollars declined 4% versus the prior year, positioning us well for the momentum that we are creating in the China marketplace. Next, we are making even greater progress where we are focused most. In Q3, total apparel units were down year-over-year as we continue our sharp focus on liquidating excess apparel inventory. In North America, apparel units were down high single digits. Finally, we are confident looking ahead with strong traffic and retail sales growth and reduced inventory buys for the spring and summer seasons, we are increasingly confident that we will exit the year with healthy inventories across the marketplace. In fact, given our brand momentum, we now intend to move through even more units by year-end than we had previously considered. Both transit and buying time lines continue to tighten towards pre-pandemic levels, and free cash flow accelerated this quarter through improvements in working capital. Along with an improving flow of seasonal supply, our decisive actions will enable NIKE to compete at its best, driving consumer energy through new product, seasonally relevant assortments and fresh storytelling and premium retail experiences. Regardless of the near-term uncertainty facing consumers, we will be prepared to lead and to operate from a position of strength. Now let me turn to our NIKE Inc. third quarter financial results. In Q3, NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 14% and 19% on a currency-neutral basis, with broad-based growth across brands, channels and geographies. NIKE Direct grew 22%, led by 24% growth in NIKE Digital and 19% growth in NIKE stores. Wholesale grew by 18%, driven by strong partner demand based on accelerating retail sales, higher shipments based on earlier supply availability and lower shipments in the prior year given supply constraints. Third quarter reported gross margins declined 330 basis points to 43.3% due to higher markdowns, increased product input costs, elevated freight and logistics expenses, including higher supply chain network costs in North America, partially offset by strategic pricing actions. This also includes approximately 140 basis points of impact from unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates. SG&A grew 15% in Q3, primarily due to wage-related expenses, variable NIKE Direct costs and increased demand creation expenses. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16% and substantially consistent to the same period as last year. Third quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.79. Now let's review the operating segment results. In North America, we drove strong holiday sales with momentum continuing into the new calendar year. Q3 revenue grew 27% on a currency-neutral basis, with NIKE Direct up 23% and NIKE Digital up 25%. EBIT grew 23% on a reported basis. Consumer demand drove strong growth across performance and lifestyle. LeBron, Giannis and Luka grew high double digits, fueling market share gains in basketball. A strong Invincible 3 launch energized the marketplace, doubling digital sales compared to the Invincible 2. Air Max grew double digits, and the Jordan Brand kicked off its 23rd year, also known as Jordan Year with strong double-digit growth, incredible momentum, especially with women consumers and even greater potential with a path toward becoming the #2 footwear brand in North America. Across the marketplace, we continue to capture opportunity with our growing digital advantage. Member moments throughout the quarter drove double-digit growth in repeat member buying. On the NIKE app, we integrated personalized product recommendations for members using available inventory to increase sell-through of key products. In addition, return on ad spend improved for another quarter as we test personalization and consumer experiences with activity and preference data. In EMEA, we saw strong growth across all Western European markets, including positive trends in the UK. Q3 revenue grew 26% on a currency-neutral basis, with NIKE Direct up 39% and NIKE Digital up 43%. EBIT grew 10% on a reported basis. New product innovation resonated deeply. Invincible 3 drove strong sell-through in NIKE Direct and with our retail partners. Our statement Go Leggings delivered positive early results with strong sales in NIKE Live and NIKE Rise Doors where we've been able to create a unique retail experience for her. In football, we are gaining share with a very successful launch of the Phantom GX plus sustained momentum in the Mercurial franchise. We saw strong consumer response as we continue to transform the consumer journey in Digital. Traffic grew double digits with average order value growing mid-single digits, and NIKE.com leading new member acquisition. On the NIKE App, member engagement grew double digits with the new Jordan member home button driving the highest click-through rate ever on the app. We also continue to drive convenience and improve NIKE Digital profitability by expanding O2O services, optimizing last-mile delivery and reducing digital split shipments. In Greater China, we drove top line growth despite another quarter of volatility. Q3 revenue grew 1% on a currency-neutral basis, declining 8% on a reported basis. NIKE Direct grew 3% on a currency-neutral basis with NIKE Digital declining 11% as consumer buying shifted to brick-and-mortar with the countries reopening. EBIT declined 10% on a reported basis. In December, we managed through disruption from the country's shift in COVID policies with widespread door closures. Starting in January, we began to see a rebound in brick-and-mortar traffic with strong retail momentum around Chinese New Year, accelerating into February, especially as our clean inventory position enabled us to serve consumers with fresh seasonal assortments. Throughout the quarter, we gained traction in some of our most important business dimensions : performance footwear outpace lifestyle with running up double digits, led by the Invincible 3. Meanwhile, in basketball, LeBron 20 and the GT Series resonated deeply with energy around our local Space Maker Summit and Jordan Brand's China High School Basketball League All-Star Weekend. Growth in kids surpassed other consumer segments with positive response to Hyperlocal collections, such as our Chinese New Year Leap High Express Lane pack. We are optimistic as our business momentum continues to build. In Beijing, NIKE's brand strength is deepening, extending our lead as the #1 cool and favorite brand. We are also seeing the benefits of a more local operating model as we have made investments over the past two years to serve the marketplace's unique needs. Long term, we are confident that the fundamentals of growth for NIKE in China remains strong. Finally, in APLA, NIKE's brand momentum continues to fuel strong growth. Q3 revenue grew 15% on a currency-neutral basis, including approximately 8 percentage points of headwind due to the first full quarter of impact from the transition of our Chile, Argentina and Uruguay businesses to a distributor model. NIKE Direct was up 22% with NIKE Digital growing 23%. EBIT grew 1% on a reported basis. Football grew double digits with a successful Phantom GX launch, strong sales for the Men's World Cup in December, and excitement building for the Women's World Cup this summer. In Running, we saw strong momentum across our top footwear franchises, including double-digit growth for Invincible, Infinity and Pegasus. And in fitness, the Metcon Free continues to win with consumers, growing triple digits. We also continue to accelerate opportunity in this geography through marketplace innovation. This quarter, we expanded Express Lane to bring more Hyperlocal product to consumers. In March, we introduced the NIKE App in Korea, which launched as the #1 free shopping app in one of our most digitally connected markets. And later this week, we'll open our newest World of Flight door in Tokyo, expanding the Jordan Brand's international growth. I will now turn to our financial outlook for fiscal '23. To date, we continue to see uniquely strong consumer demand as our product innovation, brand storytelling and consumer connections drive distinction and growth in the marketplace. That being said, we are closely monitoring the building pressure on consumer confidence and the uncertainties of the macro environment. We continue to take a cautious approach in planning our business, leading with intentional financial and operational guardrails. And looking ahead, we will continue to transform our operating model, unlocking speed, agility and efficiency with an improved marginal cost of growth. As a result of our strong Q3 performance, we now expect fiscal '23 reported revenue to grow high single digits, an improvement from mid-single-digit guidance in the prior quarter with approximately 600 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. For the fourth quarter, this translates into flat to low single-digit revenue growth. Remember, more than six months ago, we strategically reduced our inventory commitments for the spring and summer seasons to ensure that both NIKE and our partners can work through excess and early arriving inventory. As a result, we expect wholesale revenue growth to moderate for the next few quarters. We expect fiscal '23 gross margin to decline approximately 250 basis points at the low end of our previous guidance range. This reflects ongoing and accelerated actions to reduce inventory by year-end, elevated freight and logistics expenses, including higher supply chain network costs in North America and 100 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. For the full year, we expect SG&A to grow approximately 10%. We continue to expect our tax rate to be in the high teens range. And consistent with my approach over the past few years, I will provide specific guidance for fiscal '24 on our next earnings call. In this environment, what sets NIKE apart is our portfolio of leading brands, our proven playbook and a team and culture of innovation that continues to deliver. We have managed through cycles like this before, and we will be well prepared for the volatility that is in front of us. With that, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Matthew Boss, JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Great. Thanks. Congrats on a very nice quarter and progression with all of your priorities. So John, maybe as you break down underlying drivers of the current business momentum, could you just speak to market share acceleration opportunities that you see across running, basketball and women's? As from your tone, the forward-looking product pipeline sounds pretty robust. And then just, Matt, with increased confidence in the inventory on track to finish the year in a healthy position, help us to think about the timing or magnitude of margin headwinds from this year turning to tailwinds as we look forward? John Donahoe : Yes. Matt, so we feel very good about our ability to accelerate share in each of the three areas you mentioned and more broadly, and we feel very good about our product pipeline. Let me just briefly touch on the three areas you mentioned. Just -- let me start with running. As you know, we segment running into three segments based on consumer insights : Racing, where we continue to dominate Race Day with the NEXT% platform; Trail, where we're gaining share as we speak with shoes such as the Peg Trail 4 and other very innovative models. And then in road racing, as you know, we've really refocused over the past six to 12 months around six models. And in Q3, we launched the Invincible 3, which both Matt and I mentioned, was very well received in all four geographies across all of our channels, our direct channels, wholesale partners like DICK'S as well as running specialty doors. And so the Invincible which was just launched, we see a lot of legs left with Invincible in the coming quarters and years. And then in the next six to 12 months, we'll do major updates to the other five road running models, where we're taking some of the innovations from our racing platform, putting them in for everyday runners, very strong innovations around foams and other materials. So running is a very important priority for us, and we see some share gains currently and in road running a lot of focus in the coming six to 12 to 18 months. Basketball, as I mentioned in my remarks, our signature portfolio, I don't think it's ever been stronger, and it's refreshed. You take LeBron, Giannis, KD, new next-gen stars like Ja, Devin Booker, Sabrina. In Jordan, we've got Zion, Luka, Tatum. And by the way, the return of the Kobe. And then our GT Series will have major updates in each of the run, cut and jump silos. So our basketball portfolio is almost an embarrassment of riches that we want to continue driving through the marketplace in the coming six to 12 months. And then women's, we're really encouraged by early reception of Go and Zenvy and Alate, the Go and Zenvy Leggings, the Alate bras. And we're encouraged by the pipeline. In fact, coincidentally, this week, we've got several hundred of our global leaders on campus, planning our spring '24 season, which is, in essence, January through March of next year, next calendar year. And I've got to tell you the breadth and depth, while we can't talk about specifics now, the breadth and depth of the innovation pipeline is really strong. And what's clear is as we return to the office, as our teams are now back together in person, that NIKE magic of consumer insight driving product innovation, combined with storytelling, combined with the marketplace, is really picking up steam. So I'd say we're feeling very good about the future on the product pipeline front. Matthew Friend : And I'll just jump in that on inventory. We've made tremendous progress on inventory. And two quarters ago, you'll recall, we made clear -- set clear goals and decisive actions in response to changing conditions in the supply chain and the marketplace. And we've been able to leverage our brand momentum into and through the holiday season and continue to be able to sustain it into spring. And we're increasingly confident that we're going to exit fiscal year '23 with healthy inventory levels across the marketplace, across channels in the marketplace. And in fact, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that within the financial parameters that we had set two quarters ago, we're going to exit with even leaner inventory than we had anticipated given the momentum that we're seeing. As it relates to the impact on gross margins and fiscal year '24, I mentioned that next quarter I'll provide full and complete guidance. But what I will tell you is that we've been talking about 350 basis points of transitory cost headwinds in our gross margins over the past two years between elevated ocean freight and logistics and then the promotions required to move through excess and early arriving inventory. And we expect that those transitory headwinds will begin to recover in fiscal year '24, and I'll give specific guidance about how much next quarter. Operator : Next, we'll take a question from Omar Saad, Evercore Partners. Omar Saad : I'd love to ask my question on China. Maybe you could dive in a little bit deeper on the outlook for the recovery there, maybe across a few different dimensions, being the consumer recovery, how the consumer is behaving, what you're seeing there, the competitive landscape, especially vis-a-vis locals, which may have taken some share. And then also the marketing landscape. Are you having unfettered access to all the different marketing channels that you need to resonate with the consumers? John Donahoe : Yes, Omar, bottom line is we feel good about our momentum in China. And that's both Q3, where you saw in a post-lockdown environment, growth really pick up the second month of the quarter, and our inventory is in a very healthy position. But even more importantly, and to the -- some of your specifics, we look going forward, the fundamentals of this market are good, right? It is a large -- it is a very large market that's growing. Sport and wellness is a key trend and tailwind there. There's a desire for innovation and style. And the key to winning in this market is, simply put, having great innovation and connecting with Chinese consumers in a locally relevant way. And so that's what we're doing. On the great innovation front, our product innovation is resonating with the Chinese consumer, and it's a nice blend of global platforms like the LeBron 20, the G.T. Cut, which, by the way, was very well received in China, the Invincible, our lifestyle franchises, along with hyperlocal innovations through our gel of the examples will be the Chinese New Year pack, or we did a Year of the Rabbit pack focused on Gen Z and Gen Alpha that's really resonating with that constituency, and we're really focused on those younger consumers in China. And our brand strength, I think Matt mentioned this in his remarks, growing. We're #1 cool and favorite brand. That gap widened in Q3 in Beijing. And it's an environment where 6,000 monobrand stores are a real advantage. And so we're going to continue to invest in China for China. We have a great team there. We were delighted that they were able to come -- we got to see them in person for the first time this quarter in 3 years, and they are very optimistic and excited about our future. We're building, as you talk about, hyperlocal product and storytelling ability. And that enables us to, for the first time, we have locally driven apps there and our ability to do rapid storytelling there. And our tech stack is increasingly China for China. So there's really not been a time when we can serve consumers in China in a more agile and personalized way. And that is helping our competitive position in China. So we're very focused on it and very -- feel very good about our momentum. Matthew Friend : Yes. And Omar, I just would add on some of the monthly trends that I commented on in my script that in December, we talked about the shift in COVID policy and the impact that, that had both on the amount of doors that were open in retail traffic. And our business in December was down high single digits. We flipped to growth in January, and we saw a rebound in brick-and-mortar traffic and strong retail sales performance. And then in the month of February, we saw our momentum accelerate even further relative to January, and that\u2019s with comping the nine-month comp of Lunar New Year in the prior year. So when we look at our inventory position being down again this year versus -- or this quarter, I should say, versus prior year for the second straight quarter, the fundamentals are there for us to continue the momentum that we've been talking about for several quarters. And we absolutely expect that China continues to be a growth opportunity for NIKE. Operator : Your next question call comes from Paul Lejuez, Citigroup. Paul Lejuez : Thanks, guys. Paul Lejuez. Can you give us an update on your shared apps and the partnerships that you've developed with certain retailers? Are they progressing as planned? And what are your thoughts on linking up with any new partners in the future? John Donahoe : Yes, Paul, as you know, our whole marketplace strategy is to allow consumers to get what they want when they want, how they want it across our own digital, across our own retail and across our wholesale partners, all tied together with our membership program, which is 150 million active members. And this notion of connected membership with our wholesale partners is really beginning to bear fruit. And some of the early examples with, let's say, DICK'S, you're seeing examples where we can provide a personalized experience to a shared NIKE and DICK'S member in a way they can't get elsewhere that benefits us and benefits DICK'S. A simple example might be, I guess, baseball season is about to be upon us. And so we can find a baseball consumer -- a DICK'S consumer is a baseball consumer, and we can send an e-mail focused on NIKE's baseball cleats, along with DICK'S, a bat and a mitt. And consumers are responding to that very personalized messaging from NIKE and DICK's. And so clear, early positive benefits for both. I think our Chinese partners and JD and others are feeling the same. So we'll continue to expand that in a very thoughtful way with our other strategic wholesale partners. And again, I think it gives us a competitive advantage of being able to serve consumers across multiple channels and having the largest and most engaged membership program in the industry. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Straton, Morgan Stanley. Alexandra Straton : Great. And congrats on another really great quarter. I saw that you guys took the SG&A guide up a bit for the full year. So I'm just wondering, can you just review what's driving that? And should we think about that as moderating next year? Or what are your priorities going forward? Then just one quick second one. I think you mentioned numerous quarters of ASP growth that you guys have posted. How much pricing have you taken versus pre-COVID levels? And are you expecting to take more in the upcoming seasons? Or how should we think about that? Matthew Friend : Sure, Alex. Well, we wanted to sharpen our guidance as we finish this fiscal year. But maybe to take a step back for a second as it relates to SG&A, we started the year with an SG&A guide of high single digits to low double-digit growth. And at the end of the first quarter, when we saw the change in conditions, we decided that we were going to prioritize our efforts around inventory liquidation and getting back to a healthy pull market. And so what we said was that we were going to prioritize the investments that we've been making for several years in our consumer-led digital transformation, the capabilities and the ways of working that are enabling us to create a new operating model for NIKE. And we would manage expense growth tightly, and we would reduce our planned head count growth. And we've absolutely done that over the last two quarters and feel very good about the momentum that we've been making with regards to ensuring that our resources are flowing towards the priorities that we have. And we've got some exciting things that are going to land from a transformation perspective in the next six months. When you step back even further, our revenue guidance at that point in time was for low single-digit to mid-single-digit revenue growth. And given the brand momentum that we're seeing, our updated revenue guidance now being high single-digit revenue growth, I'm actually quite proud that we've been able to manage expense growth on a variable basis even as we've seen our revenue continue to increase. And that focus and attention on expense growth or managing expense growth and head count growth, we definitely intend to carry into our next fiscal year. As it relates to your question about ASPs and pricing, we've increased prices this year mid-single digits on average across our portfolio. As I think I've said in prior quarters, it wasn't a peanut butter across every product in style. It was a surgical approach, but on average, it averages out to mid-single-digit growth. As we look ahead to next year, we're absolutely continually looking at the profitability of our product, we're looking at inflationary costs in supply chain and also inflationary costs that are impacting the make of our product. And we will continue to focus on managing those levers together in order to try to drive profitable growth going forward. I'll give you more guidance next quarter on the specifics, but that's absolutely our strategy and the way that we've been managing product pricing and margin for many, many years. Operator : Bob Drbul from Guggenheim is up next. Robert Drbul : Just a couple of questions on inventory. You made a lot of progress with your numbers. Can you talk about two pieces I'm interested in, wholesale inventories, meaning at the wholesale level at your retail partners, where you see the channels, specifically in North America, maybe even in Europe. And then on the apparel side, that's been where you had a lot of excess inventory. Just wanted to understand your sort of learnings from working through all the apparel? And maybe you could give us an updated outlook on how you think apparel is positioned over the next few quarters in the pipeline there? Matthew Friend : Sure, Bob. Well, as it relates to inventories across the overall marketplace, when we set the actions that we put into place two quarters ago, that was across channels with partners and NIKE Direct. And given the momentum that we're seeing and the momentum that we saw from the holiday season heading into holiday and into spring, we had very specific plans with our partners in order to balance promotions across the marketplace in order to be able to move inventory on slower moving products and also, in particular, as it relates to apparel to be more aggressive in order to be able to address some of the late-arriving seasonal product, which was part of our challenge at the beginning. And we've made great progress on it. So when we look across our wholesale partners or the wholesale channel, I should say, North America and EMEA overall, and we look at the rate of sales that we're seeing in those channels, we feel very good about the progress that we and our partners have made. And in fact, this quarter, our retail sales to the consumer in the wholesale side was larger than our sell-in. So we feel very good about our progress there. As it relates to specifics in apparel, I think that one of the biggest learnings we had was after our factories closed in the fall or in the late summer and early fall of last year, we decided to continue to carry forward with making late product because there was so much constraint in the marketplace. And I think in hindsight, that was -- we would take a do-over on that one and focus on getting seasonally right product in front of the consumer. And what I would tell you is that the benefit of us moving so fast against the excess and early rising inventory that we've had is that we're now actually watching the timing of delivery of current season product up significantly versus prior quarters and now starting to rival the levels of deliveries that we were seeing in pre-pandemic. And so having the right assortment, the right colors, the right materials, the right stories at retail is NIKE, it creates competitive advantage for NIKE because we can pull the consumer experience together in a way that is very difficult to match. John Donahoe : Yes, I'll just build on that. The learning is, don't have a supply chain crisis in a highly seasonal business. But I referenced earlier, Matt and I were overseeing our spring '24. Again, that's six months -- six to nine months away. And you just see when you have the right assortments in apparel and the right colors coming together in the right way, it's very powerful. And so the pipeline there looks very exciting. Operator : Your next question comes from Aneesha Sherman, Bernstein. Aneesha Sherman : I'm curious to know a little bit more about your trends through the quarter in China. I know you talked about December being a really tough month. Would it be possible for you to talk about December versus 2023 in terms of how the quarter behaved and possibly the exit rate out of the quarter so we can get a sense of how demand is trending at the moment? And then I have a second question around your sales guidance. Your sales guidance implies about flat quarter-over-quarter between Q4 versus Q3. Are you expecting inventory to be down kind of similarly to this quarter, so down a few percent quarter-over-quarter on a flat sales base? Matthew Friend : Sure, Aneesha. I mentioned earlier in response to Omar's question, the monthly trends in China, but I'll just hit it again quickly. With the door closures and retail traffic under pressure and the shift of COVID policy in December, our business was down high single digits. We flipped to growth year-over-year in the month of January and saw an improvement in brick-and-mortar traffic in China. And then in the month of February, we saw an even greater improvement relative to January. And that includes lapping the Lunar New Year period in the prior year because it was in a different month. So we are encouraged. I mentioned that our inventory levels are healthy there. And so we're encouraged based on the momentum that we had as we exited the quarter. As it relates to our full year revenue guidance. We revised our full year revenue guidance again upward, and that was based on strong momentum this month -- this quarter. But also when I look at Q4 in particular, our fourth quarter outlook at this point in time is higher than it has been in the previous two quarters. So we're continuing to see our brand momentum and our confidence continue to build. The largest driver of our Q4 revenue guidance is six months ago, we made the decision to cut our spring and summer buys to help ensure that we finish this fiscal year in a healthy place from an inventory perspective that we and our partners finish this year in a healthy place from an inventory perspective. And we're making great progress against that. So we expect to continue to see improvement in Q4 in our inventory and are confident that we're going to finish this year in a position of strength as we look ahead to fiscal year '24. Operator : We'll take our next question from Kate Fitzsimons, Wells Fargo. Kate Fitzsimons : Curious if you can just expand on some of the movement we've seen in digital margins over the last couple of quarters. Sounds like you continue to see benefits associated with reduced digital shipments. It seems like you're pleased with some of the movement on the ROAS front. So I'm curious now if you can just kind of speak to more detail about the margin delta maybe you're seeing between the wholesale and direct channels. And just how should we think about the digital margin flow through at this point? Matthew Friend : Sure. Well, we've been talking for some time about the -- how our consumer-led digital transformation is transforming NIKE's financial model. And you really see it both in terms of revenue and in gross margin. And if you look at the momentum that we've been driving from a top line perspective, I would say that we've benefited from roughly 3 points of benefit related to a higher mix of business going through our digital and our direct channels. And you can see that not only in the algorithm that we provided around high single digit to low double-digit growth, but just looking at our ASP performance and the continued momentum that we're seeing as digital goes from being about 9% of our business in fiscal year '19 to exiting this quarter at 27% of our mix of business. We've always said that the margin contribution from our digital business is higher than the wholesale channels. And that had fueled gross margin expansion from fiscal year '19 to fiscal year '22. And as we look at some of the dynamics that I referenced on the call this quarter, what I was really trying to highlight is that not only is the channel mix a tailwind for us as we grow our digital business, but we actually think there's opportunities for us to improve the profitability of the digital channel. And those two examples that I gave this quarter really were intended to reflect that. One, we talked specifically in EMEA about some of the efforts that the team is making to lower our fulfillment cost from a digital perspective through O2O, through reducing split shipments and adding pickup points. And then on the membership and marketing side, the idea that if we've got more members coming in through the top of the funnel who are more engaged and buying more frequently, we should start to see an improvement in our ROAS or return on ad spend from a digital perspective and give us a lot of confidence that we're building a moat to be able to continue to serve and grow our digital business. So those are two examples, in particular, of us working hard to improve even greater the profitability of our digital channel. I think as we look longer term, we remain confident in our ability to continue to drive towards the long-term goals that we've provided. Obviously, this year, we've seen higher markdowns and promotions in our direct channels as we've been moving through excess inventory, but we think those are transitory costs, and we should begin to see the recovery of those beginning in fiscal year '24. Paul Trussell : We have time for one last question. Operator : That question will come from Gaby Carbone, Deutsche Bank. Gabriella Carbone : My question is on EMEA. Curious if you can dig into what you're seeing in the region? It seems like it continues to be quite resilient despite the macro environment. But are you seeing any meaningful differences between countries? John Donahoe : I mean I'd just say a broad statement, and then Matt, you can fill in some of the specifics. The EMEA consumer has held up remarkably well. And what's clear is our brand strength has really strong across demand. That's both for NIKE and Jordan. You saw really strong across channels, digital, very strong this entire year as well as this quarter as well as our direct and wholesale channels. So the brand connection with NIKE across our major fields of play across NIKE and Jordan is as strong there as it is anywhere. Matthew Friend : Yes. And I just would add that we're running a complete offense in that marketplace, and we've seen strong growth across brands, across performance and lifestyle, across different genders, sport dimensions, up and down price points. I mean we're -- that team is doing a phenomenal job running a complete offense there. And when we look across the country portfolio, several quarters ago, we had highlighted some softness in the UK, but we're continuing to see strong growth across all of our Western European markets and including the UK, which has bounced back. And so as we look at the dynamics that John referenced, we're continuing to focus on driving authenticity for the brand through sport and in lifestyle in that important region. And I'll be honest with you, a lot of things that resonate and incorporate and sneaker culture around the world find their place starting in the Europe market. And so our closeness to the consumer in that market is critical not just to drive growth in that region, but to drive trends and behavior in markets outside of that region. Paul Trussell : Thanks for the question, Gaby, and thank you all for participating in our Q3 earnings call. This concludes the conference call for today. We'll talk to you next time. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, everyone. Once again, that does conclude this call. You may now disconnect.",

For those who want to reference today's press release, you'll find it at investors.nike.com. Leading today's call is Paul Trussell, VP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Trussell. Please go ahead. Paul Trussell : Thank you, operator. Hello everyone, and thank you for joining today to discuss NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal 2023 fourth quarter results. Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe; and our Chief Financial Officer, Matt Friend. Before we begin, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in NIKE\u2019s reports filed with the SEC. In addition, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures and non-public financial and statistical information. Please refer to NIKE\u2019s earnings press release or NIKE\u2019s website investors.nike.com for comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations. All growth comparisons on the call today are presented on a year-over-year basis and our currency neutral unless otherwise noted. We will start with prepared remarks and then open up for questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial question to one. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I will now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc., President and CEO, John Donahoe. John Donahoe : Thank you, Paul, and hello to everyone on today's call. Fiscal 2023 was a milestone year for NIKE as we set new records while delivering on our operational and financial goals. It's clear that our strategy is working, and that NIKE's unique advantages continue to drive competitive separation. Looking at our results, we exceeded $50 billion in revenue, with growth of 16% on the year. This growth is broad based across our consumer construct of men's, women's, and kids, across performance and lifestyle and across all geographies. North America, EMEA, and APLA all saw full-year double-digit growth and Greater China returned to double-digit growth in Q4. We're also driving strength through our interesting-leading brand portfolio with NIKE, Jordan, and Converse, all of which achieved strong growth in fiscal 2023. In particular, I want to highlight Jordan's brand's record year. Jordan grew mid-30s with impressive growth across men's, women's, and kids, footwear and apparel and in both North America and International. In fact, Jordan is well on its way to becoming the second largest footwear brand in North America. And last but not least, we return to healthy inventory ahead of our competition. Our inventory is flat year-over-year in value and down in units versus 12 months ago. The actions we've taken position us for more profitable growth moving forward. Across our business, we continue to build a marketplace that addresses how consumers want to be served giving them what they want, when they want it, and how they want it. NIKE creates distinction across the marketplace by segmenting consumer experiences to drive deep direct connections with consumers and grow the marketplace. Today in the industry with digital and physical growth converging, we've accelerated investment to create a truly distinctive digital experience through our own platforms. Every year, we serve traffic in the billions, which delivers strong digital growth as both conversion rate and average order value continue to improve. This success helped increase the digital share of our business to 26% in fiscal 2023 as compared to 10% in fiscal 2019. For the year, we had strong digital growth of 24% and we expect digital to continue to lead our growth. Now, this is all powered by our membership offense. We know our consumers better and are better able to serve them with data driven insights fueling our end-to-end value chain, including product creation, marketing, and merchandising. This is translating into sustainable and profitable growth for NIKE, and we believe this growth will only accelerate as we add new capabilities built to serve consumers at scale. In fiscal 2023, we expanded our membership base, but more importantly, we elevated and deepened these consumer relationships. Our members now engage with us more frequently, buy more, and are more loyal to our brands. Once members join our ecosystem, they are increasing their lifelong sport journeys with us. Now of course, NIKE members also shop across marketplace channels. And so, as we grow, we're always actively managing our marketplace to serve consumers with expanded choice, access, and convenience. We think about our multi-brand partners in three complementary groups that each serve distinct needs. First, as you know, over the past five years, we've created greater focus and differentiation working with fewer large multi-brand partners. These partners have the scale to invest in retail experiences and connected digital membership to drive long-term growth. Second, we've also sharpened our commitment to neighborhood, authenticators in both sport and lifestyle to drive energy and validate our brand. This investment in community ensures brand access, as well as deep local consumer connection. And third, we partner with accounts that help us provide access to consumers across different segments and price points. And at the same time, we continue to invest in NIKE store concepts that create new distribution and serve growth opportunities not currently being addressed by our wholesale partners. The recent unveiling of our NIKE Well Collective, which responds to deep insight from our female consumers, [rebrand] [ph] NIKE Live, and creates an elevated approach to retail. NIKE Well Collective brings new energy and sharpens our focus on serving the opportunity we see with women. So, this is how our consumer direct acceleration strategy drives the future of the marketplace, a seamless member led experience that addresses the opportunities as we see them across the consumer landscape. Last month, I was in Shanghai and Beijing, and I was blown away by how the entire marketplace experience comes to live there. Our Greater China team is building a connected and seamless journey across digital and physical, commerce and social, owned and partner doors. And I will tell you the merchandising is best-in-class. You can just feel the energy of our brand and our product. And with our record-breaking performance during this year's 6/18 shopping holiday, in which we were the number one sports brand on Tmall, I'm even more confident in our playbook and strategy in China. Today, we're excited and confident with the opportunity we see in front of us. And looking to fiscal 2024 and beyond, we will continue to expand our competitive separation. To that end, this quarter, we made some shifts within our senior leadership team that will further deepen our growth and accelerate our marketplace advantage, elevating Heidi Oneill and Craig Williams to become NIKE Brands' two Presidents. Heidi and Craig are both incredible leaders with long track records of driving growth and results. And their new roles are designed to drive an even greater focus on innovation and integration for our business. These changes will streamline our efforts across product, brand storytelling, and marketplace. I will tell you, I'm thrilled and I can also tell you that their teams are thrilled as well for the kind of growth we'll be able to achieve under this new simplified structure. For the remainder of my remarks today, I want to walk you through something that defines everything we do and that's sport. Sport is who we are. It will always be our differentiator. No brand can grow the world of sport, like NIKE. No brand connects people to sport by putting all of the pieces together like we can. We stay in the lead because we combine innovation, brand, and the culture of sport and do it all at global scale. This is the power of our strategy. We're able to both unleash athlete potential and create the lifestyle of sport around the globe. Where other brands strive to grow their slice of the pie, we're able to grow the pie itself. Let me walk through three areas where we have expanded the world of sport and where we see even greater opportunity ahead. First, let's discuss Global Football. In fiscal 2023, Global Football grew 25%, nearly doubling overall NIKE growth. With women's and kids' businesses growing even faster, key boot franchises like Mercurial and Phantom, saw high full price realization as we continue to win share on pitch. We invest in the grassroots of the game, while also partnering with the sports\u2019 greatest. Erling Haaland joined our roster this quarter as his record pace of goal scoring cements his step on the future of the game, and we can't wait for this summer's World Cup. NIKE is proud to partner with more federations in the tournament than any other brand, and we've matched that energy with our most comprehensive women's football collection ever. For example, we'll watch the most innovative woman's led football boot in our history. After more than two years of testing and designing, the new Phantom Luna boot features a proprietary cleat pattern that provides [peak traction] [ph] and stability for female players. In addition, our World Cup kits will debut significant fit and material innovations mapped to a woman's specific movements. And last but not least, we've created our largest ever football inspired sportswear collection. For both fans and athletes, when they're off pitch. We're just weeks out from the tournament and we're focused and aligned to drive energy like no one else as we connect the next generation of fans to the world\u2019s most popular sport. Next, let's discuss basketball, where we continue to see significant market leadership. Today, NIKE defines basketball. And as we look at landscape, we see only expanding competitive separation ahead. Our influence in basketball is elevated by the strength of our portfolio of brands, NIKE, Jordan, and Converse. In fact, our roster, which is already the game's greatest, set a new standard this season. For the first time ever, all three of our brands were represented in the All-NBA first team. With Luca and Jason from Jordan, Giannis from Nike, and Rising Star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander from Converse. This is an unprecedented accomplishment. And speaking of the game's greatest, fiscal 2023 marked 20 years of LeBron\u2019s signature shoe. We're excited by the continued potential of the LeBron business as his brand reaches a new dimension by bringing back earlier styles onto the court, igniting new energy for these retro models with consumers. And in addition, the Sabrina 1 is resonating strongly since launch, helping double our WNBA business versus what it was two short years ago. It's going to be an exciting summer, as we set the stage to relaunch the Kobe brand in advance of Kobe Day on 8/24. And as you know, it's already been a great few months for basketball. We had a thrilling NBA season, which concluded with Nikola Joki\u0107 taking the Denver Nuggets to their first ever title. The WNBA season kicked off with Brittney Griner making her return to the court. And earlier this week, A'ja Wilson was named an All-Star team captain. And in China, 10x Chinese Basketball Association All-Star point guard, Guo Ailun won his third CBA Championship. And earlier this week, in fact, last week in the NBA draft, Victor Wembanyama was selected number 1 overall by the San Antonio Spurs. We're thrilled to have Victor in the NIKE family, and we're excited for what the future holds in basketball. Now, I want to take a minute to go a little bit deeper into the Jordan brand. Jordan's greatest advantage is its authenticity and connection to sport, which drives a special bond with generation upon generation. This brand has built a cultural identity that transcends the game, connecting people with deep emotion, and a sense of self belief. If this authenticity that fuels Jordan's leadership and streetwear, Jordan continues to dictate the conversation by being a premium brand [that drives] [ph] sportswear culture. You've seen this come to life through Jordan's partners across top culture, from product launches like the Women's Teyana Taylor AJ 1 High, to the brand's meaningful collaboration with the movie, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Today, Jordan is extending its core strength in men's. In Q4, Jordan launched the Tatum 1, which completes Jordan's Signature offense along with Luca, Zion, and the Game Shoe. With this foundation in place, Jordan has plans to now scale these four franchises even further. And at the same time, Jordan is building real energy around our biggest growth opportunities. In fiscal 2023, Jordan had over indexing growth in both women's and kid\u2019s alongside increasing strength in apparel. And today, Jordan's growth in performance footwear is now outpacing retro footwear, but no discussion of Jordan\u2019s opportunity would be complete with, also looking at its international business. In most of our geos, Jordan's penetration is about 10 points lower than it is in North America, and this is the growth opportunity we plan to capture moving ahead. Simply put, we continue to see a tremendous amount of potential for the Jordan brand and its differentiated ability to drive culture, connection, and growth like nothing else. Finally, let me comment on our running business. Running's been a competitive battlefield lately with more and more brands joining the market. And today, we're more aligned in resource to compete and win. We saw roughly 10% growth for our running footwear business in fiscal 2023, and we're just getting started. Now, as you know, NIKE's advantage in innovation is shown as we continue to set the pace in racing and trail running categories led by the new Vaporfly 3 and Peg Trail 4, respectively. And following a recent reset, we're prioritizing the needs of everyday runners through newness and consistency in the key styles they love most. For example, last quarter, we launched the Invincible 3, which continues to perform well. Since its Q3 launch, Invincible has already doubled its retail sales versus last year. And next quarter, we're debuting the Infinity Run 4, another major update to a popular franchise. In fact, I'm wearing a pair right now, and I have to say, they feel great. The Infinity 4\u2019s React X is our newest of them. A breakthrough innovation that's more sustainable and offers runners a smooth and responsive ride following years of women led testing. And this is just the start as we reinvigorate our running footwear line with more to be unveiled as we build momentum heading into the Olympics in Paris next summer. And in addition to innovating four runners, we're also driving the lifestyle of running as only NIKE can. The Vomero 5, which in fiscal 2023 kicked-off our strategic relaunch into the intersection of running and streetwear, has already become a staple of modern sneaker culture. The Vomero 5 is coming into the summer with a lot of momentum as we substantially increased its volume all-year. And just last month, we launched the Motiva. A walking shoe with a distinctive design at an attractive price point and one that's represented of the aggressive approach we're taking to opportunities we see in the market. In just two months post-launch, Motiva has had strong sell-through. particularly for women, already becoming a top 5 performance footwear style globally, a NIKE Digital. Ultimately, when we look at the full running business, while we know there's a lot of work ahead, we remain confident in our go forward strategy and firm in our belief that we're all set to compete with strengths. In the end, our CDA strategy is working. Our brands have strong energy. Our innovation pipeline is as relentless as ever, and we're executing against what matters most to consumers. And as we look at fiscal 2024, NIKE will occupy the same leadership position that we earned year after year as we usher our industry into the future. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Matt Friend : Thanks, John and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE is a growth company and fiscal 2023 demonstrated our ability to deliver strong growth in the midst of rapidly changing market conditions. Throughout the year, we drove competitive separation by doing what NIKE does best. Serve athletes with product innovation, and rich storytelling, amplify our brand voice through key sport and consumer moments, deepen consumer connections across our portfolio, and actively manage the marketplace to drive sustainable profitable growth. For the full-year, we delivered mid-teens revenue growth with accelerating momentum in our performance business and sustained strength and lifestyle. We added $7 billion of revenue in total on a currency neutral basis, which included adding $3 billion to North America, our largest most mature market. In addition, our top franchises drove strong full price sales with mid-single-digit price increases, and we grew units and ASP across both product engines. In Q4, we saw another quarter of strong consumer demand, with traffic growing online and in our stores and total retail sales across the marketplace up double-digits versus the prior year. Beyond driving strong top line growth, we finished the year with a significantly improved marketplace position, with total marketplace inventory units, including NIKE and our wholesale partners, down year-over-year. We feel very good about the results driven by our decisive actions over this past year, as well as the sales momentum that we continue to see from NIKE Direct and our top strategic partners, including DICK'S Sporting Goods, JD, Sports Direct, and our city specialty partners. To go a little deeper on inventory, NIKE Inc. inventory dollars are flat versus the prior year, with units down double-digits across both footwear and apparel. Apparel units are down more than 20% versus the prior year. Our mix of in-transit inventory has normalized, and days in inventory show improvement versus the prior quarter and the prior year. Closeout mix is in-line with pre-pandemic levels, with improvements in the average age of our closeout inventory versus the prior year. And from a geography perspective, both North America and Greater China have inventory dollars down high-single-digit versus the prior year, with units being down double-digits. All told, we are entering fiscal 2024 on our front foot, ready to navigate any uncertainty that may be ahead of us, and ready to compete from a position of strength. Now as we move forward, we are building on a strong foundation for future growth. Our confidence is grounded in the power of NIKE's portfolio. Deeply connected to the consumer, centered in sport and youth culture, fueling authenticity and distinction, unrivaled in breadth and depth. Our strength begins with our scale from our investment in innovation, to our sports marketing portfolio, our digital platforms and membership, and our global reach. We create value for consumers around the world, leveraging NIKE's scale and competitive advantages, to drive sustainable growth and strong returns to shareholders over the long-term. And today NIKE's opportunity to grow is as large as it's ever been. Consumer interest around the world in sport, health, and wellness has never been greater and what excites us most is the potential still ahead. Let me share just a few examples. First, one of NIKE's greatest competitive advantages is our relentless pace of innovation. We innovate to make athletes better, to serve more athletes, and to make the world better for athletes everywhere. And right now, in our LeBron James Innovation Center, we are creating new concepts, new platforms, and new capabilities to fuel NIKE's next 50 years of innovation and growth. We will continue to increase investment in innovation to create value for athletes, and this gives me confidence we can drive long-term growth for NIKE. We have some great opportunities over this next fiscal year to showcase our latest innovations on the global sports stage. Second, we're accelerating direct consumer relationships across our digital platforms. By better knowing and serving the consumers who love our brands, we are also unlocking strategic and financial benefits for NIKE. For example, we have partnered with Adobe to enable 1-to-1 member personalization, driving gains in member retention, click through rates, and conversion, resulting in higher demand per member and returns on digital ad spend. We're only beginning to operationalize these new capabilities and consumer experiences on our digital platforms and we see even greater opportunity to come. Third, we see meaningful growth potential in our international markets. This includes Korea, one of our most digitally connected markets, Central and South America, a region with a deep love of sport, Southeast Asia and India, with one of the world's largest youth populations. And, of course, China, where young consumers are seeking our top product innovation, and Gen Z is coming of age as the country's most active generation ever. Last, we can now see around the corner on the transitory cost headwinds that pressured profitability in fiscal 2022 and 2023. When combined with our structural opportunities to improve profitability as we grow, we are confident that we will deliver above average margin improvement in fiscal 2024 with many of the drivers continuing into fiscal 2025. Now, let me turn into our NIKE, Inc. fourth quarter results. In Q4 NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 5% on a reported basis and 8% on a currency neutral basis. NIKE Direct grew 18% with 14% growth in NIKE Digital, and 24% growth in NIKE Stores. Wholesale grew 2%, moderating as planned, as we tightened supply to normalize marketplace inventory levels. Gross margins declined a 140 basis points to 43.6% on a reported basis, primarily due to higher product input costs and elevated freight and logistics expenses. Higher markdowns, and 100 basis points of unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by strategic pricing actions and lapping higher inventory obsolescence reserves in Greater China in the prior period. SG&A grew 8% on a reported basis, primarily due to wage related expenses, variable NIKE direct costs, and increased demand creation expenses. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%. Diluted earnings per share was $0.66. Now, let me turn to our operating segments. In North America, Q4 revenue grew 5%. NIKE Direct was up 15%, and NIKE Digital grew 17%. Wholesale declined 3%, following reduced spring and summer sell-in to proactively manage marketplace inventory. EBIT declined 6% on a reported basis. For another consecutive quarter, strong consumer demand drove total retail sales up double-digits across the marketplace, enabling us to drive a quicker return to healthy marketplace inventory levels. Member engagement grew on all-digital platforms and buying frequency was at an all-time high. NIKE's store traffic and revenue grew double-digits surpassing industry trends. We saw strong brand momentum across our portfolio. Performance dimensions delivered strong growth with LeBron and Giannis at double-digits. Free Metcon extended its lead as our top women's performance franchise. And the Jordan brand delivered another dominant quarter with women's leading growth. Luka and Tatum highlighting momentum and performance, and iconic franchises inspiring the next generation. In fact, this quarter's AJ 1's Spider-Verse launch drove our largest ever kids shock drop on the sneakers app. With a robust product pipeline, a healthy mix of inventory, and a normalizing supply chain, we are confident in NIKE's ability to set the pace in North America as we look ahead. In EMEA, Q4 revenue grew 7%. NIKE Direct was up 28%, and NIKE Digital grew 24%. EBIT declined 13% on a reported basis. EMEA's fourth quarter results demonstrated the strength of our complete offense as NIKE increased market share in performance and lifestyle. Digital continues to power growth with traffic up double-digits and conversion rates expanding. Brick-and-mortar traffic in key countries also remain strong. NIKE's authenticity in sport and culture continues to create separation. Vaporfly and Alphafly top shoe counts, at the Paris and London marathons, while Pegasus and Invincible drove strong sell-through. We channeled the energy of Air Max Day into positive momentum for Air Max Pulse and Air Max 1. And we closed out our biggest football year ever, up double digits with strong full price sales, led by Mercurial and Phantom, and balanced growth across men's, women's, and kids. In Greater China, Q4 revenue grew 25%. NIKE Direct grew 19% with NIKE Digital declining 12% as consumer buying continues to over index in brick-and-mortar versus the prior year. EBIT grew 70% on a reported basis. This quarter left no doubt. Sport is back. Consumer confidence is rebounding, and NIKE's brand momentum is growing. We celebrated the return of sport with full marketing activations around the Chinese high school basketball league, Air Max Day, and Super Brand Day. And we extended that energy into our strongest product sell-through in eight seasons with full price momentum accelerated by our healthy inventory position. Running grew double-digits, fueled by newness in hyperlocal storytelling, including strong express lane executions for Invisible 3 and community activations around Pegasus 40. Basketball grew double-digits, led by the GT Cut. And we saw exceptional sell-through for our GT jump players edition inspired by longtime NIKE athlete, NIKE athlete, Ijen Leon. Earlier this month, our 6/18 results surpassed last year's record breaking performance with sales up double-digits. And next week, we will build on that momentum as we kick-off NIKE's first athlete tour in China since the pandemic by welcoming Giannis to Beijing. As we look forward, we are confident in the strength of our consumer connections and confident in NIKE's ability to drive sustainable long-term growth in China. In APLA, Q4 revenue grew 6%, including approximately 6 percentage points of a headwind due to the impact of our shift to a distributor model in Central and South America. NIKE Direct was up 9% with NIKE Digital growing 9%. EBIT declined 16% on a reported basis. This quarter highlighted our balanced growth in the region. Jordan Brand continued its international expansion with strong double-digit growth as our new world of flight doors in Tokyo and Seoul create local brand energy. We also saw strong growth in women's lifestyle and men's performance with positive momentum from Cortez and Vamiro 5 and sustained strength from Pegasus and Invincible 3. In global football, we drove double-digit growth across men's, women's, and kids with excitement building ahead of this summer's women's world cup. We finished the year in APLA with new milestones and new opportunities in the region. In Southeast Asia and India, we grew our business by over 40% this year, reinforcing the potential that we see in the market. In Korea, our NIKE app launch drove 2.5 million downloads and $100 million in incremental demand within its first quarter, showing how elevated local digital experiences can accelerate consumer demand. And across the region, we continue investing to grow. From launching argentina.com and peru.com to introducing NIKE's first direct digital footprint in India. Now, let me turn to our fiscal 2024 financial outlook. We enter the new year with clear advantages, strong consumer momentum, a robust product innovation pipeline, healthy inventory, and a normalized flow of supply. That said, we are closely monitoring the macro environment, consumer behavior, and retail trends. Our priority for fiscal 2024 is to drive healthy full price growth, while unlocking speed, agility, and efficiency in our operating model. We are focused on what we can control as we position NIKE to compete at its best. We are taking a balanced approach to planning our business, building on our proactive decisions more than six months ago to [tighten buys] [ph]. We expect this to translate into an improved marginal cost of growth, expanding profitability and higher returns on invested capital. We have also taken into account several non-count factors from the prior year that will impact overall rates of growth, as well as quarterly comparisons. For the full-year, we expect fiscal 2024 reported revenue to grow mid-single-digits, led by NIKE Direct. This includes approximately four points of headwinds from the prior year from wholesale shipment timing and accelerated liquidation activities. In addition, based on current spot rates, we do not expect any material translation impact on revenue in fiscal 2024. We expect gross margins to expand a 140 basis points to a 160 basis points on a reported basis, which translates to approximately 200 basis points of operational gross margin expansion, excluding 50 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange headwinds. This reflects the beginning of recovery from transitory headwinds, including more favorable ocean freight rates starting halfway through the second quarter and a modest improvement in markdowns versus the prior year. We also expect continued structural gains from our focus on price value, including low-single-digit price increases in fiscal 2024, plus ongoing benefits from our shift to a more direct business. We expect this to be partially offset by higher product costs with inflation causing higher labor and fulfillment expenses in parts of our supply chain. We expect SG&A to grow slightly above revenue as we increase investment in demand creation to support key global sports moments and product launches and invest in capabilities to transform NIKE's operating model for greater speed and effectiveness. We will continue to manage SG&A to remain below pre-pandemic levels as a percentage of revenue. Our other income and expense, including net interest income, is expected to be 225 million to 275 million of income the year, and we expect our effective tax rate to be similar to fiscal 2023. Now, let me provide a few important insights into our first quarter. We expect first quarter revenue growth to be flat to up low-single-digits, reflecting our decision to tighten first half buys and restrain marketplace inventory. We expect another quarter of sequential improvement in gross margin, down 50 basis points to 75 basis points on a reported basis, which translates to 25 basis points to 50 basis points of operational gross margin expansion, excluding the negative impact of a 100 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. We expect SG&A to grow low double digits on a reported basis, driven by increased demand creation investments around the women's World Cup and transformational investments to drive efficiency including the activation of the next stages of our ERP implementation in North America. Looking ahead, we will remain agile and on the offense, leveraging our experience, and the capabilities that we have developed to lead through times of uncertainty, while investing to capture the growth opportunities in front of us. For NIKE, creating the future always starts with serving athletes and sport. As we look to fiscal 2024, we have an incredible year of sport ahead of us from this summer's World Cup to the road to the Paris Olympic Games, it will be a year to remember, and just like the athletes we serve, NIKE will be ready to bring our best. With that, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Tom Nikic with Wedbush Securities. Tom Nikic : Hi everybody. Thank you very much for taking my question. I want to ask about North America and specifically the wholesale channel. And I think, you know, there's been some news recently about maybe some wholesale partners that you had either exited or deemphasized and now you're going back into some of those retailers. What drove that decision? And I guess, kind of what changed in your mindset that maybe a year or two ago, you saw \u2013 the [SW] [ph] was not somebody you wanted to partner with, but now you do and Macy's, et cetera? So just any insight or color there would be really helpful. Thanks. John Donahoe : Yes, Tom, I'll take that. Let me just saw right up front, our marketplace strategy remains the same as it's been over the last several years. And this is simply a continued evolution of the very same marketplace strategy. And I'll remind you that our marketplace strategy is driven by the consumer. I mean, at the end of the day, we start with the consumer, and consumers in this day and age want to get what they want, when they want it, how they want it. Consumers want digital and physical access. They shop across both channels, they want a mono-brand and multi-brand. They use different shopping occasions to use different channels. Consumers expect us to know who they are, and consumers have said to us they want a consistent and seamless experience. And so that is what has driven our marketplace strategy. And as you know, it starts with digital or a direct connection with the consumer. Our digital apps, our mobile apps are unmatched in the industry, and that's our fastest-growing channel that will continue to be our fastest-growing channel because we directly connect with the consumer digitally. We augment that with owned retail, where we are building out stores, NIKE stores in segments that are currently underserved by our wholesale partners, we would say women's is one of those cases in Jordan being another. So, we're selectively opening new doors. And then multi-brand wholesale partners play a really important role. And as I said in my remarks, there's different segments. So, we spent a lot of focus and attention, and we've talked a lot over the last couple of years about the larger multi-brand partners like DICK's and JD and Foot Locker and Sports Direct. We've talked some around neighborhood doors where we authenticate, that's such an important role. And then we have accounts that help us serve distinct segments of consumers or price points. And so what we've done over the past quarter is simply an extension of that. Our Direct business will continue to grow the fastest, but we'll continue to expand our marketplace strategy to enable access to as many consumers as possible and drive growth. Operator : And next up is Matthew Boss, JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Great. Thanks. So John, with the expanded definition of sport and greater awareness of health and wellness that you cited, could you elaborate on how you believe the NIKE brand is positioned to capture market share globally? And then, Matt, on the revenue guide for this year, could you just help bridge 1Q relative to the full-year? Maybe some of the puts and takes, I think, would be really helpful in terms of getting from the first quarter to the full-year. John Donahoe : Thanks, Matt. And Matt Friend, I'll take the first. So Matt Boss, we see the same structural tailwinds you just described. We are blessed with structural tailwinds around an expanding definition of sport, particularly around health and wellness and a related structural tailwind around this movement toward athleisure. And our marketplace strategy is simply geared to expand, leverage our competitive advantages to not only gain share, but also grow the market by being where consumers are. And again, as I said a minute ago, to give them when they want, how they want it. Two examples come to mind. One is just digital. I cannot tell you how important it is, our mobile apps. In fact, in Q4, our four mobile apps, SNKRS, the NIKE Mobile App, NTC and NRC had over 500 million visitors within the quarter, and that's just in the U.S. or North America, APLA, and EMEA, doesn\u2019t even count in China. So, there's no one else in the industry that has anything close to that. And what that means is, we are in \u2013 we're in the privileged position of being in consumers' pockets and on their home screens of their phones. That's cherish real estate. So, our mobile apps give us a huge advantage because it creates shopping occasions when they're browsing on SNKRS. It creates shopping occasions when they're working out. It connects us to consumers globally and will help us both grow the market and gain share. A second example will be around health and wellness in women's, and we talked in my remarks about the NIKE Well Collective. And what this really is, is, [Amy Montagne] [ph] is leading our women's team and just doing a fabulous job. Amy and her team have sharp consumer insight around through the eyes of the women consumer, the female consumer, this intersection of sport, wellness, community and it's all infused with style. The distinction of style and performance for women is a much more nuanced and integrated thing. And so, NIKE Well Collective is both a branding and a way that our voice to her and our storytelling to her will come to life, but also our retail doors. And we have been opening Nike Live Doors, as you know. We'll rebrand those NIKE Well Collective.  I will tell you the NIKE Live doors, which are largely focused on women consumers, are performing very strongly around women's performance product, around women's fitness, leggings and bras, around lifestyle as well. And so in that way, we're expanding our access to women consumers. And so, we'll continue in our marketplace strategy. It really reiterates what I said a minute ago of being aggressive to be where the consumer is, so that we're there when they want us, where they want us and how they want us. Matt Friend : And Matt, I'll just jump in on the question around revenue guidance. Let me start by just saying we're incredibly pleased by the growth that we delivered in fiscal year 2023 with 16% growth on a currency-neutral basis. And if you look at our results in North America and EMEA on a currency-neutral basis, our growth was even higher. When you then compare our reported revenue growth to retail sales growth to the consumer across the marketplace, we drove strong double-digit growth in retail sales to the consumer throughout the year, including that trend continuing into the fourth quarter. And NIKE Direct in the fourth quarter grew 18% versus the prior year. So, in this fourth quarter, remember that we moderated the sell into wholesale, but continued in terms of trying to prioritize a healthy marketplace, and we still drove strong growth in retail sales across the marketplace. As we look ahead to fiscal 2024 and the mid-single-digit guide, it starts with the approach that we've been taking around assessing marketplace health and our consumer trends and then the pressure that we see \u2013 the potential pressure that we see on the consumer. And so, we made a decision to tighten our first half buys and continue the trend that we had done in the second half, but we are expecting retail sales to continue a trend, so retail sales to the consumer to continue a trend of growth versus the prior year. And actually, when we look at the first half and the second half of next year, we're actually planning for a fairly consistent level of retail sales growth to the consumer. The distinction with the first half is that we're continuing to manage marketplace inventory and continue to just manage marketplace health. NIKE Direct is going to continue to lead our growth. And when we look at next year in the second half, in particular, we're excited about the new products that we brought to market this year and scaling them next year. We're excited about new product introductions and then ultimately capturing the energy around the Paris Olympics, which is a wonderful moment for NIKE. But mid-single-digit revenue growth on the full-year, and that includes four points of non-comp headwinds from wholesale shipment timing in fiscal year 2023, plus some of the accelerated liquidation activities that we have. So, all told in this environment, we feel like mid-single digits is a great number. Operator : And Jim Duffy from Stifel is up next. Jim Duffy : Thank you for taking my questions. Some great progress on the inventories, and you spoke to an improved inventory posture in the marketplace. Just thinking about competitive dynamics, can you elaborate on your expectations for the promotional backdrop in fiscal 2024? And then related to that, you were very promotional clearing inventory across fiscal 2023, how does that factor into your outlook for the mid-single-digit growth and specifically the growth for the DTC business? Thank you. John Donahoe : Sure. Well, Jim, I would say, in general, the marketplace remains highly promotional. And when we step back and look at the actions that we took last year, we're very happy with where we finished the year. In fact, our inventory levels are ahead of our plan and ahead of the competition. We saw total marketplace inventory units down versus the prior year. And when we look at NIKE-owned inventory in particular, we feel incredibly good about where we are and the plans that we have going into the first half of next year. The large majority of our strategic partners have also done a beautiful job moving through the inventory and balancing the trade-offs of investing in consumer connections, elevating the retail environment, and moving through inventory. And so, we feel great about where we are, but we recognize that next year, the environment is going to continue to be promotional and that even puts pressure on our wholesale partners in terms of how they think about managing through the first half of the year. And so, we believe that the right focus and attention for NIKE is to focus on recovering a higher level of full price growth in fiscal year 2024, profitable growth, full price growth. The mid-single-digit guide does reflect four points, as I mentioned, of non-comp impacts, which are partially wholesale shipment timing because you recall last year, there was a lot of late supply from 2022 that came into 2023, but also a little bit of extra liquidation as we were more aggressive in moving inventory both through our own channels and our partner channels. But when I look at our growth plan for next year, adjusting for the comp headwind and look at the profitability recovery that we see on the margin \u2013 gross margin and EBIT line, I feel like it's a great plan and sets us up well for long-term growth and profitability. Operator : Your next question is Kate McShane, Goldman Sachs. Brooke Roach : Good afternoon. This is Brooke Roach filling in for Kate. Thank you so much for taking our question. You commented in the prepared remarks about seeing around the corner on transitory cost headwinds that have pressured your profitability and FY 2024, we'll start to see some relief there. Can you speak to the proportion of transitory costs that you anticipate to recapture in FY 2024? And what's still on the horizon for FY 2025 and beyond? Thank you. Matt Friend : Sure. So, when we look at where we ended the year and the progress that we've made on inventory, we feel really good about our ability to drive healthy growth in 2024. And so \u2013 and you see that in our gross margin guide. We're guiding to expand margins by 140 basis points to 160 basis points, and that includes a 50 basis point negative FX headwind. If we back out the FX, it's approximately 200 basis points of operational gross margin expansion. The large majority of the 200 basis points is the beginning recapture of transitory headwinds. We will continue to see structural benefits in fiscal year 2024, but those are being partially offset by higher product costs and inflation in parts of our supply chain. When I look at the large majority of our transitory headwinds, we've been talking about two for the past several years. One is, freight and logistics; and the second one is, liquidation. We've now negotiated our ocean freight rates with partners for fiscal year 2024, and we've negotiated rates that are near pre-pandemic levels. Those benefits don't kick-in until halfway through the second quarter. And so, we'll start to see that tailwind come in, in Q2 and then accelerate in Q3 and Q4 and then carry into fiscal year 2025. As it relates to the liquidation impact, we are planning for an improvement in full price mix and markdowns. And we've baked that into our plans for fiscal year 2024, but we recognize, as I answered the question for Jim a little bit earlier, that we continue to operate in a promotional marketplace. And so, we're going to continue to read and react. And as a result of that, we've planned for a modest recovery of those costs. And you'll also recall that in fiscal year 2023, we were comparing to extraordinary levels of full price realization, well above the 65% threshold that we had provided as our target. And so, at this point in time, we're not planning that we're going to recover back to that level of full price realization, but that instead, we will be operating at or around the 65% level, but we've also now seen a new way of living. And so, it gives us some optimism that there can be more opportunity than even the metric that we've provided. But those two things taking into consideration, as we look to our margins beyond 2024, there's going to be some structural tailwind that comes from freight and that \u2013 or sorry, some benefit that's going to come from freight. And then our focus is going to be on the structural drivers that give us confidence in achieving the long-term margins that we've been talking about. Operator : Cristina Fernandez, Telsey Advisory Group has the next question. Cristina Fernandez : Hi, good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to see if you could talk about the recovery you're seeing in China? How big that progressed through the quarter? And just overall, when you look at the marketplace, how is it different today versus pre-pandemic and your ability to use your athletes and influencers to drive sales? John Donahoe : Yes. Cristina, probably the highlight of the last 90 days for me was getting back to China for the first time post-pandemic. And I will tell you, it just \u2013 it was such a palpable reminder, a, what a strong team we have there. And I just want to again call out our China team who has just done a spectacular job over challenge after challenge after challenge over the last three or four years. But what's also clear is the consumers back in China and NIKE and Jordan brand are strong. So, you heard our Q4 growth was 25%. We had a strong 6/18, and that's across different categories, performance and lifestyle men's, women's, kids, really strong performance in running and basketball wholesale fitness. But what was really clear is that the NIKE formula of the best innovation combined with great local storytelling, combined with the marketplace is connecting with Chinese consumers, particularly Gen Z. And so, the Gen Z consumer in China cares about innovation, and they're doing a great job of taking our global innovations and hyper-localizing them as well a great job of local storytelling. When I was there, we saw \u2013 Craig Williams and I were there together, we saw that live streaming studio where we do a lot of live streaming in a way that really connects with Gen Z. Social shopping is taking off in China in a bigger way than other places, and we're at the front edge of that. And then as you know, we have 6,000 mono-brand doors that provide such an advantage. I will tell you being in several of those doors in Shanghai and Beijing, what was \u2013 it was right when the Motiva was launched. And the far majority of those 6,000 doors, the first floor is dedicated to women's. And you walk in, it is some of the best merchandising of a great innovation like Motiva connected to her, pulling her off the street and into the doors. And so, we'll continue to invest in China. Our China for China strategy, I think, is going very, very well. And looking ahead, we're optimistic about NIKE's Brand, Jordan's Brand, the momentum we have as well, we think it's a structural tailwinds in the region make us optimistic over the long-term. Gen Z is the most active generation. There's a growing middle class, increased focus on health and wellness. So, a very energizing visit and makes us very confident about our brands and our business in China. Matt Friend : I think that the other thing I would just add is, the activity and the effort that we've taken over the last three quarters to improve our inventory position in the marketplace. We had another great quarter we reported. And where you really see that come to life in a mono-brand marketplace, where you can see the full breadth in our stores is that you get the full breadth of a seasonal assortment, which is when NIKE is operating at its best. Leading with innovation, China actually is our largest penetration of innovation of any geography that we operate in, and that connects well with what John referenced in terms of what the consumer is looking for. But this quarter, in particular, as we've improved our inventory position, we saw the highest level of full price selling that we've seen in eight quarters. And that just shows the strength of NIKE when we have a healthy marketplace and we can bring the breadth of the assortment and the depth of our stories to bear for the consumer and to drive consumer demand. Operator : And our final question today will come from John Kernan TD Cowen. John Kernan : Excellent. Thanks for taking my question. Matt, just wanted to go back to the margin puts and takes and maybe talk a little bit about the long-term margin targets that were issued way back in fiscal 2022. I know a lot has changed since then, but are we still thinking in terms of a high-teens operating margin long-term? And how do we think about the margin profile of DTC and the mix shift of the DTC? Matt Friend : Sure, John. Well, let me start \u2013 I'll start with the back and I'll come to the front in terms of the way you asked the question. We're making substantial progress towards the long-term goals that we had highlighted a couple of years ago. Our Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy has been a consumer-led strategy. And when we look at the mix of our business in Digital and in Direct relative to where we were in fiscal year 2019, we've made significant progress against it. And we continue to invest to grow based on the fact that consumer continues to choose to shop in our stores and in our digital channels or at least to engage in our digital channels before they go try to find the product that they want in the wholesale marketplace. And so, we're very pleased with where we are today. We finished fiscal year 2023 at a 44% mix in total Direct and a 26% mix in Digital. And the consumer will decide the ultimate endpoint. And what I mean by that is, whether we land exactly at 60% or not, it doesn't really matter. But what we are confident long-term is that we're going to be a more Direct and a more profitable company. And so, when I look at our guidance for fiscal year 2024 and the gross margin expansion that we're planning for on an operational basis, we're making significant progress to come back to where we were prior to the transitory impacts. And then we still see the benefits of structural opportunities to drive our margin long-term. We've talked about those before. Those include the price value that we create in our products and the opportunity that creates for us to raise prices to the impact of having an increasing channel mix to some of the cost \u2013 product cost opportunities we see through simplification of our SKU line and end-to-end efficiency. But the time line to predict when we're going to get there, as we've been talking about for a couple of quarters is, is difficult to predict. And a point on that in cases, we've got 150 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds between last year and this year. But we are confident that we're on the path towards achieving these long-term goals, even though it's a little bit more difficult to predict the exact time that we're going to get there, but we think that we're on a path to the high-40s long-term gross margin goal. And at this point, we're continuing to do within our control in order to move us in that direction. John Donahoe : And Matt, John, I'll just build on one of the things that Matt says, the key to the whole thing is having the best innovation in the industry. That's what brings people to our Direct channels that brings people to our Digital channels. And the momentum Heidi has had her team together offsite earlier this week and seeing the design, product creation, men's, women's, kids, storytelling and brand teams, really accelerating the pace of innovation, accelerating our ability to connect with the consumer is ultimately what's going to fuel not only our top line, but also our bottom line. And so, the feeling of momentum and confidence is really growing as we move into this more streamlined structure. Operator : And everyone, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. It also concludes our conference for today. We would like to thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

For those who want to reference today's press release, you'll find it at investors.nike.com. Leading today's call is Paul Trussell, VP of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Trussell. Please go ahead. Paul Trussell : Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal 2024 first quarter results. Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe; and our CFO, Matt Friend. Before we begin, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in NIKE's reports filed with the SEC. In addition, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures and nonpublic financial and statistical information. Please refer to NIKE's earnings press release or NIKE's website, investors.nike.com, for comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations. All growth comparisons on the call today are presented on a year-over-year basis and are currency neutral unless otherwise noted. We will start with prepared remarks and then open up for questions. We would like to allow as many of you to participate as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial question to one. Thanks for your cooperation. I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe. John Donahoe : Thank you, Paul, and hello to everyone on today's call. NIKE's foundational competitive advantages are the envy of the industry. As the global athletic market leader, our scale and portfolio allow us to create an impact that only NIKE can. Consumers all over the world recognize NIKE as the number 1 champion for athletes and sport as we fuel inspiration and push the limit of human potential with the industry's most innovative products. Over the past few years, we've navigated through an unprecedented external environment. We've worked through many challenges, societal, geopolitical, global health, supply chain and more. And during this time, NIKE has grown larger and stronger. In fiscal '19, NIKE's revenues were $39 billion. Today, we're over $50 billion. And what's more, our growth has outpaced the overall industry during this period. Let me offer a few examples of how we've redefined the game over the past two years. The consumer told us they wanted lifestyle product, and we delivered, growing Air Force 1, AJ1 and Dunk to be the three largest footwear franchises in industry history. We continue to set the bar in key global sports like basketball and global football. Jordan is now one of the leading brands in North America with potential for so much more. We've accelerated digital capabilities that fuel engagement with our brands and deepen direct consumer connections around the world. The list could go on and on. But we have a saying here at NIKE. There is no finish line. We never settle. We always measure ourselves against our full potential. NIKE has always been synonymous with sport. We're at our best when we deliver breakthrough ideas by lining up innovative product with distinctive storytelling delivered through differentiated marketplace experiences. And when we do it well, we expand and grow the market. Today, as I've just mentioned, we're succeeding in many areas of our business, but we expect more of ourselves and others. For example, over the past few years, we launched new product innovations in running, but we need to drive more meaningful consumer connections among everyday runners and scale these innovations more effectively across the marketplace. Our storytelling has driven energy in many areas, but we have opportunity to cut through with more sharpness and clarity around the performance benefits and distinction of our products. And we built a best-in-class marketplace with unrivaled scale and reach. But we have opportunity to deliver more compelling assortments, particularly when it comes to serving our women consumers. So across our company, we are focused and mobilized to address areas where we need to raise our game while continuing to drive competitive separation across the board. We're aligned. We're confident, and we kick in to a new gear. One recent example, a couple of weeks ago, we had over 300 leaders from across the globe gathered here in Beaverton to immerse ourselves in our fall '24 lineup. Now our teams have been back together in person over the past 15 months, and our innovation pipeline is strong, and it was on full display. The excitement and alignment of our leadership team was clear as we continue to obsess the product and storytelling we'll be bringing to life for consumers at the Paris Olympics and into the fall. Simply put, our teams are on the offense as we compete to win in all segments. And so today, I'd like to offer three examples where NIKE showed our best this quarter, where we brought together product, storytelling and marketplace to connect with consumers and drive results. Let's start with this summer's World Cup. At NIKE, as I've said before, it always starts with great product. And in football, that's led by Phantom Luna and Mercurial, our most innovative football boots as well as our array of national team kits designed for elite female players and last but not least, our style-driven collections that stood out so well this summer. We brought our culture of innovation to life through our storytelling as we dominated the conversation with a leading share of social voice. In particular, we were incredibly effective in reaching Gen Z women through our lens of sports, style and culture. On TikTok, our priority channel for Gen Z, our engaged audience, meaning those who actively interacted with our content, was up 172%, a huge statement of NIKE's ability to connect with authenticity to this important demographic. And we also extended the tournament's energy through our stores. I was in Australia this summer and got to experience our Dream Arena, the immersive retail destination we created for the World Cup by transforming our Sydney flagship store, just the latest example of how we can amplify global sport moments at retail. The experiences inside Dream Arena included the best of NIKE, Jersey customization, local co-creator workshops, NIKE trainer-led workouts, exclusive product launches and more. The response to Dream Arena surpassed our expectations with some great learnings we plan to use at scale moving forward. And all this led to results. In both footwear and apparel, we beat our sell-through plans with strong double-digit growth across men's, women's and kids in Global Football. In EMEA, all our key boot franchises, Mercurial, Phantom, Tiempo and Phantom Luna saw double-digit growth in Q1, leading adult Global Football to grow double digits in the geo. And in APLA, football also grew double digits with strong growth in kid-sized kits as we continue to inspire the next generation of fans to fall in love with the sport. And whether it was from this summer's World Cup and the Euros last summer or the WNBA and our investment in coaching, we are committed to growing the game for women's sports. Next, let's touch on basketball, another area where you can see our end-to-end offense driving accelerated competitive advantage. In basketball, we have an unprecedented portfolio of product. Earlier this month, we announced our latest signature shoe, Devin Booker's Nike Book 1. It's a shoe built for comfort and performance with clean on and off court style. The Nike Book 1 will hit retail in December with consumer energy already building. And the Sabrina 1 continued its very strong sell-through this quarter, with both women's and men's interests high. And just a few hours ago, we launched the LeBron XXI. The XXI built on the success of the XX by keeping its low profile design and adding premium lightweight materials designed to connect with younger generations. And Q1 also saw the official introduction of the Kobe Brand. We commemorated Kobe Day on August 24, with rereleases to very strong demand. In fact, demand's so strong that we only fulfilled a fraction of it. And along with Vanessa Bryant, we also selected six schools to be honored as Mamba programs for the upcoming college basketball season, with both their men's and women's teams having the opportunity to wear Kobe Brand player exclusive footwear. We see huge potential with the Kobe Brand both on and off the court as we continue to honor his legacy. And this quarter, we also brought the energy of basketball directly to the consumer. We hosted tournaments in cities like L.A. and Chicago, culminating with the Nike World Basketball Festival in New York. These events created an electric atmosphere, especially during the NBA off-season like only NIKE can. And in a quarter where Jordan footwear grew double digits, the Jordan Brand demonstrated its power by bringing Zion, Luka and Jayson Tatum to Paris for Quai 54, which is one of the world's biggest streetwear and street ball tournaments that doubled as a showcase of the culture and growing community of basketball. Now moments like these don't just grow competitive separation for NIKE and Jordan. They also are how we grow the game and we grow the broader market. Finally, I'll walk through the geography where our overall vision comes to life best, Greater China. In Q1, Greater China grew double digits for the second straight quarter, and we're taking share in the market. It's in Greater China that we offer the consumer NIKE's most premium and elevated retail. The team gets the most out of our innovative product through world-class and locally relevant storytelling and strong marketplace execution. A great example is our women's business, which outpaced overall growth in the quarter. The work the team has done to serve our women's consumer in Greater China is proof of what NIKE can do when all the pieces are aligned. A highlight in Q1 in Greater China was our 3-day sport festival, Sportchella, where we welcomed thousands of women to connect with our three brands through movement and mindfulness. The team amplified the impact of the festival by partnering with Tmall to create the first Nike Super Brand Week, which drove more than 2 billion impressions. And this partnership seamlessly integrated the events with a digital shopping journey that generated very strong consumer response and engagement. Our Greater China team also brings our brands to life through our best retail experiences fueled by strong and meaningful storytelling. These breakthrough retail experiences highlight our innovations and marketing in a clear package for the consumer. For example, in Q1, our seasonal presentations and curated head-to-toe style guides had very favorable consumer response. And once again, this combination of innovation, storytelling and marketplace execution led to results. We took share in women's in Greater China this quarter, with strong growth across a wide range of products, from footwear with the Motiva and Free Metcon to apparel with our statement bras and leggings. All in all, across our entire portfolio, the Greater China team has orchestrated a fully connected marketplace. They continue to transform digital commerce, launching China-specific versions of our apps, which are faster for consumers and more personalized, including a new Jordan destination to the Nike App in Q1; and their expanding connected partnership, which after just a few quarters is now live in 350 doors across 102 cities and is driving substantially higher member demand versus last quarter. Simply put, Greater China sets the execution standard for us, and our goal is to scale their success across all of our geographies, every sport and every dimension of our business. And that's how we win over the long term. In the end, as I've said, we're focused in moving with great confidence against the opportunities we see. Our teams feel energized, united by our shared passion and urgency for competing at the highest level. We set high expectations for ourselves at Nike. That's what winners do. And now more than ever, we're ready to bring our very best and demonstrate what NIKE is capable of. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Matt Friend : Thanks, John, and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE's first quarter results demonstrated the impact of staying on the offense when we drove a quicker return to a healthy marketplace in fiscal '23 and leading with operational discipline as we begin the new fiscal year. We delivered Q1 results in line with our guidance. Retail sales across NIKE Direct and Wholesale continue to grow on top of extraordinary sales this past year. Both Nike inventory and our total marketplace inventory are healthy. Working capital efficiency is improving with a normalized supply chain. Gross margins are expanding on an operational basis, excluding the effects of foreign exchange and transitory headwinds are abating. In short, we are building on a strong foundation for sustainable and more profitable long-term growth. Before reviewing our financial results, let me first speak to what we are seeing from our consumer in the marketplace and where we are driving focus and attention to unlock even greater potential ahead. In Q1, retail sales across NIKE Direct and Wholesale grew mid-single digits versus the prior year. Our top franchises are driving strong full price sales and our newest product offerings across Nike, Jordan and Converse are generating positive consumer reception. Looking at inventory. We continue to feel very good about our position. NIKE inventory dollars are down 10% versus the prior year. Our total inventory units across the marketplace, including NIKE and our wholesale partners, are down double digits versus the prior year. Partner-owned inventory units are in line with the previous year, with levels planned to remain lean through our second quarter, a meaningful accomplishment after higher levels of wholesale sell-in during fiscal '23. On the whole, we are very comfortable with the level of inventory in the marketplace in relation to the retail sales that we're seeing as we begin increasing levels of wholesale sell-in in our second half. And overall, we're confident in the health and shape of our marketplace. NIKE Direct continues to lead our growth, up 6% versus the prior year. As we deliver on our strategy to elevate the marketplace through premium physical and digital retail experiences, we continue to see that consumers want to connect directly and personally with our brands. And in fact, member engagement within our direct business is up double digits versus the prior year, with increasing average order values. Our stores delivered in an especially strong quarter, with traffic up double digits from last year and members driving an increasing share of our business as consumers shifted from our digital to physical channels. This is similar to what we are seeing across the industry. And after seeing this trend build in early July or in early June, our team was nimble in transitioning inventory to capture higher full price sales across our entire store fleet. NIKE Digital grew 2% with nonlinear comparisons to the prior year, including liquidation actions and a higher number of product launches on the SNKRS app in fiscal '23. Looking through all that. What stands out are the underlying consumer trends we see in our digital business. This includes sustained momentum on the NIKE mobile app with growth in traffic and increasing member buying frequency. We continue to see a growing structural advantage as more consumers start their shopping journeys with us on mobile. Meanwhile, within wholesale, we see largely positive results from our most important strategic partners. Specifically, we were pleased to see high single-digit to low double-digit retail sales growth and strong inventory management with many of our key partners, including DICK's Sporting Goods and city specialty partners in North America, JD, Zalando and Sports Direct in EMEA and Topsports and Pou Sheng in Greater China. We continue the reset of our business with Foot Locker, planning for near-term sales declines as they invest in consumer-right concepts for the future. Ultimately, we have a segmented portfolio of strong partners across price points and channels with no single partner representing more than a mid-single digit of NIKE's total business. And looking across the entire marketplace, we are confident in our brand momentum as we accelerate direct consumer connections, elevate our brands and create capacity for long-term growth. Looking ahead, our priorities start with our product pipeline. And over the coming seasons, we will build on the market share gains that we have accelerated in recent years, by scaling newness and innovation across our portfolio, while carefully managing the health of our most iconic product franchises. This year, for example, we will build on the consumer momentum around running and modern comfort with performance and lifestyle franchises such as Infinity, Motiva, Invincible, Vomero 5, V2K and the Air Max 1. We will refresh our basketball portfolio across Nike and Jordan through innovation and style and grow the Kobe brand. We will ignite the next chapters of Pegasus, the Jordan Game shoe and Tech Fleece while continuing to grow powerhouses like Dunk and Metcon. And as we look towards the second half of this fiscal year and beyond from the tenth anniversary of Air Max Day to the Paris Olympic Games, we will introduce our next wave of Nike Air innovation. This will bring our most comprehensive evolution of the Air platform in years, one that we expect to catalyze both our brand and business. We will deliver pinnacle performance innovation to athletes while also scaling into new lifestyle franchises over the next several years. Ultimately, we are focused on scaling a deep, diverse and distinct product portfolio, not just for one quarter or one season, but for years to come. Last, we are turning the corner in driving more profitable growth while also recovering on transitory cost headwinds. This includes structural improvements in profitability in areas such as supply chain, with reduced digital switch shipments and improved digital fulfillment costs enabled by investments in our regional service centers, and a new transportation management system. In addition, NIKE Brand ASPs are up across footwear and apparel across all geographies as we focus on the price value of our products. And in Greater China, consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, healthy inventory and sequential improvement in full price sales will enable us to begin rebuilding towards higher profitability in the geography. Finally, we are focused on improving our marginal cost of growth with more modest increases in operating overhead this fiscal year, following two consecutive years of double-digit growth. We are doing this by unlocking speed and productivity as we transform our operating model to build a faster and more efficient Nike. Now let me turn to our NIKE, Inc. first quarter results. In Q1, NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 2% on a reported and currency-neutral basis. NIKE Direct grew 6%, with NIKE stores growing 12% and NIKE Digital up 2%. Wholesale grew 1%, reflecting our proactive decisions to restrain inventory supply and prioritize marketplace health, particularly in North America. Gross margin declined 10 basis points to 44.2% on a reported basis, primarily driven by higher product costs, and approximately 90 basis points of unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, almost completely offset by strategic pricing actions. SG&A grew 5% on a reported basis, primarily due to increased demand creation expenses around World Cup and more moderate increases in operating overhead benefiting from shifts in timing of technology investments for the remainder of the year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 12% compared to 19.7% for the same period last year. primarily due to a onetime benefit provided by the recent delay of the effective date of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations. Diluted earnings per share was $0.94. Now let me turn to our operating segments. In North America, Q1 revenue declined 1%, with wholesale down 8%, in line with our expectations following our restrained sell-in of marketplace supply. NIKE Direct was up 7% as NIKE stores grew 11% and NIKE Digital grew 4%. EBIT grew 4% on a reported basis, primarily due to strong gross margin expansion. In a competitive environment, our retail sales momentum grew throughout the quarter across NIKE Direct and wholesale. NIKE's back-to-school performance outpaced the broader industry with strong sales from our top franchises and clear consumer excitement around newness. Infinity 4 drove strong full price sales as we partnered with key running specialty accounts to host community activations. Our newest generation of Tech Fleece amplified by strong investment from key marketplace partners drove retail sales up double digits from last year across NIKE Direct and wholesale. Zenvy, Go and Universa fueled double-digit growth in statement leggings with Dunk and Free Metcon driving strong sell-through. And the Jordan brand continued its momentum with double-digit growth, led by Jordan Women's and kids as well as performance basketball. In EMEA, Q1 revenue grew 6%, with NIKE Direct also up 6%. NIKE stores grew 17% and NIKE Digital declined 2%. EBIT declined 5% on a reported basis. Global Football and fitness grew double digits and women's outpaced our total growth in the geography this quarter. New innovation and styles are resonating with Phantom Luna driving strong sell-through, Metcon up double digits and Motiva, our new walking shoe, off to a great start in creating a new performance category for NIKE. Pegasus, Invincible and Vomero also delivered strong results in the quarter. In addition, statement leggings in shorts grew double digits with integrated brand and retail experiences. And as we deepen our focus on serving all segments of the running community, trail running footwear grew double digits with new product innovation and brand activations. In Greater China, Q1 revenue grew 12%. NIKE Direct grew 10%, with NIKE stores up 12% and NIKE Digital up 6%. EBIT declined 3% on a reported basis. Throughout the quarter, we saw incredible energy around the return of sport, with thousands of young runners joining in our back-to-school kids race, players across cities taking part in our Jordan Flight basketball tournament and historical highs in social engagement with our neighborhood accounts as consumers joined in hyper local community experiences to celebrate our newest Kobe release. Retail sales across NIKE Direct and Wholesale grew double digits with another quarter of strong sell-through. In a highly promotional marketplace, we outperformed industry trends with improvement in full price sales. Our performance dimensions led growth with consumer excitement around G.T. Jump, Sabrina 1 and Invincible. And in lifestyle, Vomero and other retro running styles are gaining momentum as we prepare to scale over the coming seasons. In APLA, Q1 revenue grew 3%. NIKE Direct was up 3% with NIKE stores up 10% and NIKE Digital declining 3%. EBIT declined 17% on a reported basis. Japan, Southeast Asia, India and Mexico led our growth this quarter as we accelerate our momentum in international markets. In particular, store traffic in Japan is returning to pre-COVID levels. Sales through our new Myntra partnership in India are already exceeding plan, and Mexico's digital business delivered double-digit growth. Kids led our growth in the geography, up double digits with strong growth from Mercurial, Court Borough and Fleece. We also saw market share gains in women's lifestyle with positive consumer response to Air Max Koko, V2K and Gamma Force. In addition, Jordan continues its global growth with Luca and Tatum fueling strong momentum in Performance Basketball, and our new streetwear footwear franchise is resonating with consumers. Now let me turn to our financial outlook. As we look forward, we are confident in NIKE's new product innovation pipeline, brand strength, deep consumer connections and the health and shape of our marketplace. Our Q1 results reaffirm our expectation for healthy profitable growth this fiscal year. For the full year, we continue to expect reported revenue to grow mid-single digits. At the same time, we are closely monitoring the operating environment, including foreign currency exchange rates, consumer demand over the holiday season and our second half wholesale order book. As a reminder, this growth outlook includes approximately 4 points of headwinds from accelerated liquidation and higher wholesale sell-in during the prior year as we sold roughly five seasons of supply within four financial quarters. Therefore, quarterly comparisons across marketplace channels and in the aggregate, will be nonlinear. We continue to expect gross margins to expand 140 to 160 basis points on a reported basis, which includes 50 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange headwinds. We are cautiously planning for modest markdown improvements for the balance of the year given the promotional environment. We continue to expect SG&A to slightly outpace revenue growth. more specifically at the high end of mid-single digits. We continue to expect other income and expense, including net interest income to be $225 million to $275 million for the year and we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be in the high teens range. Now let me provide some additional color on our second quarter. We expect second quarter reported revenue growth to be up slightly versus the prior year, as we faced our most challenging comparisons from fiscal '23. We expect second quarter gross margins to expand approximately 100 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting benefits from strategic pricing, improved markdowns and lower ocean freight rates partially offset by higher product input costs. We continue to expect a negative impact from 50 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. We expect second quarter SG&A to grow mid- to high single digits. We expect our second quarter effective tax rate to be in the high teens range. For NIKE, being on the offense means competing to win now and over the long term. We are confident in our strategy, our leadership position and our ability to create even greater opportunity ahead. With that, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Bob Drbul, Guggenheim Partners. Robert Drbul : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess the first question really is, when you talk about the innovation pipeline for fall of '24. Can you just expand a little bit more in terms of the focus or the categories or really sort of what you see driving the business that you laid out at the most recent meeting? And I have a follow-up. John Donahoe : Great, Bob. Well, as I said in my remarks, we cannot underestimate the - understate, really, that the impact of having our teams back together in person over the past 15 months, and we absolutely see that kicking into gear with our product pipeline. And so this past quarter, you heard a couple of great examples of performance innovation around Phantom Luna, our World Cup kits, the Infinity 4, which had one of our latest foam platforms, React X foam, highest energy return and lowest carbon footprint, that will sustain for many quarters and years And over the next six to nine months into the Paris Olympics and default, there are several areas we're very excited about. Matt and I both talked about basketball, I don't think we've ever had a stronger portfolio of basketball shoes, whether it's the Sabrina 1, the LeBron 21, Book 1. Jordan has Tatum, Luka, Zion and a great Game Shoe coming. And then, of course, we have Kobe. So we see real growth, growing our basketball business and growing the game and market of basketball on and off the court. In running, we feel good about the Invincible 3 and Infinity 4, Vomero 5, OPeg 41, we feel very good about coming into Paris as well as the Motiva, which we think have real legs. And then Air. Air is an are putting a huge amount of focus, and we're very excited about the innovations coming in Air, both performance and lifestyle. And so we have the tenth anniversary of Air Max Day in the spring as we move into the Paris Olympics. Air will be an important opportunity both in performance and in lifestyle. So we see several opportunities to build real scalable innovation and growth. Robert Drbul : Got it. Thanks,. And I just have a question. In North America, I guess, in the current quarter, what's the bigger tailwind to the business right now? Is it the Travis Kelce jerseys or the Colorado football merchandise? John Donahoe : Oregon Ducks jersey. Matt Friend : We love the NFL and we continue to see a lot of momentum with Coach Prime, so both. Robert Drbul : Thank you. Operator : Up next is Adrienne Yih, Barclays. Adrienne Yih : Great. Thank you very much. I guess my question is going to be on kind of the shaping of wholesale. Matt, if you can help us out with the - I guess, do we expect direct to be similar to the current quarter and then the balance of that, the kind of up slightly for the current quarter guidance to the balance of that come out of North America wholesale? And then my other question is on the China market. John, you talked about kind of strength and regaining market share. But at the same time, you talked a little bit about continuing to be promotional. It's great to see that you're regaining full price. How much demand creation are you doing there? What does the promotional environment look like exiting the quarter? And any comment on exit trends? How should we think about kind of the trends over the next couple of quarters relative to your long-term algorithm? Thank you very much. Matt Friend : All right. Well, John, why don't I start on marketplace. So Adrienne, when we look at our performance this quarter, I'd be remiss to not just reiterate what I said on the call, which is we saw very strong retail sales in the marketplace up mid-single digits. And in particular, we're very pleased with the performance across a range of our most important wholesale partners, delivering growth high single digit to low double digit. What I said last quarter in terms of the way that I was thinking about channel growth for this year, I said that NIKE Direct would lead our growth. And it did this quarter, and we do expect NIKE Direct to continue to lead our growth throughout the remainder of this fiscal year. The period that we're heading into in Q2 and Q3 is really the higher levels of sell-in that we did last year as we proactively focused on returning our marketplace to a more healthy level. As an example, you might recall our Q2 wholesale revenue last year was up 30% versus the prior year. And so as we face those comparisons, we do expect that NIKE Direct will be the best indication of the growth that we're driving in the marketplace, while we comp those nonlinear comparisons in the prior year. But we feel very good about the health and the shape of our overall marketplace, including in North America. And we're continuing to focus on driving growth across dimensions, across channels, up and down price points and are very focused on building a product pipeline to enable us to do that over the coming years. John Donahoe : And Adrienne, in China, it's interesting. I've been to China twice now in the past four months. And I think, Matt, you were there in August. And I - we feel good about the market there and our position. Frankly, a couple of things stand out. One sport is back in China. You can just feel it. And that gives us great confidence about the future and the Chinese consumer in our segment regardless of the macroeconomic outlook there. And you saw we had double-digit - strong double-digit growth in Q1 and Q2, and we're helping to really drive momentum in Sport there. I talked about Sportchella. I think Matt mentioned the back-to-school kids race. Giannis, it is a tour there this summer that got a huge response outdoor basketball. So we're doing what we do best, which is driving energy and excitement around sport, which then translates into our brand connection and our consumer connection being as strong as it's been in a long time. And as I said, it's perhaps the best example currently where we bring this great innovation with distinctive storytelling with distinctive marketplace reaction. And so even in a promotional period, our full price sell-through and our innovations are connecting well and doing well. And so we got inventory in shape much sooner than the market in China. And so we're playing on the offense. We're playing on our front foot. And we feel good about the opportunities in China in the coming quarters and into the medium to long term. Matt Friend : Yes. And I would just say that I think that the retail sales growth that we referenced in our two biggest wholesale partners is a great indication of the health of our inventory and our ability, especially in this first quarter to flow a complete assortment and season into our retail stores in the marketplace. And that's NIKE at best. Our most premium elevated retail experiences, high levels of seasonal assortments where we can tell stories and really bring the breadth and the dimension to consumers. And we saw that momentum building throughout the quarter. So we feel really good about the decision we made to move fast. And even though the marketplace is promotional, we're on our front feet in terms of the way we're able to present our brand and our stories and our products to consumers in that market right now. Operator : Next, we'll take a question from Alex Straton, Morgan Stanley. Alex Straton : Perfect. Thanks so much. I just wanted to focus on kind of the running innovation that you guys highlighted a number of times on the call across areas. I think you had said you launched some running in the last few years, but perhaps it didn't connect as much as you wanted or you wanted to scale it more effectively. So could you just touch on maybe what changed in NIKE's approach in the last few years? And then what you plan to do differently to kind of reignite that? Thanks a lot. John Donahoe : Yes, Alex. As I said, we - we're at best when we align innovative product with distinctive storytelling through a differentiator marketplace. And in running, we have three different categories and running. In racing, we take our performance innovation, which sets the bar in the industry with the Alphafly, the Vaporfly and NEXT%. We have compelling breakthrough storytelling, whether it's breaking to or we reached that elite runner and we reached them through a differentiated marketplace. And so we're doing well there. In trail running, which is the fastest-growing segment, the Peg trail is doing very well. We feel really good about our innovation pipeline and we're increasingly leaning in to the trail running community and to marketplace connection with that trail runner. And then the area that we talked about road running or what we call road running or everyday running, we're very clear we're prioritizing the everyday runner who wants newness and consistency and we're focusing, therefore, on some key models and ensuring that we get in the path of runners. So in terms of innovation, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've had some very good innovation in the last couple of years. The Invincible took some of the performance benefits from our road racing shoes, particularly ZoomX and brought them into an everyday running shoe along with some great cushioning. So good innovation. Similarly, the Infinity 4 brought the React X foam platform, which has got some real characteristics of low-carbon footprint, better high energy, but we're not yet combining those innovations with getting in the path of the everyday runner with a really strong ground game. And so that's what we're focused on. And that starts with distribution, making sure we're breaking through everyday runners shops. So whether that's our own direct channels, wholesale channels, running specialty doors play a really important role. You may have noted we launched the React 4 in partnership with running specialty doors. So that's a step in the right direction, and we're really working to break through in these channels. And then we're working hard to better connect with runners in their community where they are, where it's driving connections through Nike Run Club and our mobile apps being present in marathons and races and just being where runners are. And so in this case, we know what we need to do. We are focused on it, and we are moving with urgency to deliver. Matt Friend : There's also a meaningful opportunity as running influences, lifestyle and sneakers. And as we've had tremendous success from a Classics perspective over the last couple of years, we have a rich heritage of products in our pipeline related to running for decades. And so one of the things that we're also doing is accelerating our opportunity in running lifestyle with some of our best franchises and capturing on that trend and also the consumer shift to modern comfort. And we feel like that one, two punch, as John mentioned, innovation, performance and lifestyle is really going to position us well to take greater to greater - take a greater attack at the running marketplace holistically. Operator : And next up is Matthew Boss, JPMorgan. Matthew Boss : Great. Thanks. So John, maybe could you speak to underlying demand trends as the first quarter progressed? Or any early fall trends that you're seeing in both North America and China. And then multiyear, I'm curious what you see as the next leg of the Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy or just any initiatives that you see to drive further market share gains as we look forward. John Donahoe : Actually, Matt, why don't you take the first part of that and close in on demand, and I'll take the second. Matt Friend : Sure. Well, Matt, as I referenced, we saw mid-single-digit retail sales growth this quarter. And this quarter, we have a unique dynamic because we saw a difference in what we're reporting or what we're communicating from a retail sales perspective versus where NIKE's reported revenue is, and that's because of the restriction of sell-in that we put into place the last couple of quarters of last year. We do expect that to continue as we go into the second quarter. And so we are planning for retail sales growth to be in line with what we delivered this quarter from a mid-single-digit perspective. When we look at the big consumer moments this quarter, 618 seems like so long ago at this point in time, but 618 in Greater China, we were the number 1 sports brand on Tmall and saw impressive double-digit growth over that time horizon. And within back-to-school, we outperformed the industry. And when you look at our performance over the quarter, we saw momentum building throughout the quarter, heading into back-to-school. And so we were encouraged by what we were seeing from a consumer perspective. I mentioned that we saw high single digit to low double-digit growth in our most important partners and strong growth in NIKE Direct this quarter given what we're anniversarying in the prior year. So we continue to see consumer demand for our brands and for our products to be very, very strong. Sport is growing and the consumer is proving to be resilient. There are some dynamics in terms of shifting that's happening from channels. We saw it in our partners a couple of years ago. And this quarter, we are seeing consumers spending more time in brick-and-mortar locations. But 90% of their shopping journeys are starting with digital. And so we continue to believe that our digital and physical strategy of serving consumers at the right strategy to serve demand as we look forward. John Donahoe : And Matt, if we just extend out as you asked a little bit longer term, we step back, we still see the same fundamentals, which are some structural tailwinds in our industry, right? The definition of sport is expanding. And so with the movement towards health and wellness and fitness and new big areas of movement like dance, one of my favorite. We've had a lot of interaction with breakdancing in the last three months here on campus seeing some of the elite breakdancers who will compete in the Paris Olympics come in. But dance, throughout Asia and other places is a huge market. So we just see an expanding definition of sport where movement has become sport and we're at center of that. The movement towards athleisure, right, there doesn't need to be a trade-off between what you wear on the pitch and at work between comfort and performance and style. Athleisure combines all of those, and we are very well positioned to continue to drive that trend. And then the digital connection of consumers means that sport, whether they're watching it or commerce is always one click away. And our leading portfolio of digital assets gives us a huge advantage there. So those are some structural tailwinds. And then we just do - we're in a great industry with those tailwinds. We've got to do what we do so well, innovation plus great storytelling plus great marketplace, we believe will drive real strong growth, and we see great growth in women's. Jordan, we think, has extraordinary growth. Running, we think we have great growth. Continuing to expand the market in basketball, global football. And as Matt mentioned, this driving performance and then into lifestyle is something that makes our industry, our business and our future quite attractive. Operator : Jay Sole from UBS has the next question. Jay Sole : Great. Thank you so much. Matt, you talked about you're seeing underlying structural gains and profitability and margins. Can you just talk about how you're feeling about the long-term opportunity for margin in the context of the long-term guidance you gave a couple of years ago for NIKE's ability to get to a high teens EBIT margin over time? Thank you. Matt Friend : Sure, Jay. Well, we remain confident in our ability to drive our long-term financial goals. And we still believe those long-term goals of profitability are achievable. But the timing is difficult to predict. But the reason why I emphasized what I emphasized this quarter is that I feel - I really feel strongly that fiscal year '24 is a turning point for us and a proof point for NIKE to drive more profitable growth. The structural things that I referenced, the structural drivers, I should say that I referenced, it starts with creating value for the consumer and our products. And we continue to see benefits in our gross margin through strategic pricing and managing the price value of our products with ASPs across the NIKE brand across all geos up this quarter. One of the opportunities we continue to see, and we saw some benefit of it this quarter is lowering our supply chain costs. We've increased the size of our supply chain in the last few years to be able to address the growth that we've seen in our business, both overall and in digital. And now our teams are very focused on driving greater efficiency in the way that we serve consumer demand across channels. And I mentioned a couple of examples like reducing digital split shipments so that a consumer doesn't get two boxes for the same order, the way that we're lowering our outbound fulfillment costs through the investment in regional service centers that are closer to where consumer demand is. And so those are just a couple of examples that we continue to see. And then, of course, we do expect that while the ultimate landing spot of digital and direct isn't as clear, we do believe we're going to be a more direct at a more digital company and a more profitable company. And there's a channel mix and channel profitability opportunity that comes with that as well. So we continue to believe these goals are achievable. And based on our gross margin plans for this year, our performance in the first quarter, we believe we're turning the corner on starting to climb to greater profitability as a company and as a brand. Operator : The next question comes from Piral Dadhania, RBC. Piral Dadhania : Hi. Evening. Thank you for taking my question. Most have been answered. So maybe I could just ask a follow-up, a clarification. Matt, I think you said that in Q1, your partners registered a high single-digit to low double-digit sales growth in the period. I just wanted to understand whether that was their sell-out number or whether that was your sell-in number. Any clarification there would be very helpful. Matt Friend : Sure. That was a sellout number. That was the sales to consumer number. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jonathan Komp, Baird. Jonathan Komp : Yes, hi. Good afternoon. Matt, if I could ask a follow-up, just as you think about the second quarter, given some of the unusual comparisons, would you be willing to share any shaping guidance across some of the segments? And then bigger picture, if you could just comment on sort of the shape of the recovery of the sales and the profitability that you're seeing in China? And any thoughts as we look to the balance of the year? Thank you. Matt Friend : Sure. Well, as it relates to the second quarter, what I said was that we expect our growth to be up slightly versus the prior year. I did answer Matt's question just and I'll connect the two together, but we are expecting retail sales to sell out to the consumer to be in line with the mid-single digit that we delivered this quarter across the full marketplace. And the second quarter is really the last season that we've managed the sell-in to a more restricted level so that we could ensure that the marketplace was set right as we look towards the remainder of this year. As far as the comparisons go, Q2, and I think I referenced the wholesale number earlier, but we're comping about 27% currency-neutral growth in Q2, but what we're much more focused on is the quality and the health of the growth that we're delivering in the quarter. And so as you see our gross margins expanding in the second quarter on an operational basis, excluding the impact of FX, we're up 150 basis points and are really encouraged as we think about what we delivered in the first quarter, the improvements we're guiding to and believe we can deliver in the second quarter and then the way that will accelerate through the balance of the year. So as we get into the second half of this year and we think about our gross margins, we're going to start to see even more impact from ocean freight because those are rolling in midway through this quarter. We're expecting to see lower product costs in the second half and our FX headwinds are going to abate a little bit as we get into the back half of this year. And so some of those elements will drive increasing margin expansion as we carry through the balance of the year. I think the last part of your question was on China and profitability. What I would just say is that we know from a long history of managing this business that when you have a healthy marketplace and you're driving full price sales and you are driving productivity in your retail formats, you're -- you've created the environment that's ripe to drive profitability improvement. And as we look at the momentum that we're seeing in Greater China, another quarter of double-digit growth, we're increasingly confident that we're going to begin to rebuild towards higher profitability in that marketplace. That's on the product and marketplace side. And then also I referenced an example where we're lowering our supply chain costs in Greater China. And so we feel we feel quite good with that as well. Our reported numbers in China are going to be challenging for the next couple of quarters because of foreign exchange headwinds. And so we'll continue to try to highlight the opportunities and what we're driving from a profitability perspective, but that's one of the reasons why our EBIT was down this quarter in Greater China as foreign exchange headwinds as a result of the strength of the U.S. dollar, definitely has created a bit of pressure in the short term. But that's - we're focused on what we can control and continuing to drive a healthy, profitable business in that market and believe the fundamentals for long-term growth and profitability are strong for NIKE. Operator : We'll go next to Aneesha Sherman, Bernstein. Aneesha Sherman : Thank you. So as a result of your direct-to-consumer strategy, you've shifted, I guess, more than 20 points of sales mix from Wholesale to NIKE Digital over the last seven or so years. You're seeing shoppers returning to stores this year. You did make some adjustments to adding physical distribution points. Do you feel like you are in enough physical retail doors today to appeal to a rebalancing of shopping habits? And then a quick follow-up on overheads. You talked about lowering some of the specific costs of direct split shipments and fulfillment costs. Can you give us more color on the investment cycle are on the investment cycle to support the direct business as well as centralized investments like ERP and kind of where you are this fiscal year and next fiscal year? Thank you. John Donahoe : Matt, I'll take the first part, maybe take the second. So Aneesha, again, our entire marketplace strategy is driven by giving consumers what they want, when they want it, how they want it. That starts with our digital properties, our own direct retail, which Matt will talk about in the second part of the answer, but wholesale plays a really important role for us to get the breadth and depth of access to consumers and consumers access to our products. And so as you know, we've really sharpened our wholesale focus over the last few years to focus on fewer multi-brand partners that where we're investing in elevated retail experiences and connected digital membership at scale. And so that's DSG, JD, Zalando, our partners in China. We've got a great launch with Pro Direct, Hibbett will come online with connected membership in October. And so we think there's a lot of growth opportunity with those strategic wholesale partners. We're also putting increased attention on our neighborhood partners who are authenticators. They help authenticate both sport and lifestyle and drive energy and local connections. And then as we said, where we see gaps, whether it's in a price point or a gap in a product segment will selectively add wholesale partners in different geographies and in different segments. And this will be a dynamic thing. I mean we're led by the consumer. We have the blessing of the strongest direct connections in the industry. And with direct connected membership, we can be indifferent about which channel And Matt, you're going to talk a little bit about, I guess, the margins are direct, but the Nike Rise our direct monobrand doors Nike Rise and our well collected doors are doing quite well, and we feel like we're getting our concept right now that we have seasonal right assortments coming into them. We feel very good about our ability to augment where their gaps as well with our own mono-brand doors, also a House of Flight on Jordan. So we feel good about being on the front foot with our marketplace. I think the most wide and connected marketplace offense in the industry. Matt Friend : Yes. And I think I would just add maybe one point and then I'll hit the last part. When I think about the momentum that we've seen over the last several years from a digital perspective. You're right, we have shifted our channel mix, and that's been a consumer-led and a consumer-driven shift based on the consumers' desire to want to connect with NIKE, both through our digital apps and through our stores What we saw this quarter wasn't unexpected for us. And when we look underneath the momentum that we saw in our NIKE mobile app, we saw a strong growth, high single-digit growth in traffic. We saw member activity continue to increase both in terms of engagement and buying behavior and a higher basket size, a higher AOV. And so we continue to be focused on creating the best personalized experience for our members from a digital perspective. And we believe that that's going to continue to fuel growth in our digital business over the long term. I do think this year, the comparisons are going to not be linear as we go quarter-to-quarter channel to channel, given what transpired last year. But what we're seeing from a consumer perspective doesn't shift our dimensionality in terms of needing to do something different in order to serve consumer demand. As John said, we've got the biggest, deepest breadth of distribution of anyone and have the right partners to be able to serve the marketplace. As it relates to overhead, the numbers that I referenced actually impact our gross margins, our lower digital fulfillment cost that sits in our gross margins. And it's something that we've been focused on for some time. We started investing a couple of years ago in regional service centers in North America and in Europe and in pickup points closer to the consumer in Europe, all with the intention of building a supply chain that enables us to serve demand closer to consumers. It's more sustainable because we don't have to put product on airplanes, and leveraging our store footprint through O2O capabilities. And so we've been investing for a few years in developing and scaling those capabilities to be able to serve consumer demand. And as I look forward from here, our investments will be aligned with the way that we grow the business. In other words, we've invested to - and now we're learning to operationalize and take advantage of these capabilities. We are implementing our ERP in North America. We went live with our retail business in the first quarter, and everything has gone well. And we're focused on bringing the second part of our North America business, the wholesale side of our North America business online and our new ERP later this year. So that is our largest investment in transformation of our supply chain and enabling us to operate like a retailer. And I couldn't be more excited about the opportunity that it presents for us to really modernize the way we work and to serve consumers at speed across the marketplace. Operator : And everyone, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. It also concludes our conference for today. We would like to thank you all for your participation.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to NIKE Incorporated Fiscal 2024 Second Quarter Conference Call. For those who want to reference today's press release, you'll find it at investors.nike.com. Leading today's call is Paul Trussell, Vice President of Corporate Finance and Treasurer. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Paul Trussell. Paul Trussell : Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE Inc's Fiscal 2024 Second Quarter Results. Joining us on today's call will be NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe; and our CFO, Matt Friend. Before we begin, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations and those statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in NIKE's reports filed with the SEC. In addition, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures and non-public financial and statistical information. Please refer to NIKE's earnings press release or NIKE's website, investors.nike.com, for comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations. All growth comparisons on the call today are presented on a year-over-over basis and are currency neutral, unless otherwise noted. We will start with prepared remarks and then open up for questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time. So, we would appreciate you limiting your initial question to one. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe. John Donahoe : Thank you, Paul, and hello to everyone on today's call. NIKE is the market leader in sport. It's a role we take seriously. We create innovation that pushes human potential. We expand the world of sport inviting new generations all around the globe into the community of athletes. And we fuel the energy and excitement of sport itself, both on a global stage and on-the-ground in community and cities everywhere. One thing that distinguishes NIKE, more than any other brand in the world is that we get our inspiration from athletes and sport. And it was a great quarter for NIKE and the athletes who inspire us. Here's just a few examples. Kelvin Kiptum broke the marathon world record wearing the Alphafly 3, which built on our proprietary system of speed that continues to set the standard. A'ja Wilson earned WNBA Finals MVP after leading the Las Vegas Aces to their second straight title. LeBron James and Anthony Davis led the Lakers to the first ever NBA in-season tournament championship. Aitana Bonmati won the Women's Ballon d'Or and Sha'Carri Richardson was named USA Track and Field Female Athlete of the Year. Being inspired by world-class athletes like these, keeps us focused on what's - redefining what's possible. That's what sets us apart. No one changes the game like NIKE, from our breakthrough innovation for toddlers with the Swoosh 1 shoe to being able to elevate beloved products like Toby's into an entire franchise to NBA players increasingly choosing to play in the Sabrina 1, a shoe deeply resonating across gender. Again and again it's NIKE that pushes what's possible to break the status quo. Now in addition to creating best-in-class innovation, great companies must also focus on strong execution. And that's what we did in Q2, delivering our second $13 billion quarter. This one on top of last year's extraordinary 27% growth and we drove more than 20% growth in earnings per share this quarter. Simply put, this is the result of relentless execution by our team in an uneven macro backdrop. Looking at holiday, we outpaced the industry, driving growth of close to 10%. NIKE Digital had its strongest Black Friday week ever and a record number of consumers shopped in our stores over the long Thanksgiving weekend. And in Greater China, brick-and-mortar grew double-digits during National Day holiday and NIKE once again outperformed the industry during Double Eleven is the number one sport brand on Tmall. These holiday results when combined with Q2's earnings growth and our continued healthy inventory, showcase how we're executing against our priorities even in the face of a highly promotional environment and increasing macro volatility. Last quarter, I talked about how we're getting back on our front foot, accelerating the flow of our innovation and executing with excellence across our winning formula of innovative product times distinctive storytelling times differentiated marketplace experiences. Let me give you a few examples of where we demonstrated progress. Within our running business, we are driving deeper connections with the running community. We recently launched our most innovative trail shoe yet, the Ultrafly at the world's Pinnacle trail race. We hosted over 1,000 runners for uniquely NIKE experience which drove energy and positive feedback from both elite runners and the broader trail running community. And we partnered with top RSG doors for a series of community activations centered on the Ultrafly and other key products like Peg Trail and WildHorse. All this led to growth of over 20% in our trail running portfolio for the quarter. In global football, we're fueling growth through strategic only NIKE athlete storytelling. As you know, we have a three-silo construct in men's football, having paired Erling Haaland with a Phantom boot, Jamal Musiala with the Tiempo, and Kylian Mbappe and Marcus Rashford leading the Mercurial. With the game's greatest showcasing our product superiority and our seamless execution to pull this innovation through the marketplace, all three franchises are up strong double-digits even lapping last year's strong performance with the Men's World Cup. And in lifestyle, we're driving a women's led geo by geo marketing acceleration behind V2K, a standout shoe in our fast-growing retro running line. It's being fueled by a tongue-in-cheek campaign that's resonated with this consumer and a creator partnership strategy that's delivered head to toe style inspiration into her preferred media channels. All this catalyzed the V2K to very strong sell through in the quarter with exciting potential for this style still to come. All three of these examples offer an early indication of the growth we aspire to. We have real opportunity to drive progress across many dimensions of our business and that's our priority moving forward. At NIKE, we'd like to say we're on the offense always. When we see something that needs solving, we don't wait around, we solve it. And so, as we look to the future, we know where we must focus. Three areas will always drive our distinction and competitive separation. Product innovation, storytelling that connects and marketplace execution. When NIKE's at its best, we create impact on a scale that can't be matched, routed in sport, centered in youth culture, inviting consumers around the world into our brands. The second half of fiscal '24 represents the start of a multi-year product innovation cycle that will introduce new franchises concepts and platforms, elevating our full portfolio. And while there'll be some key moments in the second half, this new innovation cycle will take some time to fully ramp up, given our size and scale. Now, we know we have an outsized opportunity to drive long-term profitable growth. And we have areas of significant growth potential like Women's Jordan brand and running, each of which requires focused investment to reach full potential. We also must get deeper traction on our key speed initiatives. Today, we know we must be faster, increasing the pace of innovation, increasing the pace of market to consumer and increasing our agility and responsiveness. To drive this, we will embrace a significant savings plan to create investment capacity to fuel profitable growth at speed and scale. Areas of potential savings include simplifying our product portfolio, increasing automation and the use of technology, streamlining our organization and leveraging our scale to drive greater efficiency. Let me just acknowledge that this work will be led with respect and thoughtfulness as we move to improve the ways in which we work and build a leaner and stronger company for the future. Matt will provide more detail on this later in the call. Now, we've made some progress as we look to accelerate growth in our business. And I want to walk through two key areas today where we're investing for future and further growth. Our Women's business and Jordan brands. Both Women's and Jordan are opportunities that are grounded in performance and the ability to drive culture and lifestyle, with the latter providing even greater scale and growth opportunities. First, let's discuss Women's which is already a roughly $9 billion business and that's just the NIKE brand excluding Jordan and Converse. Our Women's business has grown high single digits on average over the past three years. And while we are encouraged by this progress, we now have line-of-sight into what we believe is the best plan we've ever had to accelerate growth in Women's. Our plan makes us even more confident in serving her through sport and style. Today, about 40% of our members are women consumers. They make up a bigger proportion of new members and their demand per member is growing faster. We see great opportunity to better serve this consumer by responding to her needs across the spectrum of performance and lifestyle. Let me first touch on performance where we're focused on innovating for her to create new opportunities we did not previously served. We've now built a collection of bras and leggings across different price points. This includes our statement leggings, Zenvy, Go and Universa, all of which are above $100, our price point we were not previously in. These leggings serve her with a whole new approach to fit and comfort, thanks to new material innovation. And we're holistically elevating our retail presentation and storytelling to help her find the right product for her exact needs. More and more women are joining our brand by purchasing these leggings. In fact all told, statement leggings fueled our fitness apparel growth in women's for the quarter. And in footwear, we're seeing very strong sell-through for the Motiva, a shoe with a comfortable and distinctive design. This shows how we dimensionalize performance and to walk in. And Free Metcon is also performing very well serving her need for versatility by expanding a fitness shoe into comfortable every day wear. And at the same time, when we look at women's lifestyle, we've established our leadership position in women's sportswear through a focus on style and comfort. With iconic franchises like Air Force 1, Dunk, Court and Fleece, all of which drive continued momentum with new energy and design. And we're also fueling the rapidly growing retro running trend with our portfolio of styles like the Vomero 5, V2K and P-6000. In fact, even with that sequentially increasing the supply, demand for this entire line is so strong, there remains tremendous opportunity to grow further. We're excited to scale these styles over the next few seasons. And so today we're taking the right steps to serve our women consumer with energy and sharpness and we're fully aligned and accelerating our offense to raise our game with an eye to the immense opportunity we see going forward. Now let's discuss Jordan brand, which is on a clear path to become the number two footwear brand in North America, the biggest brand not named NIKE. We're fueling the strong momentum in Jordan by growing a Monday to Friday business with a more diverse product portfolio on top of our very successful launch business. Over the past few years, we've driven strong growth in the Jordan business by bringing more dimensions into the brand. We're proving that Jordan can be more than retro, more than footwear, more than men's and more than North America. And approach to growth will continue to bring life and growth over the coming years. And this is just the beginning for Jordan brand as we see even greater growth potential through our plan for deeper investment, which for Jordan will come in areas like merchandising, marketing and marketplace. For instance, today, Jordan brand performance product is outpacing overall growth with Jordan reigniting it\u2019s on core presence in basketball with the strongest signature portfolio ever as Tatum, Luka, and Zion pushed the brand to new heights, both on and off the court. Jordan is also expanding beyond basketball into, for example, golf, global football and American football. And Jordan Women's and Kids continues to lead the brand's overall growth. Women's and kids' business share within Jordan have increased seven points over the past three years. And Jordan Apparel is now a roughly $1 billion business, averaging almost 20% growth over the past three years. We're also building new dimensions in the iconic AJ1 franchise across high, mid and low as well as through women's led dimensions such as the Elevate and the Brooklyn boot. And I'd also like to spotlight Jordan's strategic approach and success with our remix footwear line which again has already surpassed the $1 billion annual revenue mark with high double-digit growth, led by styles like the Max Aura and the Stadium 90. Remix has increased Jordan's accessibility through more affordable price points and an expanded distribution with key partners. And last but not least, Jordan share from international markets continues to expand as we bring the brand to global cities in an authentic way. This is shown up as we pilot the Jordan destination tab in the NIKE commerce app in EMEA with strong early results and the Jordan World of Flight doors in Milan, Tokyo and Seoul have emerged as the company's most productive retail concepts. The sky is the limit for Jordan as we continue to invest and explore what's possible for one of the world's leading brands. In the end, we are moving with confidence against the opportunities we see. And looking ahead to the next calendar year, we remain single-minded in our focus to compete and win. I wouldn't trade our position with anyone. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Matthew Friend : Thanks, John, and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE's second quarter financial performance reflected our proactive marketplace management and disciplined execution with tremendous delivery by our teams in a dynamic environment. Revenue was up slightly versus the prior year growing 1% on a reported basis as we compare to 17% reported and 27% currency-neutral revenue growth one year ago. Gross margins expanded despite a highly promotional marketplace. And combined with disciplined SG&A management, earnings per share and free cash flow accelerated. As I said last quarter, we believe we are turning the corner and driving more profitable and sustainable growth. At the same time, there were a number of puts and takes in the quarter. So before I walk through our financial results, let me share some perspective on our performance in light of current macro and consumer trends as well as additional insight into our business direction. Now, as you recall, we moved proactively in the prior year to liquidate excess inventory and reduce wholesale sell-in for the first half of fiscal '24. And while this dampened our reported revenue growth through Q2, total retail sales in the quarter grew across the marketplace on top of double-digit growth in the prior year. ASPs were up across both footwear and apparel and AURs grew across channels. Average order values among NIKE members increased versus the prior year. Our higher-priced products, in particular, have been resilient with our $100 plus footwear models, driving strong growth in units sold across the marketplace. And overall, we have maintained lower markdown rates than many of our competitors. In the most impactful consumer shopping moments, NIKE's brand strength created even greater separation. We delivered market-leading results in Greater China and Double Eleven. And over the Black Friday and Cyber Week period, NIKE Direct grew approximately 10% across North America, EMEA and APLA. In Q2, NIKE Direct once again led our growth and wholesale shipments exceeded our expectations. Having said that, we are seeing indications of more cautious consumer behavior around the world in an uneven macroenvironment. Total retail sales across the marketplace fell short of our expectations with softer demand outside of the key consumer moments. While NIKE's store traffic continued to grow, we saw softness in digital traffic and higher levels of promotional activity across the marketplace. As a result, we are adjusting our channel growth plans for the remainder of the year. Looking to our product portfolio, our top franchises continue to drive strong full-price sales, but we intentionally manage the lifecycle of these models across the marketplace for long-term value. Given the promotional environment and the cautious consumer behavior that we're seeing, we are stepping up our plans to reduce marketplace supply of our key franchises. Our goal is to focus NIKE's brand heat and energy on what is new as we accelerate our product innovation cycle. We have seen encouraging signs from recent consumer activations around some of NIKE's latest innovations and newness and we intend to accelerate our pace through the Paris Olympics and beyond. While this will initially take some time, we are confident in our pipeline and the product journeys, stories and consumer energy to come. Now, as you heard from John, our priority is to drive sustainable and profitable long-term growth while building a faster, more efficient NIKE. Since fiscal '19, our investments in accelerating NIKE's Consumer Direct vision, have created new operating capabilities, added tens of millions of new members to our member base and delivered a return of more than $12 billion of incremental revenue. However, we have also added complexity and inefficiency. In this competitive environment, we need to accelerate our pace of innovation, elevate our marketplace experiences, maximize the impact of our storytelling and increase our speed and responsiveness, all in service of the consumer. To do this, we are creating investment capacity to fuel NIKE's next phase of innovation, growth and profitability. We are identifying opportunities across the company to deliver up to $2 billion in cumulative cost-savings over the next three years, both up and down our P&L and across our value chain. Some examples include simplifying our product assortment, improving supply-chain efficiency, leveraging our scale to lower the marginal cost of operations, increasing automation and speed from data and technology, streamlining our organizational structure, reducing management layers and enhancing our procurement capabilities. And as we look to drive greater efficiency and productivity, we will reallocate and invest the majority of these savings to deliver the greatest consumer impact on our largest growth opportunities. Ultimately, we believe that building a faster and more efficient NIKE will accelerate future growth and innovation and deliver long-term profitability, creating value for years to come. We will continue sharing updates over the coming quarters. Now let me turn to our NIKE, Inc.'s second quarter results. In Q2, NIKE, Inc. revenue was up 1% on a reported basis and down 1% on a currency-neutral basis following our strong topline growth one year ago. NIKE Direct grew 4% with NIKE stores up 9% and NIKE Digital up 1% while wholesale declined 3%. Gross margins expanded 170 basis points to 44.6% on a reported basis, driven by strategic pricing actions, lower ocean freight rates, improved supply-chain efficiency and modest markdown improvements, partially offset by higher product input costs. This included impact from approximately 60 basis points of unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates. SG&A grew 1% on a reported basis, favorable to our expectations through disciplined expense management and some shifts in timing of spending. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.9% compared to 19.3% for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share was $1.03, up 21% year-over-year. NIKE inventory dollars are down 14% versus the prior year and down high-single-digits versus the prior quarter. In total, NIKE inventory dollars are down over $1.5 billion from the peak at the end of Q1 in the prior year with days in inventory continuing to improve. Total footwear and apparel inventory units across the marketplace are down double-digits versus the prior year. Now let me turn to our operating segments. In North America, Q2 revenue declined 3% with wholesale down 9% versus the prior year. NIKE Direct grew 3% with NIKE stores up 4% and NIKE Digital up 2%. EBIT grew 2% on a reported basis. This follows extraordinary growth in Q2 of fiscal '23 with North America revenue up 31%, NIKE Direct up 23%, NIKE Digital up 31% and wholesale up 37%. This quarter we saw mid-single-digit retail sales growth with key partners including Dick's Sporting Goods, JD Finish Line and Hibbett. Jordan and Women's led our momentum in the marketplace with Jordan Remix footwear grew double-digits and the AJ 11 Gratitude release delivered the brand's largest shock drop ever. Within Women's, Dunk, Free Metcon and our $100 plus statement leggings delivered strong growth. In addition, Structure 25 and Vomero 17, our latest updates for everyday runners, drove positive response from consumers and running specialty partners. In EMEA, Q2 revenue declined 3% with wholesale down 8%. NIKE Direct was up 7% as NIKE stores grew 8% and NIKE Digital grew 7%. EBIT declined 6% on a reported basis. As a reminder, this also compares to tremendous growth in Q2 of fiscal '23 with EMEA revenue up 33%, NIKE Direct up 44%, NIKE Digital up 62% and wholesale up 28%. Against the backdrop of increased macro headwinds, we saw strong consumer response to newness and premium innovation. Our winterized running products drove positive sell-through along with strong growth from Invincible, Vaporfly and Ultrafly. Mercurial and Phantom and Tiempo grew double-digits. And our retro running styles including V2K, P-6000 and Shocks continue to energize the marketplace. In Greater China, Q2 revenue grew 8% and wholesale grew 19%. NIKE Direct declined 4% with NIKE stores growing 16% and NIKE Digital declining 22%. EBIT grew 1% on a reported basis with multiple points of impact from foreign exchange. On the whole, we are seeing a highly promotional marketplace with increased macro headwinds, especially on Digital. That said, Q2 was another strong quarter in brick-and-mortar with continued improvement in full-price sales and sales in NIKE owned and partner doors growing mid-teens versus the prior year. We also continue to see strong momentum with key strategic partners, including Topsports and Pou Sheng. And NIKE continues to strengthen its lead as Chinese consumers number one cool and favorite brand. Turning to our product portfolio, performance outpaced lifestyle this quarter with innovation and hyper-local storytelling resonating with consumers. We saw strong momentum in basketball, fitness, retro running footwear and winterized apparel. Locally inspired express lane collections including our street dance inspired Dunk and hyper-local Pegasus releases were top choices for consumers. And overall, our inventory remains healthy with units down and improved markdown rates versus the prior year. Looking ahead, we continue to closely monitor the operating environment. However, we remain confident in NIKE's brand strength, our deep consumer connections and our foundation for long-term growth in China. In APLA, Q2 revenue grew 10% and wholesale grew 7%. NIKE Direct grew 15% as NIKE stores grew 17% and NIKE Digital grew 14%. EBIT grew 7% on a reported basis. Southeast Asia and India, Korea and Mexico grew double-digits, leading a record quarter for the geography. Our Flipkart and Myntra platforms drove strong growth in India. Korea led record member days sales in the geography. And Mexico accelerated its digital momentum over the Buen Fin shopping holiday. We saw strong momentum across our portfolio led by Jordan & Kids. Jordan brand delivered strong growth in Remix footwear, AJ1 essentials and Signature basketball. In kids, lifestyle and global football grew double-digits with positive momentum from all kids' Fleece, Court Borough and the Mercurial. All told, our team executed with tremendous focus and agility to deliver our Q2 results, while managing through volatility. Last quarter, as I provided guidance, I highlighted a number of risks in our operating environment, including the effects of a stronger US dollar on foreign currency translation, consumer demand over the holiday season and our second half wholesale order books. Looking forward, the impact of these risks is becoming clear. And as a result, we are adjusting our full-year financial outlook. Looking through the balance of the year, we expect Q3 reported revenue to be slightly negative as we again compare to double-digit growth in the prior year and Q4 reported revenue to be up low-single digits with full-year reported revenue now growing approximately 1%. This new outlook reflects increased macro headwinds, particularly in Greater China and EMEA, adjusted digital growth plans based on recent digital traffic softness and higher marketplace promotions, lifecycle management of key product franchises and a stronger US dollar that has negatively impacted second half reported revenue versus 90 days ago. I will also remind you that there are approximately 400 basis points of headwinds from supply disruptions and accelerated liquidation in the prior year. We expect increased gross margin expansion in our second half with Q3 margins expanding 160 to 180 basis points and Q4 margins expanding 225 to 250 basis points. We continue to expect full year gross margins to expand 140 to 160 basis points. This reflects benefits from strategic price increases, improved ocean freight rates and supply chain efficiency, partially offset by higher product input costs and approximately 60 basis points of impact from foreign exchange headwinds. We expect full year SG&A growth to improve to low-single digits, excluding restructuring charges as we continue to tightly manage expenses and improve productivity and efficiency. Specifically, we expect SG&A dollars in both Q3 and Q4 to be modestly above our first half run-rate, excluding the charge. We anticipate a restructuring charge of $400 million to $450 million in our second half, primarily related to severance costs, which will be recognized largely in the third quarter. We expect full year SG&A including the restructuring charge to grow mid-single digits. We now expect other income and expense, including net interest income to be $275 million to $325 million for the full year. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the high-teens range. Taken altogether, strong gross margin execution and disciplined cost controls are enabling us to offset softer second half revenue and drive earnings growth. Excluding restructuring charges, we expect to deliver on our prior full-year earnings outlook. While we expect the operating environment to remain dynamic, we have been here before and we know that moments like this are when NIKE operates and execute at its best. We will stay on the offense, manage risk, optimize opportunity and leverage our strengths to create even further competitive separation. As we move forward, our focus is building a faster, more efficient NIKE and embracing the opportunities in front of us to accelerate sustainable and more profitable growth. So with that, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open. Matthew Boss : Great. Thanks. So two part question. John, could you maybe elaborate on the structural changes that you cited that maybe in the pivot to the front foot on innovation? Just the structural changes that you see supporting that. And what that means for the product pipeline as we think to next year? And then Matt, maybe footing that portion of the press release relative to the commentary around the second half. Just how best to foot this? And could you help break down the change in your second quarter revenue -- your second half revenue outlook between retail and wholesale? Matthew Friend : Sure. John Donahoe : You want to go first, Matt. All right. Matthew Friend : Yeah, let me go ahead and start, Matt, talking a bit about the environment that we're operating in right now and what's changed and what we're seeing. We obviously delivered a strong quarter and delivered revenue in line with the guidance we gave 90 days ago and are incredibly pleased with the disciplined execution and management of the marketplace, including our inventory being down 14% and NIKE plus partner inventory being down double-digits versus the prior year. But what we saw in the quarter was a bifurcation of performance. And specifically what I mean is that we saw incredibly strong performance for the NIKE brand over the largest consumer moments if you book in from back-to-school in the prior quarter through Black Friday and Cyber Monday this quarter. But in the periods in between, we saw softer performance in the marketplace. And as a result of that, total retail sales in the quarter were below the expectations that we set for ourselves 90 days ago. As a result of that, and specifically considering the promotional activity we see in the marketplace and some of the softness in digital, we've lowered our guidance for the balance of this year and provided a little bit of sharpness for you on Q3 and Q4, in particular. Q3 really is reflective of the comparisons to the prior year, much like we anniversaried this quarter. But overall, we've taken a more prudent approach to our planning for the balance of the year given the increased macro headwinds we're seeing in China and EMEA, in particular, and the way that we've adjusted our digital growth downward based on the traffic softness that we've seen and the higher marketplace promotions. And so, you know, connected to what John will talk about in a second, our focus is on newness and innovation, particularly because in an environment like this where the consumer is cautious and we're seeing higher levels of promotional activity, it's newness and innovation which really creates brand distinction in this environment. And we're even seeing it in the context of recent releases and recent product introductions that we've had over the last 60 to 90 days. John Donahoe : And Matt, the first part of your question regarding the structural changes. You know, as you know, six months ago, we realigned our entire organization under Heidi O'Neill and Craig Williams as our co-Presidents. And it is making a huge difference in our focus and ability to execute. And as you know, we're single mindedly focused on aligning our entire team to drive what NIKE does best, innovative product combined with distinctive storytelling, combined with unique marketplace experiences. And as Matt just said, we have a real focus, Heidi, Craig and teams, a real focus on newness and driving our next product innovation cycle, which will elevate our entire portfolio, right. This is what NIKE does best. And we're doing it with consistency and scale where we want to break through. That's our focus. And so you're seeing some, you know, I'll maybe pick one example where you're seeing some early results. Look at what's happening in basketball right now, right? We are bringing fresh, innovative product at scale. So the past six months, we've launched Sabrina 1, LeBron 21, Tatum 1, Luka 2, the Ja 1. You saw Ja come back two nights ago, the Ja 1 on Christmas Day. And so that's creating huge momentum in basketball with great innovation. And in the next three months, we add to that GT Cut which is one of our most innovative shoes to date, the Book 1 which we think has great appeal on and off the court. And, of course, Kobe, which we think has huge potential on an ongoing basis. And so this is driving momentum both on the court through performance, like Nike does, innovation and performance and off the court. And that translates into lifestyle. You may have seen LeBron was wearing the Lunar Roam walking into his game the other night and Lunar Roam sold on in sneakers the day we launched it, two days ago. And so what you're seeing is when we focus our guns on driving performance innovation, translating that into lifestyle, we can cut through, drive, scale and consistency like no one else can. So as we look ahead, we're excited about 10th anniversary of Air Max Day. That's coming up in March. The Air Max DN is our best Air Max product in years. You'll see us really get behind it. That will be, I think, both a successful shoe, but more importantly, can help lift the Air Max portfolio. With running, we'll be focusing on calendar '24 will be the year of Pegasus for us with the Peg 41 and the Peg Family Refresh. And then we're getting excited and gearing up for the Olympics, right, in Paris this summer. That's when NIKE shines its best. You'll see us really using Air as a source of innovation, both in performance and in lifestyle. And so our -- you called it a pivot, I just think it's an acceleration -- an alignment and an acceleration of speed and focus is distinct and we feel it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Binetti : Hey guys, thanks for taking our questions here and thanks for all the detail today, particularly around some of the longer term thinking in the business. Some of the longer-term commentary is pretty helpful. I'm just wondering if we can help true up the margin story for the next few years. I guess, would you -- is the $2 billion in cost savings, we said the majority will be reinvested. If I try to think back to the longer-term target of getting the business to the high teens margins, this should go a long way. Do you -- is your feeling that the net amount of these efficiencies takes us to that multi-year target? And then considering, Matt, the commentary on the second half revenues here, a lot of it sounds like it's macro in China. You know, maybe kind of help thinking about as we look past '24, do you have visibility yet to say, hey, we've got the controllables to help us offset some of the macro pressures that we see to make '25 an algorithm revenue year? Matthew Friend : Sure, Michael. Well, let me start on the margins. You know, I think that this quarter was really a strong proof point with strong gross margin expansion and operating margin expansion. And the team's execution in gross margin, in particular, was really strong. You know, when we look at the drivers of it, it's a combination of recovery of the transitory headwinds which we've been talking about for a couple of years now, but also structural drivers like price increases which we've been able to sustain in this environment and supply chain efficiencies, specifically meaning that we're improving our cost per unit as we deliver product into the marketplace. And so the underlying drivers that were behind our long-term margin goals are still there and this quarter is a great proof point as we're on that trajectory. The way to connect it to the safe to invest plan is to think a little bit about the opportunities for us to be -- to drive more profitable growth as we look forward. And I've been talking for a couple of quarters now about lowering our marginal cost of growth. And when I look back on some of the long-term targets that we've given like SG&A as a percentage of revenue being below pre-pandemic levels, we've largely done it. But when we look at our resources today, we see greater opportunity for efficiency and effectiveness and reinvesting some of those resources for higher return opportunities like John mentioned. And so that's really what we're focused on. I will remind you what I said on the call, which is that it's -- this isn't just SG&A. The $2 billion save to invest plan is up and down the P&L and its across our value chain. And so we will see benefits in SG&A, but we really are looking at the business holistically. And our focus as we look forward is to drive more profitable growth over the next several years. We remain confident in the long-term margin goals that we've been talking about. And so as we approach '25, we know that we're due to provide an update on those long-term goals, but we still remain confident on the endpoint. As it relates to the revenue, just hit it quickly. Yes, we are largely seeing adjustments based on increased macro headwinds in China and in Europe. You know, the element that we can control in this is the commentary I made around managing our franchises. We have incredibly strong franchises. In fact, we build dimensions to franchises. It's what we do to drive growth in our business. And we continue to see those largest franchises driving year-over-year growth and selling at levels of full price realization that's above the goals that we've set for the business. But we know in an environment like this, when the consumer is under pressure and the promotional activity is higher, that it's newness and it's innovation which causes the consumer to act. And John just referenced a number of products and product launches in the last 45 to 60 days where we're seeing an incredible amount of consumer energy in response to newness and new stories. And we've seen either full sell-outs or incredibly high levels of full price selling. And I won't rename all the products, but what it demonstrates is what we already know, which is that in this type of an environment, what we control is accelerating our pace of innovation and newness in order to give the consumer something to want to continue to invest in this category. And we think that we can do it like nobody else. And so what you're hearing from us is a controllable effort to accelerate that pace, managing some of the larger franchises and really accelerating as we go forward. That'll start with many of the items we've been talking about in our portfolio through the balance of this year. And then the acceleration you're going to see and feel, especially as we focus our brand heat on this newness, will carry us into '25. We know it's going to take time because you got to scale this newness and the innovation and that's what we're focused on doing. So our guidance for the second half from a controllable perspective is also reflecting on the proactive actions we're taking to manage our product portfolio as we look forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gabriella Carbone from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Gabriella, your [Technical Difficulty] Gabriella Carbone : Hi. Thank you so much for taking my question. Sorry about that. I want to dig in a little bit more on the running category, particularly, you know, how is your approach to this category maybe changed over the past year? And then I know you mentioned trail running. Are there any other products with this category? You mentioned scaling moving ahead, but then you've been seeing good customer responses that you're excited about. John Donahoe : Yeah, Gabriella, we've made running a key priority. We talked about three areas we're really getting behind where we see huge growth opportunity that being Women's, Jordan and running. And as you said, in running, we tend to break it into three categories. You know -- and for us, it starts with road racing. That's the pinnacle, that's the peak. And as you know, in the past three to six months, we are dominating it through the Alphafly 3, which debuted in Chicago marathon. Kelvin Kiptum, as I mentioned in my remarks, set a world record. It's dominating the podiums for both men and women. And that'll actually be launching available to the public in Q3. And as we see people going into racing into the -- to the Olympics, both marathon and otherwise, our performance running for racing is unmatched. And then as trail, as you mentioned, that's the fastest growing segment, grew 20% for us. And we do what we do. It's innovations driving it. So, the Ultrafly trail, which is the first trail shoe with a carbon fiber plate, that's again very NIKE, very classic NIKE innovation, performance innovation, along with Peg Trail and Zegama, trail is growing fast partly because trail running is growing. But increasingly, trail shoes are becoming lifestyle shoes. They're being worn on the streets, particularly in EMEA and in Europe, but also around the world. So, we'll continue to invest in great product there as well as, as I said in my remarks, at our ground game. And then in the road running or every day running category, this is the area where we have the most work. And so we have good product. We had some nice wins in the quarter, the Structure 25 and the Vomero 17, which were our latest updates for everyday runners, they had positive response from consumers and specialty runners, but we're very focused on building out our ground game with everyday runners. And that means getting into the RSGs, back into the RSGs and being present where runners are, whether it's -- not just at the marathons where the elite runners are, but the everyday races in the key cities around the world and the running communities. And you'll see us, we are steadily investing in that and building our presence there. And as we look forward in terms of driving scale in everyday running, as I mentioned earlier, we're focused on Pegasus. That's our largest franchise, one of the largest franchises in running history period. And we're very excited about Peg 41 and updates across the Peg family which are coming in calendar '24. So, a lot of focus. And we'll report, you know, in road every day running. It's going to be quarter by quarter. Steady progress, steady progress, steady progress toward our goal. Matthew Friend : I'd just add too that we're excited about the product portfolio we have below $100. And that product offering that's coming to market in the coming quarters will also enable us to get back on our front foot at an important price point in both -- across in -- multiple markets across the world. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. Please go ahead, your line is open. Lorraine Hutchinson : Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to focus on the China margins for a minute and was just curious outside of the FX hit that you're facing, do you see an opportunity to drive margins in China back toward pre-COVID levels or has something changed that makes that market less profitable? John Donahoe : Well, Lorraine, let me first just step back and look at how we see China for a minute and then we'll talk about margin because if you don't have a great business, it's hard to have great margins. And, you know, the fact is we feel very good about our position in China and our ability to compete. And that has not changed from 90 days ago. In China, sport is back. The China consumer is back out on the street with a real focus on active and healthy lifestyles. You see the government encouraging sport and healthy lifestyles and Gen Z is the most active generation ever. So that's a tailwind for our industry. And so even in the face of macro uncertainty, our brand is continuing to resonate. And we're doing what NIKE does so well, which is taking global products, global innovations, global brand, global athletes and powerfully combining them and connecting them to local culture and local sport and local consumer moments. And a wonderful example last quarter is that Eliud Kipchoge, the world's best marathoner, did a tour through China right before the China -- the Shanghai marathon. As you know, we sponsored the Shanghai marathon. And sure enough, we dominated shoe counts in the top hundred. We swept the women's podium. And that's bringing energy and running and the lifestyle of running. And it's growing the market. I mean, I think we're in a great percent. We, yes, there's some macro headwinds, but we feel very good about our position and our ability to compete. Matthew Friend : Yeah. And on the profitability side, what I'd say, Lorraine, is that this quarter, if we exclude the impact of FX, our EBIT grew faster than revenue in greater China. And so I think it's a great proof point that we can start to expand margins and move back towards where we were prior to the pandemic. I did mention that the marketplace is highly promotional and we're seeing that especially on digital. And so in the near term, the promotional nature of the marketplace is holding us back. But what I would tell you is that our inventory units are down versus the prior year. Our full price realization is continuing to improve in our stores and our partner stores. And, you know, as we look at the environment that we're in right now, we're not going to race to the bottom on digital. We're going to focus on prioritizing brand health and brand strength. And right now, the digital marketplace, in particular, is a -- is at the highest of promotional activity. And so an element of us revising our guidance for the balance of this year is an acknowledgement that we don't want to chase that. That's not who NIKE is. We're going to focus on innovation and newness and building a strong business in the marketplace on things like the basketball products that John referenced. We're super excited about bringing Kobe to market in greater China. The Jordan business continues to have tremendous resonance there and that's how we're going to grow and continue to compete in that market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Kernan from TD Cowen. Please go ahead, your line is open. John Kernan : Excellent. Happy holidays and thanks for taking my question. Matt, how should we think about operating overhead and demand creation going forward as we think about the overall SG&A piece of the business? There's obviously some restructuring and some cost savings, but is this a time you need to reinvest given the changes in the competitive environment and the need to reinvigorate the product cycle and the marketing. Curious how we should think about the SG&A algorithm going forward. Matthew Friend : Yeah, I mean, John, when we think about the safe to invest plan and the value it will create and the capacity it will create for us to be able to invest, invest at the biggest growth opportunities we see. We don't envision that as being people. We envision that as being consumer facing investment, bringing product innovation to market and having maximum impact with the consumer. And so our goal here is to see a reallocation of resources through this program, so that more of our dollars are going towards consumer facing activities that can have the kind of impact that you referenced. And we believe when we look at the size of the market and our position against some of the categories that John referenced and/or the way the consumer is continuing to encourage us to bring them new and interesting things from a Jordan perspective, we see opportunity to continue to grow our business and that's where our focus is. So I think we're going to -- we're focused on driving more profitable growth. That should mean that there's some leverage in SG&A, but you should also expect to see us reinvesting some of the resources that we're taking out of the business back in things that are consumer facing that have an impact on sport and that continue to enable us to maximize the impact of the stories that we want to tell. John Donahoe : That's exactly why we're doing it, because we want to double down on our investments to capitalize on growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open. Ike Boruchow : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Matt, maybe for you just on the North American market, can you just comment more broadly or specifically on the current state of the inventory situation, maybe both yours and just competitively of what you're seeing out there in holiday? And then just timeline on when you think that the inventory dynamics and at least North America might be more cleaned up or more healthy for the brand to start to, you know, see better price realization and growth? Thanks. Matthew Friend : Sure. Well, so in the quarter, we did see growth in retail sales in North America versus the prior year. Remember, it wasn't a lot of growth because we were comping some very significant growth rates in the prior year. The actions that we've taken on inventory are significant. And our inventory units are down strong double-digits in North America. That's the biggest market where we've seen the biggest movement in our inventory. When we look at the level of inventory in our partners relative to their current level of retail sales, we feel good about the weeks of supply that we have there. And what I would tell you in the large majority of our partners, we also are seeing the highest mix of current season inventory that we've seen in many, many seasons. And so we feel great that our partners are positioned to put our newest and our -- and most relevant product in front of the consumer. We are watching the marketplace closely because my comments around the big consumer moments and the in between periods applied to North America as well. And so we are watching cautious consumer behavior there. But at this point, we feel great about our inventory. And that's why we're so focused on newness and innovation, because that's what's going to pull us through a promotional marketplace like we have. And so there's definitely a lot of inventory in the market across brands, but we feel great about where we are. And newness and innovation is what will enable us to earn open to buy in our partners and will enable us to re-accelerate the top line. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open. Paul Lejuez : Hey, thanks guys. I'm curious if you could talk about and quantify the cumulative freight drag that you've seen over the past two years and the timing of how you will recapture that freight drag in F'24 versus F'25 just based on your recent freight contracts? And what are the offsets as we think about potential puts and takes on the gross margin line '24, '25? Thanks. Matthew Friend : Well, sure. We've been talking about 200 basis points of impact from ocean freight cumulatively over the past two years. And we started to see those transitory benefits begin to recapture here in the second quarter. Some of our upside in the quarter versus our guidance was it came a little bit earlier than we had anticipated. Our rates for this year locked. And so we expect to continue to see up -- to see that the recovery of that in Q3 and Q4. One of the other transitory impacts that we're watching closely was markdowns. And right now, we're only planning for a very modest amount of markdown recovery relative to the markdowns that we incurred in the prior year. And that's just given where the marketplace is. We've decided to take a more prudent approach to our margin guidance for the balance of the year given some of the uncertainties that are out there. So, you know, when we look to the balance of this year, we're encouraged by the second half expansion being higher than the first half expansion. And one of the other things that we're starting to get visibility into when we look at our margins in the fourth quarter is product costs -- product input costs are starting to flip to a tailwind. And so when we think about the long-term margin goals that we have, the teams are executing well and we continue to be encouraged with what we're seeing through this year. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

Before I get into our Q3 performance, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the tragic passing of Kelvin Kiptum last month. Kelvin had just set the Marathon world record in Chicago. He was a world-class athlete and Champion and beloved member of the NIKE family. Kelvin was an inspiration to so many us, and he'll long be remembered and honored for the impact he had both on the running community and beyond. Looking at our business, Q3 performed in line with our expectations. That said, we know NIKE is not performing in our potential. While our Consumer Direct Acceleration Strategy has driven growth and direct connections with consumers, it's been clear that we need to make some important adjustments. Simply put, we need to make adjustments in four areas. We need to sharpen our focus on sport, we must drive a continuous flow of new product innovation, our brand marketing must become bolder and more distinctive. And while NIKE Direct will continue to play a critical role, we must lead in with our wholesale partners to elevate our brand and grow the total marketplace. And this is exactly what we're doing. Starting last June, we aligned our organization to put the consumer and a sharp focus on sport back at the center of everything we do. We integrated our leadership structure, appointing Heidi O'Neill and Craig Williams as Co-Presidents. We've reinvested in consumer-led sport focused teams that are the foundation of our offense, and we're driving our winning formula of creating a relentless flow of innovative product, combined with distinct brand storytelling, delivered through differentiated marketplace experiences. And while we still have much work to do, we are making significant progress. We're well on our way to building a multiyear cycle of innovation that's bringing freshness and newness to consumers. We pulled forward several innovations more than a year, and our intent is to delight consumers and disrupt the industry. Our brand storytelling will leverage our athletes and sport moments to become sharper and bolder, beginning with the Olympics this summer. And we're increasing our investment in wholesale to help us elevate and grow the entire marketplace. We recognize that our wholesale partners help us scale our innovation and newness in physical stores and connect our brands in the path of the consumer. Most importantly, we're back on our front foot with growing confidence in our innovation pipeline. We know it will take some time to scale these innovations, but we see some early green shoots. And we're also carefully managing our most important franchises for the long-term health. And as a result, our product portfolio will go through a period of transition over the coming quarters. But altogether, we are relentlessly focused on driving NIKE's next chapter of healthy and sustainable growth. And we look forward to sharing our plans in depth at an Investor Day later this year. Now as we said before, our success always starts with innovative product. And so that's where I'm going to focus on today's call. Today, our innovation engine is moving with speed. Our innovation, design and product creation teams are working hand in hand with urgency and creativity. They're leveraging new technologies to be faster, more collaborative and more expansive in their thinking. We have many platforms at NIKE that drive growth. But today, let's go deep on our greatest innovation platform and a true source of competitive advantage. Air. Today, as a platform, Air is a double-digit billion dollar business on its own, larger than some Fortune 500 companies. There's nothing like Air. It's a proprietary technology that lets us iterate and revolutionize. It drives breakthrough performance benefits for athletes and defines the future of sportswear. Air offers stability, resilience and energy return, unlike any other cushioning platform. Simply put, Air helps athletes win. Decade after decade, we've developed new breakthroughs in Air. And as we approach the Olympics in Paris this summer, we continue to innovate with Air with a focus on helping the world's greatest athletes compete and win on sports largest stage. And so this summer, you're going to see Air drive major advancements in measurable performance benefits on the track, on the court and on the pitch. In addition to Alphafly 3, which continues to set the standard for distance racing, you'll see Air new footwear that brings elite performance to everyday runners. You'll see Air in football and basketball footwear in new and more visible ways. And you'll see Air in the fastest track spikes we've ever created. You're going to get a chance to see all of these products, in fact, our full Olympics innovation lineup two weeks from now at our Innovation Ignition events that we'll be hosting in Paris. Now beyond creating leading-edge performance innovation, we also continue to bring new sensations of Air across our business, including our lifestyle portfolio. For instance, Dynamic Air, our newest innovation platform is a true breakthrough delivering a uniquely comfortable sensation with each step. It's a total rethinking of what airbags can be. Historically, airbags have been fixed and static, picture inflatable raft, they compress when you step and then immediately return to their original shape ready for the next step. Dynamic Air changes the game. It unchambers the Air to create a new underfoot sensation that's truly responsive. As the consumer takes a step, our new four-tubed air unit allows air to flow freely between the tubes, responding to the pressure of each unique stride to deliver maximum comfort. We will scale Dynamic Air across many of our leading Air franchises, but it starts with the Air Max Dn, a shoe that offers just the latest example of how we're using Air to craft a new lifestyle franchise. I've been wearing the Dn all week. And in fact, I'm wearing it right now. It really is a unique and great sensation. And what's more, Dn's bold style and design identity is deeply rooted in youth culture and the next generation. We're excited for consumers to experience it. And next week will be Nike's tenth Air Max Day. It will be a day when you see us drive an integrated offense of innovation, storytelling and consumer activations that we're very excited about. Air Max Dn will be debuting in more than 4,000 stores globally on Air Max Day, creating impact like we haven't seen in years. When we teased Dn last month, we saw a rise in other Air Max franchises. This is common. Our experience has been that when we launch a strong new product, it creates energy for the whole family. It all speaks to the confidence we feel when we look at our overall innovation engine and pipeline from Air to the rest of the portfolio. Now earlier, I mentioned the impact Nike can have as we sharpen our focus on sport, and the world got a great reminder of that today with the announcement of the awarding of the German football contract. I was fortunate enough to be in Germany for our pitch earlier this week, and I can tell you it was simply NIKE at its very best. It started with our deep and unparalleled commitment to sport. We are the world's leading sports brand, the largest sports brand, the leader in football, the world's most popular sport. Our focus started with product innovation, both on the pitch with unmatched kits and footwear that popped and had style and performance and extended into distinct and fashionable lifestyle design. Our ability to tell stories shown through to make the German team a global brand and make their athletes global heroes and our ability to expand the game, expanding the women's football game and inviting youth culture into football, all mattered. It was a remarkable team effort and a great proof point that when NIKE brings out our best, no one can beat us. And so we feel deeply honored and privileged to partner with the German Football Federation starting in 2027. Before wrapping up, let me touch on something else that's core to our DNA as a company, NIKE'S purpose. Purpose will always be our foundation and remains deeply embedded in our strategy. We're defined by our commitment to the future of sport and service to athletes around the globe and purpose continues to guide us and redefine our own potential for positive impact in the world. We're pleased with the progress we've made against our 2025 purpose targets across representation, sustainability and community. To learn more, please see our recently released FY '23 NIKE, Inc. Impact Report. In the end, we're acting with urgency as we make the adjustments needed to compete and win. And I'd like to conclude by saying that I deeply appreciate how much our team has kept our focus on delivering results amid macro volatility and an organizational restructure. This has been a difficult time for our organization, and I feel truly grateful for our teammates who dedicated and demonstrated such dedication and commitment to our work together. It's thanks to them that I feel so confident in NIKE's future. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Matthew Friend : Thanks, John, and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE's third quarter showcased the operating discipline of our teams as we delivered revenues up slightly on top of the prior year's double-digit growth, outperforming our expectations in North America and more than offsetting dynamic conditions in some other geographies. We executed well to recapture transitory cost headwinds and expand gross margins even in a promotional environment. Our inventory position remains healthy with total marketplace units down double digits versus the prior year and weeks of supply at their lowest levels since the pandemic. Most importantly, our teams are focused on what matters most to capture the strong growth opportunity we see in the marketplace. This means creating more value for consumers by scaling new product innovation, with greater brand impact across the full marketplace with even more inspiration through sport and our athletes. Last quarter, we highlighted that particularly in an uneven macro environment, newness and innovation are what drives brand distinction. Consumers are moving quickly to access new products. Trends are igniting in different places and rapidly spreading around the world. NIKE needs to be faster. And so we are accelerating a multiyear innovation cycle. And while our new product cycle is just getting underway, this quarter showed that we are on the right track. Since the start of this fiscal year, new and updated footwear models have grown into a majority of our top 20 growing footwear franchises in Q3. Added up, footwear products introduced over the past several quarters are on track to generate a multibillion dollar run rate on an annual basis, and we see even more opportunity ahead. On the whole, we see momentum where we are focused most. Performance footwear grew high single digits this quarter, with double-digit growth from $100-plus franchises, including Kobe and Ja in basketball, Metcon And Motiva in fitness and Structure and Vomero in running. Women's fitness footwear grew double digits and key apparel franchises such as $100-plus leggings, continued scaling with strong sell-through. New product journeys from Book 1 to Vomero 5 and V2K, to Lunar Roam and Travis Scott Jordan Jumpman Jack drove consumer energy and ahead of a new wave of Nike Air innovation, the Air Zoom Alphafly 3 debuted with a marathon world record and sellout launches across multiple markets around the world. As you heard from John, we believe the Paris Olympics will serve as a catalyst for our brands as we launch our newest Nike Air innovations for athletes. Most importantly, this is just the beginning. With a growing portfolio of new concepts, platforms and capabilities, our innovation teams are well positioned to continue driving breakthroughs in performance and lifestyle over the coming years. Now to maximize the impact of our new product cycle, we are accelerating several important actions lined up against key brand and sports moments. First, we are elevating and differentiating the consumer experience with our brands at retail, especially as consumers continue to shift back into physical stores. This includes increased investment to support strong seasonal retail marketing execution, breadth and depth of assortment and elevated service and product presentation. You heard John say that we will initially launch the Air Max Dn next week at more than 4,000 doors. We will increasingly leverage our full portfolio of thousands of physical doors to position our newest products in the path of consumers. Second, we are sharpening our brand storytelling to tell fewer, bigger stories with greater reach. We will focus our demand creation investments to elevate our brand and most distinctive products, leading with the voice of the athlete, amplifying our new innovation, and engaging consumers at the point of sale. As we look forward, we see that our Olympics Air for Athletes campaign will be the boldest expression of NIKE's brand voice in many years. Third, we are in the midst of shifting our product portfolio towards newness and innovation. Last quarter, we spoke of our intentional actions to reduce marketplace supply of certain key franchises to ensure they remain healthy and strong, while feeding and scaling new products. Given the way consumers are responding to our newest product journeys, even amidst a more promotional environment, we have decided to accelerate our actions. For example, we are pulling back supply of classics, such as the Air Force 1, and we're reducing supply of Pegasus ahead of launching new innovation in the Peg 41. We've been here before. 12 months ago, our basketball portfolio was meaningfully impacted when we exited a key signature franchise. Since then, we've more than offset that impact by scaling innovation with the GT series, introducing newness to consumers in Ja, Sabrina, Kobe and Book and returned to strong double-digit growth this quarter in basketball. Looking ahead, we expect lifecycle management of key product franchises to create some near-term headwinds, particularly on digital. However, we are confident that we are taking the right actions to fuel brand momentum and return to stronger long-term growth. Last, while we continue to bring operational discipline as we manage our business through these shifts and a multiyear period of higher cost inflation, we are also positioning NIKE for the future. This includes restructuring our organization to sharpen our focus and increase our investment on the consumer and sport, which we believe will fuel our next phase of long-term growth. This quarter, we began streamlining support and operating functions, reducing management layers and shifting more of our resources towards consumer-facing activities. In particular, we are increasing investment in areas such as design, product creation, merchandising, brand and our ground game to drive greater impact for consumers, dimensions of sport and the marketplace. Overall, our focus is on allocating our resources to drive more return while building an operating model with greater speed and better cost productivity as we grow. Now let me turn to our NIKE Inc. third quarter results. In Q3, NIKE, Inc. revenue was up slightly on a reported and currency-neutral basis with low single-digit growth in the NIKE brand, partially offset by declines at Converse. As a reminder, this follows 14% reported and 19% currency-neutral growth one year ago, as we were liquidating excess inventory in Q3 of fiscal '23. NIKE Direct was up slightly versus the prior year, with NIKE stores up 6% and NIKE Digital down 4%, wholesale grew 3%. Gross margins expanded 150 basis points to 44.8% on a reported basis, driven by strategic pricing actions, lower ocean freight rates and improvements in supply chain efficiency, partially offset by higher product input costs. This also includes 50 basis points of negative impact from restructuring charges. SG&A grew 7% on a reported basis as increased investments in demand creation was partially offset by disciplined expense management. This quarter, SG&A was also impacted by approximately $340 million in restructuring charges. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.5% compared to 16% for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.77. Excluding the impact of the restructuring charges, earnings per share would have been $0.98, up 24% versus the prior year. Now let me turn to our operating segments. In North America, Q3 revenue grew 3%. NIKE Direct grew 2% with NIKE stores up 3% and NIKE Digital up 1%. Wholesale grew 5% and EBIT grew 18% on a reported basis. This builds on extraordinary growth in the prior year, with North America revenue up 27%, including NIKE Direct up 23% and wholesale up 32% in Q3 of fiscal '23. This quarter, we exceeded our expectations in North America with strong holiday sales, lighter markdowns than our competitors and unit growth versus the prior year. Inventory is also down double digits at the end of Q3. Kids grew double digits across footwear and apparel with seasonal fleece and performance footwear resonating. We also saw positive momentum in women's lifestyle and fitness with strong growth from the Dunk, free Metcon and retro running styles. Jordan Remix and Sport Performance grew double digits. And in running, Structure, Vomero and the Invincible delivered double-digit growth. In EMEA, Q3 revenue declined 4%. NIKE Direct declined 4% as NIKE stores grew 6% and NIKE Digital declined 10%. Wholesale was down 5% and EBIT declined 6% on a reported basis. As a reminder, these results compare to tremendous growth in Q3 of fiscal '23 when EMEA revenue was up 26%, NIKE Direct was up 39% and wholesale was up 20%. However, sales in the geography fell short of our expectations this quarter as we navigated increased macro volatility and softening consumer demand. That said, newness and brand distinction continues to fuel momentum in EMEA. In running, [self] Alphafly 3's launch energized our road racing portfolio. In Lifestyle, P-6000 and Vomero 5 continue to scale, and fitness grew double digits as we activated our ground game with brand activations and our trainer network. Overall, inventory remains healthy with units down double digits versus the prior year. And as we look forward, we see the launch of Air Max Dn Euro Champs '24 and the Paris Olympics as opportunities to create near-term brand momentum despite a challenging consumer backdrop. In Greater China, Q3 revenue grew 6%, in line with our revised expectations that we shared at the end of last quarter. NIKE Direct declined 1% with NIKE stores growing 6% and NIKE Digital declining 13%. Wholesale grew 12%. EBIT grew 3% on a reported basis with multiple points of impact from foreign exchange headwinds. Chinese New Year sales grew year-over-year with our NIKE and Jordan Year of the Dragon Express Lane collections driving excellent sell-through. And retail sales with our partners grew double digits in Q3 versus the prior year. Kids led our growth in the quarter with performance dimensions up strong double digits. In basketball, Book 1, Kobe and G.T. Cut 3 launch with strong sell-through. In running, the Structure, the Invincible and the Vomero drove strong growth this quarter. And the Jordan brand delivered double-digit growth in women's and kids with consumer anticipation building ahead of this week's opening of Jordan World of Flight Beijing, which will be the brand's first pinnacle retail concept in China. In APLA, Q3 revenue grew 4%. NIKE Direct grew 4% with NIKE stores up 18% and NIKE Digital declining 6%. Wholesale grew 3% and EBIT declined 3% on a reported basis. In Central and South America, we delivered double-digit growth and improved return on sales in the first full year of our shift to a distributor model. In Mexico, we gained brand strength and momentum with strong growth in football. And in Japan, running grew double digits. Across the APLA, football and basketball grew double digits, fueled by the Mercurial, LeBron and the GT series. And women's holistic fitness grew across all channels with Motiva and statement leggings, in particular, resonating. Now let me turn to our financial outlook. As we look forward, we are driving earnings growth and offsetting softer second half revenue with strong gross margin execution, disciplined cost controls and healthy and more productive inventory levels across the marketplace. Excluding restructuring charges, we expect to deliver on the full year earnings outlook that we communicated at the beginning of this fiscal year. More specifically, for the full year, we continue to expect revenue to grow approximately 1%. We now expect Q4 revenue to be up slightly reflecting some shipment timing benefits in Q3 and lower digital growth due to franchise lifecycle management. Q4 also has one point of negative impact on reported revenue from a stronger U.S. dollar. Moving down the P&L. I will note that our guidance includes restructuring charges of approximately $450 million in our second half, with $403 million incurred in the third quarter. This primarily impacts SG&A with approximately 15 basis points of impact to full year gross margins. We expect Q4 gross margins to expand approximately 160 to 180 basis points. This guidance continues to reflect benefits from strategic price increases, lower ocean freight rates, lower product input costs and improved supply chain efficiency. Our outlook is now partially offset by higher markdowns, reduced benefits from channel mix due to franchise lifecycle management and worsening foreign exchange headwinds. For the full year, this translates into gross margins expanding approximately 120 basis points, including approximately 60 basis points of impact from foreign exchange headwinds. We now expect Q4 SG&A to be down slightly versus the prior year, including restructuring charges, reflecting improvement versus our prior guidance. For the full year, this translates into SG&A growing low single digits, including restructuring charges, also reflecting improvement versus our prior guidance. Excluding the impact of restructuring charges, we expect full year SG&A to be roughly flat. Our guidance for other income and expense and our effective tax rate remain unchanged. Additionally, given the strategic actions we walked through earlier, I want to share some early thoughts on how we are planning for our next fiscal year. First, we expect revenue and earnings to grow versus the prior year, with operating margins expanding, excluding the impact of the restructuring charges in fiscal '24. However, we are prudently planning for revenue in the first half of the fiscal year to be down low single digits. As I mentioned earlier, this reflects near-term headwinds from lifecycle management of our key product franchises, more than offsetting the scaling of new products as we shift our product portfolio toward newness and innovation. This also continues to reflect the subdued macro outlook around the world. Most importantly, we are focused on amplifying brand strength and consumer impact, which is the foundation for how we drive sustainable long-term growth. Looking ahead, we are confident in our product pipeline for fiscal '25 and the momentum that we will build throughout the year, moment-by-moment, creating brand impact and deep consumer connection through sport. With that, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jay Sole with UBS. Please go ahead. Jay Sole : Great. Thank you so much. Maybe just to start, Matt, I want to ask you about the fiscal '25 commentary you made. You're talking about low single-digit growth for the first half year. You said operating margin, I think you said grow, actually restructuring charges and EPS growth. Can you give a little bit more to mention around what you expect for operating margin next year, like what kind of growth you expect? Will growth on the reported numbers from this year or will it be sort of below that? And then, I guess just a bigger picture, if we could take a step back. Just talk about the operating model. The company switched to a men's-women's-kids construct a couple years ago, away from the category offense. How has that changed? How have you perceived that change? Has it been what you expected it to be? Does NIKE plan to make any changes to the operating model? Thank you so much. John Donahoe : Matt, why don't I take the second part of that question and then you take the first. So Jay, as I mentioned, we are making, and started nine months ago, important adjustments in our offense. And that started with putting the consumer and sport squarely back into our offense. And so that allows a sharpness across men's-women's-kids and Jordan around sport. And so, there's a sharpness around running, end-to-end, around fitness, around basketball, around football, and around lifestyle. So we brought the best of the category offense right back in, along with the sort of gender umbrella. And that resulted in consumer-led, sport-focused teams that are back on our front foot, as we talked about, building a strong innovation pipeline. And in classic NIKE form, it's not just one or two products. It's building a three-year pipeline so that we can bring innovation season after season in each sport. In fact, we were just, this week, we had 300 or 400 of our top leaders here for spring '25. That addition of the next round of innovation, I can tell you, our teams are excited. And it's not just one season. It's a full three-year pipeline. We're combining that with elevating our brand and bigger, bolder stories, grounded in sport and athletes that cut through, and connect with impact. And again, you'll see that in the Olympics. And you saw that a little bit with Caitlin Clark and with Sabrina, most recently, little examples of it, getting back to what we do best, and we're doing that with brand. Then in the marketplace, while we have a sport focus, we're combining both the best of our direct offense. But a reinvestment with our wholesale partners, so we bring a more holistic offense that grows the market and gets in the path of our consumer. And so, that's what's driving our growth. We've made the necessary adjustments to bring the best of what's worked in our proven formula so that we move forward. Matthew Friend : And Jay, the way I think about fiscal '25, is that we are taking our product portfolio through a period of transition. We talked about this last quarter, in terms of our focus on scaling newness and innovation, and the green shoots that we were seeing in terms of the way the consumer, is responding to the newness that we're bringing to market. And this quarter only gave us more confidence that that is where we need to focus and how we will continue to create greater impact, and distinction from a brand point of view. And so this quarter, we saw a majority of our top 20 growing footwear products, be new products that have been created this year. And those products are on a trajectory to deliver multi-billions of annual run rate of incremental revenue. And that's where our focus is. At the same time, we're managing some of our largest lifestyle franchises, and some of our performance franchises back, to make space for the newness. And that's going to have a corresponding offsetting impact. And because we've been missing some product newness at scale in our portfolio over the last several seasons, these actions are resulting in a decline of low single-digits, is how we're thinking about the first half of the year. But we believe we will inflect in the second half, and grow next year on the top line. And when we step back and think about the importance of newness and innovation, and not just to drive the top line, but to create consumer impact at scale, that's the foundation for us driving long-term growth. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Matt Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Matthew Boss : Great. Thanks. So John, could you elaborate on the new multi-year innovation cycle and how best to think about the timeline for transition to the next chapter of growth that you cited? And maybe Matt staying on that topic, high level, any material changes to consider with the top line growth profile, or your high teens margin target, as we think about this next chapter of growth? John Donahoe : Yes, Matt. Well, I can't tell you the change in the feeling, of our innovation design and product creation teams, getting back on their front foot. And it's not just about a product or an item here and there. It's around building a robust pipeline of innovation. So I mentioned in my remarks, Air. Air has been probably the single largest innovation platform in NIKE's history. And we continue to innovate with Air, both in performance, which you'll see in the Olympics, and you'll see it impact almost every sport dimension. And you get to see that in a couple of weeks and measurable performance benefits. Again, classic NIKE innovation. And then also in lifestyle. Let me just take Air Max DN. We're launching Air Max DN next week, but we already have next year's Air Max and the following year developed, which are further innovations in Air. So that it's not just one year, its three years in the pipeline that we're working on improving and improving and improving, as we bring it with power to consumers. Beyond that, let me take running. I was over, Matt and I were over in the running room. It was yesterday, I think, Matt, wasn't it? It was yesterday. And the three-year pipeline of innovation is clear across Vomero, Structure, and Peg. So we'll have Peg 41 launch in June. Peg Premium will be as well as other members of the Peg family, Peg Trail, all coming in the second half of the year. And we're clear what's coming in '25 and '26 across Peg, Vomero, and Structure. Again, pipeline. Same thing in women's. We went into the women's room. Amy Montagne and team have lined up not just what's coming in the short-term, but what's coming season-after-season, which is what allows NIKE to drive innovation at scale and consistency. Matthew Friend : And I'll just, I'll hit on the question, Matt. On the timeline of transition, I'll just reiterate what I just said, which is we believe that transition is going to occur in the second half of fiscal '25. You will continue to hear us talking about the way we're scaling newness and innovation from this point forward. The products that are already out in the market, we expect to continue to scale. And then John's referenced the DN, the Peg 41, and we've got other things that are coming in the first half of this year. And so that's what we're excited about, offset by the way we're managing some of our franchises. When I think about your question about material changes to the long-term, I'm going to hit on maybe a couple of points here. I think the first one I'd say is that, while our strategy over the last few years has been consumer-led. What I would say is that the - last year or so, we've been more focused on trying to achieve mix of marketplace targets than we have serving consumer demand where the consumer is shopping. And so, there's been more focus on trying to achieve the 40% digital metric or the 60% direct metric when that was always a consumer-focused strategy. The consumer is still clearly shopping in multi-brand retail. And we need to elevate our brand and our positioning, to be able to serve the consumer and to have the maximum impact, from the new innovations that we're bringing to market. And so, those measures are not measures that are guiding our forward-looking plans, okay. The second I'd say is that when we look at the industry and step back overall, stepping back from being in a moment of transitioning our product portfolio. We continue to see strong growth potential in our sector. We think we continue to have industry tailwinds, consumer interest in sport, more people participating in running events and marathons, to more people focused on fitness and living a healthy lifestyle. There are natural consumer tailwinds that are going to continue, to drive growth in our sector, and we expect to grow and to take share like we always have. As it relates to our long-term margin target, I think this quarter and this year, has been a great proof point on us, recapturing some of the transitory cost headwinds that have been in our face the last couple of years. But also showing how we can execute to deliver gross margin expansion, and be disciplined in the way we're managing costs, while we're investing in the consumer. When I look forward, I think we can continue to drive more profitable growth, and the margins that we've discussed and the opportunity for margin expansion is still significant within our model, but having a strong brand is the foundation for us to be able to drive long-term growth and profitability. And we're focused on what it takes through this flow of innovation - being authenticated in sport, and elevating our presence across the marketplace. And if we can do this, we think we can drive attractive growth and high profitability. And when we get to Investor Day later this year, what we'll do is we will update our algorithm and our expectations, over the next five-year period. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brooke Roach : Good afternoon. And thank you for taking our question. I was hoping to get your updated thoughts on the pricing power of the NIKE brand and the markdown opportunities that you see as you build into this new multi-year innovation cycle. Are there any near-term or medium-term offsets that we should contemplate as you work through franchise management and the current macro? And how are you thinking about the most important drivers of operating margin expansion into next fiscal year? Thank you. John Donahoe : Yes, let me start. By talking about pricing power, one of the biggest benefits to a strong brand, an innovative brand, a brand that's continuing to bring freshness and newness to the consumer, is pricing power. And over the last couple years, given our brand strength, we've been able to implement strategic pricing in order to be able to offset, some of the headwinds that we've been facing. But as we look forward, we believe that more newness, more freshness, products that are more connected to stories that are relevant to consumers, should give us the ability on a structural basis, to continue to expand our profitability. And the point, I was trying to make in response to Matt's question is that when the brand is strong, the biggest driver of growth and margin expansion is strong consumer demand for the products we have. And high levels of full price realization. And that ultimately is the fundamental as we carry forward. In the near term, one of the headwinds that we're going to see is that not surprisingly, our digital business carries a higher mix of the biggest franchises that consumers love. And so, as we manage the supply of our larger franchises, we do expect that there will be a near term channel mix headwind, from transitioning our product portfolio. But we view that as being a near term factor, because ultimately for NIKE to grow at the rates that we aspire to grow to, we have to grow units across the marketplace. We have to go grow units in NIKE Direct, through digital in our stores, and we've got to grow units through our partners. And so that is where our focus is, dimensionalized through sport, our fields of play, the way we've always segmented the marketplace to grow. So that we can work and serve the consumer, where the consumer is at. As far as operating profitability long-term, we continue to believe that we can expand gross margins by running our operating model and also driving value out of some of the things that we've talked about in the past, like product cost initiatives to lower our input costs. We're actually already starting to see some benefits on that, in the back half of this year, continuing to drive supply chain efficiency. And then, as I mentioned, the way that we're thinking about managing our SG&A, shifting more of our resources to be consumer facing, we're focused on building an operating model that's got greater speed and drives greater productivity as we grow. And we think that will also be a source of long-term margin expansion for the company. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Michael Binetti : Hi guys, thanks for all the detail and diagnosis about - a lot of the moving parts in the business here today. Very helpful. I guess as we look at the second quarter in a row, I guess wholesale in China has grown a lot faster than DTC. Obviously, that's a very important market for you, a lot of important things for us to think about in that market. Can you help us a little color in the different trends in that market that you see? And then, I guess as we think about how you'll manage these franchises into next year, we've also heard some good growth rates in some parts of the wholesale channel, for the first half of your fiscal year. So, I'm assuming we'll see more of that franchise management on the DTC side. And if so, considering that's an important channel for the rest of the P&L, I'm assuming we can orient ourselves around gross margin pressure, in the start of next year as you work your way through that, before we see the influence of returning to growth down the P&L? John Donahoe : Yes, Matt, why don't I take the first part of that, you take the second. So, Michael, on China, interestingly, Angela Dong and her team and all of our top partners, were here for the last week. As you know, we have 6,000 model brand doors. They were here for innovation. And a couple of things are clear. Sport is strong in China and NIKE's strong in China. Our growth in Q3 was 6%, which was in line with our plan. And we're gaining share. We're gaining share certainly against the global brands, and we're gaining share against the local brands. So, NIKE's brand is strong in its back. With regard to channel mix in your specific question, part of what's driving that is the consumers back on the street. And so, I would say that the physical retail channel in China is stronger than digital. And then within digital, Tmall, which was historically the biggest digital driver, is experiencing less growth. We're still the number one sports brand on Tmall. And social commerce, Douyin is growing. And we're not yet on Douyin. We're just getting on Douyin. And so, you'll see us expanding our growth into social commerce, which is the growing digital channel in China. But I can tell you, Matt and I had a chance and Craig Williams and others to meet with our partners from China. They came away seeing our innovation pipeline that I've been talking about, Matt and I have been talking about on this call, what we've got in store coming. And they, it was the first time they'd been on our campus in four years since COVID. And they came away excited, leaning in. And so, we are very optimistic about the future in China. And we will grow across multi-channels to grow the market. It's probably the area of the world we do that the best. Matthew Friend : Yes. And to John's point, not only do we have 6,000 stores, but China is a monobrand market. And so, whether it's owned or partnered, it's a monobrand market, which gives us the ability to have the best expression in front of the consumers, to be able to direct the assortment, so that as we bring newness and innovation and new stories, we partner with our partners. And the last thing I was going to say, Michael, is just the penetration of NIKE Direct in China is lower than what it is across our other geographies. In terms of your question about where we'll see the franchise management, yes, you're right. It will be more in NIKE Direct. And primarily because we continue to see a heavy level of promotional activity happening across digital, across all of our geographies. And while we continue to see, as we've supplied our largest franchises to our wholesale partners, we're actually seeing incredibly strong weekly sell-through on these franchises. We're seeing high levels, high above our targets of full price realization. And so, our franchises are healthy. In fact, we could sell more of these products if we wanted to. But we don't think that's the right thing to do, from a brand point of view. And we know that we manage these franchises for long-term health. And so, we're focused on scaling the newness and creating the consumer space, for us to tell stories about new things that, we're bringing to drive energy. And that's where our focus is. And so, that's ultimately where our teams are spending their time. And that's what's influencing the near-term transition that I highlighted a little bit earlier. As far as the margin question goes, what I'll say is that we're going to grow revenue and earnings next year. And we expect to drive operating margin expansion, excluding the impact of the restructuring charge. And that's going to come through gross margin expansion first. And then, continuing to be disciplined in the way we manage SG&A in order, to be able to drive more productive growth. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Alex Straton : Perfect. Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple from me. On the front half '25 revenue guidance down those single-digits, can you give us any color on how you're thinking about it by geography or channel? And then, just bigger picture on this kind of wholesale reentering, are you having any trouble kind of rebuilding the muscle there, facing any difficulty as you reenter? Has NIKE's criteria changed at all in terms of how you think about the right partners or distribution going forward? Thanks a lot. Matthew Friend : Okay. John, why don't I take the first part and then I'll start the second one John Donahoe : Okay. Matthew Friend : If you want to jump in on that and go for it. So, Alex, I think the only thing I would say at this point, is the way that we're thinking about the geography splits, is we're not assuming that economic conditions in the international markets in particular get better. It assumes a status quo, relative to where we are today. And next quarter, I'll provide more tangible insights into not only the first half, but our full year growth over fiscal '25. On the wholesale side, what I would say is that I think the biggest thing to take away, is that we don't like the way our brand is showing up in wholesale. And we own that. And we need to focus, on elevating the experience for consumers, when they come into interaction with our brand. If you segment our marketplace by dimension and by, where we sell our units, our seasonal units on a full price basis. Our wholesale partners represent three quarters of the market, from a unit perspective. And so, the importance of being able to elevate, and to position our brand correctly and to tell stories about the products that, we're bringing to market in that environment, is an absolutely critical way not only, to help consumers fall in love with the products we have, but to also give consumers that tangible ability, to come into real life connection with the NIKE brand. And so, what we're focused on, beginning with the DN, is we're going to see and you'll feel the DN launch in 4,000 doors initially across the marketplace. And then when we look at the way we're going to scale that innovation over the next several seasons through product journeys with different partners, telling different stories in different parts of the marketplace, we continue to. We're very excited about the impact that that could have on the market. And we know that it's what we need to do. And so, the investments will be in things like seasonal marketing campaigns, elevating the presentation of our product, investing in the breadth and depth of the assortment, including color, so the consumer gets more choice off of the products that we care about the most, in order to be able to create that kind of impact across the market. We think we've got the right partners, but our strategy and our approach to the marketplace is constantly evolving, based on where the consumer is, based on where the consumer is shopping, and who's connecting most with the consumers. So, apart from some of the areas that we've been talking about where we need to create new distribution, because we see growth opportunities that don't line up with our current partners. Our focus is on our current partners right now and elevating the experience of our brand with them. John Donahoe : And I just build on what Matt said, Alex, the first part of your question. Our partners want us. They need NIKE to help grow the market. They want newness. They want NIKE freshness. They want us to lean in with them. And that's exactly what we're doing. So, the reception has been very strong and very good. And we'll continue to capitalize on that and leverage that, so that we collectively grow the entire market in service of the consumer. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Robert Drbul : Hi. Good afternoon. Just two quick questions from me. The first one is in the running area, you know, when you talk about wholesale, you talk about any progress that you're seeing with the RSG as partners. And then the second question is, Matt, you mentioned just the opportunity or the ability to see a catalyst in sales from the Olympics. Can you just talk about your opportunity to capitalize on, some of those products and your expectation from that? Thanks. John Donahoe : Bob, as I mentioned earlier, we've had a chance to be with Heidi and her teams on looking at the running pipeline, the everyday running pipeline. And there are clearly already some early green shoots. The Vomero 17 and the Structure 25 out in the market today, both growing double digits to very strong reception. As I mentioned earlier, the Peg family, starting with Peg 41, Peg Premium, Peg Trail coming in the second half of the year, the order book is looking good. We're also, in direct answer to your question, investing in our ground game, with more focus and specificity around running than before. That includes being where runners are. So, being at the marathons, at the local races, at the local runs. We had a strong presence of the LA Marathon and activations there with very positive response. In fact, we had a shoe exchange effort that went crazy, with so many people switching over to NIKE, because we're there with them. We'll continue to do that. And then in the RSG channel, as you mentioned, we've increased our focus and penetration and RSG's and other new partners that authenticate our brand. And we've doubled our EKINs. And as you know, our EKINs are the experts who provide our partners with even greater NIKE expertise and personal engagement. So, if you take the combination of strong, innovative product portfolio and pipeline with more ground game and presence where runners are. Combined with a greater marketplace distribution, including RSG's and with our EKINs in the field, we feel like we're already seeing some green shoots of progress in everyday running. And we'll continue to see that quarter-after-quarter. It won't happen overnight, but we're already seeing momentum in North America. And we believe that will continue around the world. Matthew Friend : Yes, Bob. And another indicator of a green shoot for us, is that our bookings for fall '24, which is the fall season coming up in running footwear, delivered strong growth. And to John's point, that's across our $100 plus products, but also us coming back into market with a new line of core running footwear. And so, it's another green shoot for us that we see momentum in running in particular, and one that we're focused on continuing to ignite. And I think the Olympics actually will help that as a segue to your second point. The opportunity that we see starts with our brand. The opportunity starts with our Air for Athletes campaign that we're going to be bringing through the Olympics, combined with the products that John referenced. So, ones that you will see on the track, on the streets, vis-a-vis the marathon, to on the football pitch with visible Air, to the basketball court. With Air being visible, leveraging this similar technology that we've leveraged through the Alphafly 3. And so - we're excited about the innovation we're bringing, but it's an ignition point, because there is material value from the products that we will sell that we've sold in around these Olympic stories, but it's about igniting the Air platform as we go forward. And so, the way we think about it is that it's a catalyst from both a brand and a business point of view, because it will be an important moment on - the world's biggest stage to showcase the best and greatest innovations in these sports. And then, the connection of the innovation, to the pipeline of product that's coming that we expect will drive growth through their balance of '25 and into '26. Especially as you think about the next Air iteration and the one after that, which we already have in development. So, from our perspective, it's a tremendous opportunity to catalyze energy, but more importantly, to reposition NIKE at sport with the athlete and drive the next chapter of growth for us. Operator : And that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to NIKE, Inc.'s Fiscal 2024 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. For those who want to reference today's press release, you'll find it at investors.nike.com. Leading today's call is Paul Trussell, VP of Corporate Finance and Treasurer. I would now like to turn the call over to Paul Trussell. Paul Trussell : Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NIKE Inc.\u2019s fiscal 2024 fourth quarter results. Joining us on today's call will be NIKE Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe; and our CFO, Matt Friend. Before we begin, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in NIKE's reports filed with the SEC. In addition, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures and non-public financial and statistical information. Please refer to NIKE's earnings press release or NIKE's website, investors.nike.com, for comparable GAAP measures and quantitative reconciliations. All growth comparisons on the call today are presented on a year-over-year basis and are currency neutral, unless otherwise noted. We will start with prepared remarks and then open up for questions. We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial question to one. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I'll now turn the call over to NIKE Inc. President and CEO, John Donahoe. John Donahoe : Thank you, Paul. And hello to everyone on today's call. I want to start by briefly commenting on our financial results. For full year fiscal 2024, revenue grew approximately 1% on a currency neutral basis and earnings per share grew 15%. Q4 revenue was flat. For the quarter, we saw strong gains within Performance product. However, this was more than offset by declines in lifestyle. These declines had a pronounced impact on our digital results. These factors, when combined with increased macro uncertainty and worsening foreign exchange, have caused us to reduce our guidance for fiscal 2025. Matt will provide more detail on our results and outlook later in the call. While fiscal 2025 will be a transition year for our business, we continue to make real progress on our comeback. Over the past year, we've highlighted the strategic shifts we're taking as a company, including leadership and organization changes, kick-starting a multi-year innovation cycle, and creating capacity to invest in consumer-facing activities. As I mentioned in last quarter's call, we're making a series of adjustments to position us to compete and win. We're sharpening our focus on sport, accelerating our pace and scaling of newness and innovation, driving bigger, bolder storytelling, and elevating the entire marketplace to fuel brand distinction and be in the path of the consumer. This is our playbook, and we're seeing momentum build in all four areas, particularly on the Performance side of our product portfolio. We have work to do, but we're on it. Our teams are moving with energy and urgency against the opportunity we see in front of us. Now, as we've discussed over the past few quarters, we've been accelerating our innovation pipeline, including pulling forward several innovations, some more than a year. We're moving aggressively to reestablish our innovation edge. We began with a focus on Performance, as NIKE always does. And the early results from newness and innovation are encouraging. Performance grew double digits in the quarter with growth in many of our key sports. And as we kicked off our multi-year innovation cycle, one of our key priorities has been increasing our speed to the consumer. We believe accelerating the pace and consistency of our innovation will allow us to deliver impact at scale, season after season. Now, as you know, for years, NIKE has had an Express Lane, which enables short lead time replenishment and hyper local design. And we'll continue to leverage Express Lane. But over the past year, we have also built a new way of working across the entire product creation process. We call this [Speed Lane] (ph), and it's part of a broader company-wide effort to move faster and be more responsive to the consumer. For example, through Speed Lane, we're leveraging our Bowerman Footwear Lab to accelerate design. We're leveraging advanced digital tools to quicken development. And we're leveraging key manufacturing partners to speed up product testing and production. We've already accelerated a half a dozen models through this new capability. And in the second half of the fiscal year, you'll see other new innovations come out of Speed Lane, including several exciting new franchises across fitness and lifestyle. As I've mentioned, our sharp focus around newness and innovation starts with Performance and we're seeing the impact across key sports. Let me give you a few brief examples across three, basketball, fitness and running. First, basketball, which was up double-digit growth in Q4 across men's, women's, kids and Jordan. This was driven by new innovation from the GT Cut to Kobe's new footwear and apparel to the Sabrina 1, which in and itself has taken 2 points of share across the entire US basketball market, including both men's and women's. We recently announced Sabrina's next shoe, as well as A'ja Wilson signature franchise. And we announced the signing of Caitlin Clark to a roster of athletes that was already the game's best. All this energy will continue to fuel the rapid growth of our women's basketball business as excitement around the WNBA soars to historic highs amidst an expanding fan base. And, of course, this month's Jason versus Luca NBA Finals matchup marked the first time Jordan's signature athletes met on basketball's pinnacle stage. We celebrated Jason's title with one of the Jordan brand's biggest marketing efforts ever. Next, let's look at our fitness business. Fitness represents one of the largest market share opportunities we see as a company, particularly for our female consumer. We've made intentional decisions to make meaningful investments in fitness, and these actions are paying off. Over the past quarter, we saw broad-based growth for fitness led by double-digit growth in apparel. For example, statement leggings, which is a key focus for us, were up high double digits in Q4, led by innovations we've introduced over the past few quarters with Universa, Zenvy and Go. Women's fitness footwear also had a strong quarter, driven by Motiva and the latest version of Free Metcon, which came out last summer. Free Metcon is now NIKE's number one women's fitness shoe, having expanded from the gym to the street. Next, let's look at road running, which remains a competitive battlefield, but we are playing to win. In past calls, we've discussed that we're now aligned, resourced, and taking this challenge head on with confidence. We've been hustling to accelerate our running innovations and amplify our ground game. While our overall running business was impacted in Q4 by our proactive actions to manage the Pegasus portfolio transition, we're pleased that recent new releases in Vomero, Invincible, Infinity and Structure all grew high double digits over the quarter. We're making it easier for consumers to discover these styles by simplifying our running construct at retail as we highlight our best-in-class cushioning technologies. Now, as you know, a few weeks ago, we launched the Pegasus 41, a new chapter for NIKE's biggest performance franchise. Peg 41 pairs Zoom Air with full length React X foam for a ride that's more comfortable, durable, and responsive than ever. It's received strong reviews from industry experts. We supported the 41 with our full playbook, backed by NIKE's most comprehensive running campaign in years, which will last for several seasons. It was also fueled by a refreshed ground game. This included neighborhood activations to drive consumer trialing at scale and building energy across the full marketplace, including NIKE Direct, our strategic partners, and our performance authenticators such as running specialty doors. This energy drove Peg 41 to a strong start, led by better than expected sell-through in both wholesale and NIKE Direct. And our full running journey for Fiscal 2025 goes beyond the Peg 41 launch. We'll be adding several dimensions for Peg in holiday before introducing additional exciting innovations in the second half of the year, including Pegasus Premium and Vomero 18. We're already seeing strong wholesale order book for running across the next few seasons as we continue to take meaningful strides to assert our leadership in this key sport. Now, let's talk about lifestyle where we're focused on building a more diversified lifestyle footwear portfolio that complement the industry's three largest franchises. We're excited about our pipeline of new lifestyle product. A key example was last quarter's introduction of Dynamic Air, our newest breakthrough innovation platform. We launched the Air Max DN globally, and within just a few months, DN has become a top 10 lifestyle franchise in our men's business and is resonating particularly well with sneaker-engaged consumers in major cities. And importantly, Dynamic Air is an innovation platform. We're already working on the next two iterations of Dynamic Air. And we will continue to innovate on this platform, including customizing air cushioning to create unique consumer benefits. Another component of fueling a more diversified lifestyle portfolio is taking advantage of NIKE's unmatched vault. One example is retro running. We saw an opportunity in the marketplace for retro and moved quickly and nimbly to fill it with our Y2K portfolio and consumers are responding. We experienced significant quarter-over-quarter retail sales growth for Y2K and now expect to nearly triple our retro-running business by the end of fiscal 2025 compared with the start of fiscal 2024. Now while we are growing new lifestyle offerings, we're also accelerating planned reductions for our three largest franchises. And this will have a meaningful impact near term on our overall lifestyle growth rate. Now while we have work to do, we are very focused on scaling the newness to offset this planned reduction. And we're excited about the pipeline with exciting footwear concepts coming in the second half of fiscal 2025. Finally, the Paris Olympics offers us a pinnacle moment to communicate our vision of sport to the world. This is led by breakthrough innovation and announced by a brand campaign that you won't be able to miss. We recently unveiled our Air for Athletes innovation at our NIKE On Air event in Paris. And we can't wait to bring all this Olympics product to life across the games and in more than 8,000 doors worldwide. And throughout, our brand storytelling will be bold and clear, with sport and athletes at the very center of it all, from brand voice to retail activations. This summer, we will cut through the clutter to create powerful energy for the NIKE brand. We're back doing what we do best, creating impactful storytelling and ultimately brand distinction in sport. In the end, we're taking our challenges head on and we're regaining our edge. Thanks to the heart and hustle of our global team, we're aggressively asserting the future of NIKE. With passion, clarity, and grit, we're driving this business forward. We're excited about the opportunity in front of us, and we're eager to prove what NIKE can do. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt. Matthew Friend : Thanks, John. And hello to everyone on the call. For NIKE, fiscal 204 was a pivotal year to get back on the offense in sport with consumers, led by an urgency to accelerate our pace of innovation and scale newness across our product line. Today, our playbook is in motion. Our teams are focused and hustling to deliver, and we're seeing positive signals from consumers and retail partners across the world. That said, this quarter we have been navigating several headwinds, which we now expect to have a more pronounced impact on fiscal 2025. Although the next few quarters will be challenging, we are confident that we are repositioning NIKE to be more competitive, with a more balanced portfolio, to drive sustainable, profitable long-term growth. Let me provide some deeper insights into the fourth quarter and the implications we see as we look forward before reviewing our financial results and our outlook. First, after double-digit growth over the past several years, our lifestyle business declined in Q4 across men's, women's, and Jordan, more than offsetting strong growth in our Sport Performance business. Second, NIKE Digital declined 10% in the quarter. Although our digital business has grown at an approximately 26% CAGR since fiscal 2019, we missed our Q4 plan on softer traffic, higher promotions, and lower sales of certain classic footwear franchises. More specifically, these franchises underperformed our overall digital business results in the quarter, especially in April and May, and continuing on into early June. This is even as these franchises continue to drive retail sales growth at high full price realization in multi-brand retail. Third, we experience meaningful shifts in consumer traffic in key markets, particularly in Greater China, where brick-and-mortar traffic declined as much as double digits versus the prior year. We also continue to see uneven trends in EMEA and other markets around the world. And last, foreign exchange headwinds worsened, creating an additional one point headwind on revenue in the quarter. In the midst of these dynamics, our goals to return to strong growth remain the same. Read and react to the consumer, maximize full-price sales across all channels, protect long-term franchise health, prioritize a healthy pull market and create marketplace capacity for new products and new stories coming in fiscal 2025. Therefore, despite continued marketplace demand, we are advancing our timelines to tighten total supply of certain classic footwear franchises at different paces, across different channels around the world. In particular, we are aggressively adjusting our forward-looking plans for these franchises on NIKE Digital, where they have their highest share of business. All told, we expect these actions to create several points of short-term headwinds on revenue in fiscal 2025. However, our past experience gives us confidence that proactively rebalancing our portfolio will strengthen our competitive position and fuel brand momentum as we take the consumer somewhere new. Let me share a few recent examples. Back in fiscal 2018, we recalibrated the supply of select Jordan brand franchises, resetting our launch business and bringing more dimension to our portfolio. Over the subsequent quarters, we turned the page from double-digit declines in the brand to the start of multiple consecutive years of strong double digit growth. And earlier this year, we moved quickly to reshape our lifestyle footwear portfolio in Japan and Korea, two of our most trend forward markets where our teams read and reacted to consumer signals. We reduced supply of some classic franchises, while scaling and creating new energy around other models in our vault. In the fourth quarter, we regained our number one position in Korea in women's lifestyle footwear and extended our lead in Japan with new momentum heading into fiscal 2025. Now, as we accelerate our pace of newness and innovation, the early response from consumers and partners are reinforcing our optimism in NIKE's path forward. First, the sharper focus on sport is creating impact. This quarter, performance grew across men's, women's, kids, and Jordan, across all channels and geographies. And we expect to build on that momentum, leading with Performance in fiscal 2025. We are seeing favorable indicators in key focus areas, including strong double-digit growth in order books with North American running specialty partners in both holiday 2024 and spring 2025. In lifestyle, fresh releases are resonating positively with consumers. For instance, new executions around retro running and field franchises such as Cortez, Killshot, and the Field General are driving strong retail sales growth as we prepare to scale these franchises in fiscal 2025. Our teams are also attacking opportunities across price points, including a refreshed lineup of new footwear products below $100. Building on this quarter's double-digit growth, we plan to scale new performance and lifestyle models in spring 2025. Added up, we expect the business contribution from new products to more than double from the start of fiscal 2024 to where we end the year in fiscal 2025. Last, we are managing expenses tightly through this product cycle transition, while reallocating resources to maximize consumer impact. This is enabled by our Safe to Invest initiative, which is creating investment capacity to fuel our next phase of growth. At the end of fiscal 2024, we have unlocked savings from initiatives up and down our P&L and across our value chain, from reducing small parcel fulfillment costs, to consolidating suppliers, optimizing technology spend, and restructuring our organization to streamline layers and support functions. In turn, we are reinvesting nearly $1 billion in consumer-facing activities in fiscal 2025, which we expect to accelerate our return to strong growth. This includes ramping up our ground game offense and running in key cities, increasing resources in design, product creation, and merchandising for our key sport dimensions, deepening our sports marketing portfolio, elevating the distinction of our brand in physical retail, and driving bigger, bolder brand campaigns, starting with EC \u201824 and the Paris Olympics. Now let me turn to our NIKE Inc. Fourth quarter results. In Q4, NIKE Inc. revenue was down 2% on a reported basis and flat on a currency neutral basis. NIKE Direct was down 7%. NIKE stores were down 2%. and NIKE Digital was down 10%. Wholesale grew 8%. Gross margins expanded 110 basis points to 44.7% on a reported basis, primarily due to strategic pricing actions, lower ocean freight rates, and improved supply chain efficiency, partially offset by lower margins in NIKE Direct, unfavorable channel mix, and net foreign exchange impact. SG&A was down 7% on a reported basis as increased investment and demand creation was more than offset by reductions in operational overhead. This includes impact from approximately $40 million in restructuring charges. Our effective tax rate was 13.1%, compared to 17.3% for the same period last year, due to changes in earnings mix, partially offset by decreased benefits from one-time items, such as stock-based compensation. Diluted earnings per share was $0.99, up 50% versus the prior year. This includes non-material impact from restructuring charges. For the full year, revenue was flat on a reported basis and up 1% on a currency neutral basis. Diluted earnings per share grew 15%. Cash flow from operations was $7.4 billion, up 27% versus the prior year on significant improvements in working capital. Inventory declined 11% versus the prior year with continued improvement in days in inventory. Now let me turn to the operating segments. In North America, Q4 revenue declined 1%. NIKE Direct was down 9%, with NIKE Digital down 11%, and NIKE stores down 5%. Wholesale grew 6%, due to accelerated shipping timing from Q1 of fiscal 2025, and EBIT grew 5% on a reported basis. This quarter, we saw softer traffic in our factory stores, highlighting increasing pressure being felt by the value consumer. That said, we saw a number of bright spots as well, including strong growth in basketball, fitness, and kids, offset by declines in lifestyle and Jordan. Kids led our results in the geography with performance dimensions of strong double digits. In women's fitness, we gained market share in footwear. In men's and women's running, fall footwear bookings are up double digits, led by the Pegasus 41. In EMEA, Q4 revenue grew 1%. NIKE Direct was down 8% as NIKE stores grew 1% and NIKE Digital declined 14%. Wholesale grew 7%. EBIT grew 2% on a reported basis. In a cautious macro environment, we are seeing performance innovation drive strong sell-through. This is partially offset by overall declines in lifestyle, with new product releases working well. Global football grew double digits across men's and kids. In women's fitness, we drove strong momentum in footwear and new apparel releases such as our Refresh NIKE Pro line. In lifestyle, our retro running franchises continue to scale and our Air Max DM launch drove energy with a full marketplace takeover. In greater China, Q4 revenue grew 7%, including several points of contribution from Tmall's earlier start to the 6/18 shopping holiday. Excluding this timing benefit, we fell short of our plan, with traffic softness persisting across all marketplace channels. NIKE Direct declined 2% with NIKE stores down 6% and NIKE Digital up 8%. Wholesale grew 15%. EBIT grew 4% on a reported basis with continued impacts from foreign exchange. Our kids business set the pace in the geography this quarter, led by running and basketball. Within men's and women's lifestyle, retro running styles and our latest Express Lane releases drove positive consumer response. And in men's and women's running, retail sales for our new releases, Structure, Vomero, and Invincible grew double digits. The China marketplace remains highly promotional, and we continue to manage both NIKE and partner inventory carefully. While our outlook for the near term has softened, we remain confident in NIKE's competitive position in China in the long term. In APLA, Q4 revenue grew 4%. NIKE Direct declined 3%, with NIKE stores up 11% and NIKE Digital down 12%. Wholesale grew 9% and EBIT grew 4% on a reported basis. Mexico and Southeast Asia and India led our growth in this geography. And across APLA, we drove strong momentum in performance with men's basketball, men's global football, and women's fitness up double digits. Jordan Brand drove energy with streetball activations in Tokyo and Manila, and market share gains in basketball footwear. Now let me turn to our fiscal 2025 financial outlook. We are managing a product cycle transition with complexity amplified by shifting channel mix dynamics. A comeback at this scale takes time. With this in mind, we've considered a number of factors and scenarios in revising our outlook for fiscal 2025. Most importantly, this includes timelines and pacing to manage marketplace supply of our classic footwear franchises, lower NIKE Digital growth, especially in the first half of the year due to lower traffic on fewer launches, plan declines of classic footwear franchises given Q4 trends, as well as reduced promotional activity, increased macro uncertainty, particularly in greater China, with uneven consumer trends continuing in EMEA and other markets around the world, and sell into wholesale partners as we scale product innovation and newness across the marketplace and finalize second half order books. Taking all of this into consideration, we now expect fiscal 2025 reported revenue to be down mid-single digits, with the first half down high single digits. Foreign exchange headwinds have also worsened and will now have a one-point translational impact on revenue in fiscal 2025. Turning to gross margin, we expect full year expansion of approximately 10 basis points to 30 basis points on a reported basis. This reflects benefits from strategic pricing actions and lower product input costs, partially offset by supply chain deleverage, channel mix shifts, and net foreign exchange impact. We expect full year SG&A growth to be up slightly versus the prior year as we increase investments in demand creation to ignite brand momentum and maximize reach and impact, while holding operating overhead largely flat. Other income and expense, including net interest income, is expected to be approximately $250 million to $300 million for the year. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the high teens range. Now turning to our first quarter, we expect first quarter revenue to be down approximately 10%. This reflects more aggressive actions in managing our classic footwear franchises, continuing challenges on NIKE Digital, muted wholesale order books with newness not yet at scale, a softer outlook in greater China, and a number of quarter-specific timing factors. We expect first quarter gross margins to be in line with the full year guidance. And we expect first quarter SG&A to be at mid-single digits, as we hold operating overhead flat, while investing in key brand moments, including EC \u201824 and the Paris Olympics games. For NIKE, inspiration starts with the athletes we serve. Their dreams motivate us to create the most innovative product in sport and tell stories that reach millions of people around the world. Above all, they remind us of the hard work and the hustle that is required to win. Before I close, I'd like to thank our NIKE teammates whose passion and drive are the fuel for our comeback. The heart, the focus, and the collaboration that I'm seeing from our teams today are my greatest reasons for confidence as we move forward. With that, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matthew Boss with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Matthew Boss : Great, thanks. Maybe John, just to summarize and think about relative to three months back. I guess, how would you rank changes on the macro front and similarly on NIKE execution that impacted the change in your 2025 outlook today relative to three months ago? And then Matt, just on the gross margin, could you just help break apart maybe the puts and takes to consider over the course of 2025 and how best to model the cadence from a gross margin perspective? John Donahoe : Well, thanks, Matthew. We set out our -- what we're calling our comeback plan a year ago. And in the last 90 days, I would say our execution continues to stay on pace. Matt, you can talk about macro and the franchise management impacting the numbers, but on the fundamental things we set out to do four things that we are moving aggressively on. One, put sport back at the center of everything we do, serving the athlete, And over the last 90 days, we've completed completely aligning our organization along the lines of sport, are co-locating those teams, and now end-to-end have clear, what we call, field to play -- sport-based field to play teams end-to-end, which is accelerating our pace and also improving our execution. As we talked about the last couple quarters, we've reignited our innovation pipeline, including pulling several innovations forward. So in addition to launching DN and Peg 41 during the quarter, early this quarter, we'll also pull forward key innovations like the Peg Premium and Vomero 18, which are just two examples of what's coming in spring 2025. And as I mentioned earlier, speed is a capability we're building, which we feel increasingly strong about. And brand is getting strong. With [Eurochamps] (ph), you see our awaken your madness campaign, which is really the first of the bigger bolder brand voice you're going to hear and then we're very excited about the Olympics coming. A lot of the work that went into the Olympics happened in Q4, but you're going to get to see it in a few weeks. And then on marketplace, we've spent a lot of time leaning in with our wholesale partners. We've had several wholesale partner summits. We've had RSG groups, neighborhood partners and authenticators to campus. We're exposing our three-year product innovation pipeline to them. And feedback's been very strong. Our order book for holiday spring 2025, holiday 2024, spring 2025 is strong. And so our confidence is building. So on the fundamentals that we are executing against is proven playbook on a comeback that will take time, we feel like we've made strong progress. Matthew Friend : And just hitting the financial implications relative to 90 days ago. Last quarter we said that we thought revenue was going to be down low single digits in the first half and that included a more pronounced impact in the first quarter. We also said that we expected revenue to grow. And what we saw in the fourth quarter were really two things. One lifestyle, our lifestyle business declining more pronounced on NIKE Digital, specifically in April and in May, and those trends continuing into June. And what I highlighted in my prepared remarks is that, those specific classic franchises that we were talking about underperformed our overall digital business results in the fourth quarter. And so, when we look at our updated guidance of down mid-single digits for the full year, there's really three things that are driving the change. One, I'll start with FX, our outlook on foreign exchange and the strength of the US dollar had a one-point impact relative to 90 days ago. We've softened our outlook for greater China, and that also similarly had a level of impact for the full year guidance. And then the majority of the remainder of the change is related to the more aggressive actions that we're taking on our key franchises across the total marketplace, but really with the compounded impact on total digital. And the bigger impact of this will be in the first half of this year, but we are planning for meaningful sequential improvement in the second half of the year. And that's how I think about the revenue differences relative to -- the revenue differences relative to what we said 90 days ago. On the first quarter, the other impact was timing. And we saw the 6/18 period come earlier into May than we had in the prior year, and that had an impact on Q4's results, but also an impact on Q1's results. And we saw some favorable shipment timing in North America as we prepare to go live with our ERP and also just better general product availability. So that also had an impact on the first quarter numbers. John Donahoe : And I just want to add 1 more thing that you, Matthew, you've heard Matt and I both talk about it. It's an intangible thing, but I think it's just so important, which is, the heart and hustle of our team, which has just been extraordinary over the last year, but also in the last 90 days just accelerating both Heidi's and Craig's teams, the teamwork of how they're working together end-to-end the focus and focus on the consumer, the increasing speed, pulling things forward. There's a palpable shift in the confidence and forward-looking nature of our team. So I want to give huge credit to them, but also just recognize that is so important in NIKE and our teams are, I think, feeling more confident as each day comes along. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Lorraine Hutchinson : Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you provide some numbers that might help us have confidence in the meaningful second-half improvements? How much less of a headwind is there from the sun setting some of these franchises? How the total order books look? And anything you can provide numerically that helps you to get to that back half improvement. John Donahoe : Well, Lorraine, as I mentioned, we've looked at a number of different factors and scenarios as we've updated our guidance for the year. And that ranges from looking at different slopes of different curves of different products over time and developing a perspective on how we think the trends are going to play out as it relates to some of our largest franchises. But those franchises continue to drive retail sales growth and high levels of full price realization in the marketplace. And so the bigger impact on the first half are the adjustments that we're taking to manage the health of those franchises starting first with NIKE Digital. And that has a pronounced impact on revenue, which is creating a more meaningful first half impact. We want to continue to let those franchises in the multi-brand environment continue to have the impact that they're having for our partners. And one of the ways that we maintain the health of those is by reducing what we're offering to consumers through our digital channel. As it relates to the second half, we highlighted a couple of things, but we are planning for meaningful sequential improvement in the second half versus the first half. And it starts with the confidence that we have around the new products that we're bringing to market, the Peg 41, the Peg premium, the Vomero 18, the order book for Air Max DN, plus the next Air Max iteration that's going to be coming to market, plus our plans to scale the innovation and the newness that we've been discussing. And so, when we look at where we are today and the ways in which we're working to drive this plan through the balance of the fiscal year, our scaling of newness is on track. And our teams are hustling to see whether there's even opportunities to accelerate the scaling of that newness in the second half. We are confident in the indicators that we're seeing in the marketplace right now. We gave you a couple of specific numbers as it relates to running and running specialty. But what I will tell you is that, our initial read of our spring order book is in line with the guidance that we're providing. And so we feel confident that we're creating better balance across our portfolio and also building momentum with our wholesale partners. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Robert Drbul : Hi. Just two questions for me. I guess the first one is, when you look at the visibility of the business, I think in some of your answers to Lorraine's questions. When you look at the visibility of the business today, with the shifts that are occurring, can you just talk about how you feel looking at that versus what you saw over the last 12 and 24 months, just in terms of your ability to predict? And then, just the second piece of this is, when you look at the channel shift that is going on wholesale to direct or bricks-and-mortar, the digital pieces of the business, can you just give us any more framework around how to think about the P&L impacts at a higher level? John Donahoe : Sure, Bob. Well, as it relates to the visibility with the shifts, I mean, we were surprised at what we saw on these larger franchises as we are navigating through the fourth quarter and that is what's caused us to revise our guidance. I would say in general, we've driven incredible growth in our digital business over the last four years, and we've had a lot of confidence in our ability to continue to drive those results against the consumer opportunity that's in the marketplace. I think most recently, in the context of managing our overall franchises, the dynamic of increasing supply of these franchises in the wholesale marketplace relative to having the supply of them on digital and the relative balance between those things are -- those factors are what drove some of the volatility this quarter. And looking at the trend in retail sales, but also looking at our overall plans for how we manage franchises, based on our experience of doing this, we've made the adjustments in this forward-looking guidance. And we've been more aggressive with it on NIKE Digital. And so, we're continuing to improve with the capabilities that we're building in terms of demand sensing, leveraging data and insights in order to have better predictability of our owned business. But I feel really good about the adjustments that we're making at this point in time and the aggressiveness through which we are -- the rest of the way that we continue to manage it. I'd also just say that, when I look at the digital business overall, we were already planning for lower launches in Q4, because we had an extraordinary number of launches in the fourth quarter of the prior year. And if I exclude the impact of the biggest franchises on our digital business, the rest of our digital business was healthy. And we were pleased with the growth that it delivered. And so, from that end, we feel comfortable in the way that we're looking at this. As far as the channel shift mix going forward, it certainly will have a headwind in fiscal year 2025, both in terms of revenue, as I just mentioned in answering a prior question, but also on margin. And these products also have an outweighed impact on margin, just given the high levels of full price realization that we've been driving across these franchises. And so, we are planning for channel mix to be a headwind in 2025. But I'm pleased that we're still able to expand margins 10 basis points to 30 basis points in the year. And that's despite another year of about 15 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds. So we are expanding margins as we look towards fiscal year 2025. And we still believe while channel mix may be less of a driver as we look forward, we have a number of other opportunities to continue to drive more profitable business over the long term. And it starts with a strong brand, and it starts with creating great products that consumers love. Matthew Friend : And I'd add to that a healthy marketplace, where it's -- channel mix is driven by consumer demand. We said we want to be where the consumer is, whether that's digital or outdoor or wholesale. And so, we're embracing a more balanced approach to growing the whole marketplace. And a couple of nice evidence points of what I think health looks like is, we've mentioned that performance grew double digits in the quarter. It grew double digits in wholesale and it grew double digits on digital. The first couple of weeks of Peg 41 sold through well in wholesale and it sold well in NIKE Direct, both digital and outdoors. And so, over time, our channel mix should be driven by consumer being -- at the consumer at the right time and given shopping occasion. And so, we think it'll settle out in a consumer-friendly way. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Adrienne Yih : Great. Thank you very much. I was wondering if you can talk about the amount of newness that is coming down the pipeline, kind of over the next six to 12 months. Has there been another time when NIKE has historically launched this magnitude of newness? And how do you read sort of the second degree of the consumer rates as going into the wholesale channel first? How do you read the success of that at the end consumer as it goes through the wholesale pipeline? Thank you. John Donahoe : Well, as we've said, we've said it for now for a couple quarters, we are very excited about this multi-year innovation pipeline and cycle. And it's just -- if you've seen some early examples of it in this past quarter with DN and Peg 41, and as we are saying, as we move into the end of this -- second half of this fiscal year, which we talk about is spring 2025 and summer 2025 of this season, the amount and breadth and depth of the innovation is just accelerating significantly. And at our size and scale, we know we need to both innovate broadly and deeply, but also provide innovations that can scale. And so, we've set a goal of doubling the growth of our new innovations by the end of 2025 versus the beginning of 2024. And we're on track to achieve that. And one of the ways when you ask how do we know that, the wholesale partner feedback on what they see both in the second half of this year and into 2026, because we're showing them three year roadmaps in many cases around running, around basketball, around lifestyle. The wholesale feedback has been strong and their order books, as Matt mentioned a minute ago, are reflecting that. And so, we view our job to be able to deliver season in, season out, strong innovations, also the ability to scale those innovations over time, both to delight consumers and also bring us to healthy and sustainable growth. So we feel very good about the track we're on, and we think it will accelerate as the year goes on. Matthew Friend : Adrienne, I would just add that one element of newness is also in the lifestyle side of the business. Over the last four years, we have driven double-digit growth and created an extraordinary amount of energy. We've created iterations and dimensions to Air Force 1, to Air Jordan 1, to the Dunk business. And as a result of that, we've created extraordinary consumer demand. And so, one element of us bringing newness to the market is actually going into NIKE's vaults, what no one else has, and being able to create energy the way that we've done over the last four years to be able to move consumers on to a new place. And it's something that we can do, that we have a proven track record doing. In fiscal year 2019, the Dunk represented 0% of NIKE's business. And we\u2019ve scaled that dramatically with strong consumer appeal and response over the last three years. And now we're managing that franchise back to continue to ensure that demand in the marketplace is greater than the supply that we're offering. And that is how we're managing these franchises. And so, on the one hand, there's certainly a performance innovation side. And what we showed in Paris and what John was highlighting in terms of what's coming, we feel great about. But there's also an element of NIKE taking advantage of its vault of assets and bringing new innovation, new stories, new partnerships to bring new products to market to capture an incredible amount of sneaker demand out in the marketplace. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brooke Roach : Good afternoon, and thank you for taking our question. I wanted to follow up on Adrienne's question and your comment about the franchise management that you're focused on for FY 2025. Can you contextualize the importance of these larger classic franchises in relation to NIKE's current sales in comparison to historical averages? Do you expect to be remixed to typical franchise penetration rates by the end of the year as you scale these new innovations? And then perhaps a follow up for Matt. Can you provide some additional color on how you're thinking about the gross margin bridge and the tailwinds that you expect from input cost, and pricing relative to some of the headwinds that you see? Thank you. John Donahoe : I mean, these franchises are the largest franchises in industry history. And so -- and they've gotten that way based on consumer demand. And so, we certainly started managing these franchises a couple years ago. And what we were most focused on was the fact that we needed to restrict supply of these franchises into the marketplace, because we didn't -- because we had a gap in innovation in our pipeline, which we've talked about over the last couple of calls. And so, the intentionality around managing these franchises is that, newness is what's moving the consumer, and we wanted to move to more newness. And so, the significance of it is the impact that it's going to take in fiscal year 2025 on our financial outlook as we're pulling the amount of supply down and creating better balance in our portfolio. And when I say that, I don't mean that lightly. I mean, better balance between performance and lifestyle, better balance between high price points and lower price points, better balance between wholesale and direct, even within wholesale, between sporting goods and athletic specialty or other channels. And so, that is where our focus is. And I think the actions that we're taking and the guidance that we've provided is to follow through on those actions. And I've been at NIKE for over 15 years, and we've gone through these product cycle transitions before. And while this is challenging, and it's going to be challenging over the next couple of quarters, our history has demonstrated that when we take action and we do it aggressively, and we get behind the things that are new, and we build marketing and storytelling around it, we move the consumer fairly quickly to a new place. And what we're doing here is nothing different than that. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Michael Binetti with Evercore. Please go ahead. Michael Binetti : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our question here. And thanks for all the details as we look out for 2025. I guess as we look beyond 2025, you've given us a work -- a year where you've got a lot of work you're going to do here. As you know, you\u2019ll have classics cleaner, you'll have the channel mix more stable, you'll have the innovation working. Can you just help us think about within a historical context in the past, I think you spoke to a NIKE that could grow high single digits, but I think in the future wholesale plays more of a role. China maybe doesn't grow what it once did. So a few things like that that are kind of different than the old world. Maybe you can help us think about what you see as the longer term opportunity for this business as channels, geos, and franchises come back into alignment. And then I guess just at a bigger picture, we could see the lab is back at work bringing out new technologies on the performance side, but maybe walk us through how you can use innovation and performance and how you can create the halo for lifestyle, which is really just more cyclical product. I'm curious how you guys look at the catalog and how you lean on innovation to try to drive the lifestyle stuff back to growth. John Donahoe : Well, I might just start, Michael, by saying as we get to a more -- through some of this portfolio adjustment, we still have significant tailwinds in our industry. The fact is, sport is growing. The definition of sport is growing. Healthy lifestyles is becoming embraced globally. I was in China a couple weeks ago. It was very striking, the focus on healthy lifestyles. So I think there's a structural tailwind for the industry. I also think where sport happens, it's one of the derivatives of the post-COVID environment. You don't have to go to the gym or the field. You're working out in your backyard or working out or taking a walk or -- So sports happening in many more places. And that line between sport and lifestyle is blurring with that leisure. And so, people want to look, have great style while they're doing sport, and they want to have sport inspired style when they're not doing sport. And so we view all those things as tailwinds. And you ask about lifestyle innovation, we want to be sport-based in our lifestyle innovation, both in footwear and apparel. And we think there's a tremendous opportunity to do that across men's, women's, and kids, and Jordan. Jordan Streetwear being an example of it. Matthew Friend : Yes, I'll just finish up this question, and then I'll come back to the start, Michael, where you asked. I would also say that the lines that blur between performance and lifestyle are really as much about how consumers are using products. The one thing that's undoubtable is that the consumer wants more comfort. And you can see that across the marketplace. Our teams are absolutely focused on fit and comfort as we bring these new iterations to market. And I think that when you look at products like Peg Premium or even the Peg 41 or the Vomero 18, I think you're going to start to see consumers carrying those over into lifestyle because they're new, they're fresh, they've got a particular look. And so, we're balancing the fact that the consumer is voting for performance and innovation. And we need to make sure that we've got performance and innovation that they can wear every day, in addition to leveraging the vault, as I said before, leveraging the vault to bring classics back, because there will always be a classics business. There will always be an energy business around classic lifestyle products. And we've got a great vault to be able to leverage doing that. As it relates to your question about the long-term model, I guess here's what I would say. We're focused on driving unit growth. And I think I said that a couple quarters ago and the importance of that point was that, it wasn't about one particular channel or the other, it's growing the overall marketplace. And so, we're focused on driving unit growth where the consumer is. And given where we see the dynamics in the marketplace right now, we're also focused on taking back market share. And we see opportunity in the performance dimensions in particular to come strong with a strong pipeline of innovation to come back and to take market share. But this product transition is going to take a little bit of time for us to work through. And so, over the course of the next couple of quarters, we're going to execute the plan that we've laid out here for fiscal 2025. At Investor Day in November, we will provide an updated outlook on growth and profitability, taking into consideration the marketplace dynamics that we're dealing with across the portfolio, where we are in the product transition, and also some of the strategic shifts that we've put into place over the last year. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Aneesha Sherman : Thank you. I have a -- I start with just a quick follow-up. Matt, you talked about the challenge for the next couple of quarters on private life cycle management. Can you clarify, are you expecting this reset to be done by the end of the fiscal year? So are you expecting to exit FY 2025 at a normalized run rate on the top line without the headwind? And then second, I'm curious about where you are on the organizational reset and kind of shifting of the cost base. How much of that $2 billion cost reallocation do you expect to be done with by the end of the fiscal year? Is it going to be front loaded or is it going to be spread out for the next couple of years? Thank you. Matthew Friend : Yes, no problem. So on your first question, the actions that we're taking on NIKE Direct and Digital are more aggressive. And so, the adjustments that we're making to our plan, specifically as it relates to our own channels, are going to be largely taken into consideration in the first half of this year. We will continue to manage franchises, because you can picture a curve that goes up and a curve that comes down. And as the curve comes down, it doesn't happen in a moment. It happens naturally over time as consumers react to supply coming out of the marketplace. But the actions that we're taking are also causing us to look at the broader marketplace in the second half of the year and ensure that we're reducing supply there as well to maintain a healthy marketplace and also to ensure that we've got capacity in the market to bring newness in. So I mentioned that we're planning on scaling newness, that newness is scaling as we make our way up through the year from minus 10 in the first quarter to down high single digits in the first half to finishing the year at down mid-single digits. And the largest driver of that is going to be on the full year basis, the scaling of newness that we're bringing to market. We expect to exit the year with momentum. And that means that we expect the new things that we're bringing to market to begin to outweigh the franchise management that we're navigating through in this year. And as we look forward to 2026, we'll continue to manage these franchises in line with consumer demand. But what's going to make it -- what makes that possible is the fact that we've got more new things coming that we're driving energy around that will be more than offsetting the way that we manage those franchises. John Donahoe : And then, Aneesha, on your second question, the way you asked it, I want to just distinguish one thing. You mentioned organizational reset. That's behind us. And as I mentioned earlier, we are now completely aligned across the organization around sport, field of play. And our teams are focused, they're excited, there's just a tremendous amount of hustle throughout the organization and you can feel it. And so, that's going to continue. So the headcount dimension of the Save to Invest is behind us. And now those teams are focused on driving for the consumer innovation and execution. We'll look to other areas to provide ways of savings, non-labor areas. Matt, you can describe some of these, but the organization is now 100% focused on driving the growth and innovation we've been talking about through our call. And I can, again, just reassure you that everyone's got energy, hustle, and excitement about the future. Matthew Friend : Yes, I mean, we've been focused -- as we've been talking about, about building an operating model that with greater speed and cost productivity as we grow. And so, the actions that we've taken over the past year has enabled us the opportunity to make some bold swings in fiscal year 2025. We've reallocated a billion dollars into consumer facing activities. That includes teammates that we've invested in and product design, building out the merchandising function. To John's point, we have sport focused teams now at global and in the geographies in order to be able to execute this new offense. And we're putting more of our investment dollars in demand creation, while we're managing operating overhead tightly. We did that in fiscal year 2024. You saw even with the restructuring charge some significant effort to manage operating overhead so that we could reallocate resources, as I've referenced. And while these investments will take some time to drive a return, they're absolutely the right thing for us to do to reignite brand momentum and to get us back on the offense with consumers. And so, that's what we've done, and we will continue to manage SG&A tightly, leveraging this program and this initiative to create the capacity for us to invest, to push us forward with the consumer. John Donahoe : As we wrap up, Paul, just one \u2013 maybe just one final comment. This is -- and this is intended for NIKE's team around the world. This has been a challenging last year and so much hard work and energy has gone into it. And I want to just thank everybody on NIKE's team globally for how you've led through this and how you've operated through this. It's so clear to me, and I'm saying this on behalf of Matt and Heidi and Craig and our whole leadership team. NIKE's real competitive advantage at the end of the day is NIKE's people and NIKE's culture. And so, those people and that culture is alive and well and ready to compete and hungry to drive the kind of execution and growth we've been talking about all call. So I just want to wrap up with thanks to everyone on NIKE's global team. Paul Trussell : Thank you for joining our fourth quarter fiscal 2024 call. We look forward to hosting many of you here at the headquarters for our Investor Day in late November. More details to come. This concludes our call. Good evening.

Before we get into a review of the first quarter, let me acknowledge that we are reporting our results in a transitional moment, as John retires as President and CEO; and Elliott Hill joins us as our new President and CEO on October 14th. First, we deeply appreciate John's contributions to NIKE. He has served on our Board, led our company through a global pandemic and meaningful supply chain disruption, accelerated our digital transformation, and initiated new NIKE community investments around the world. We thank him for all he has done to move NIKE forward. As we look ahead, we're excited to welcome Elliott back to NIKE. Elliott is a beloved NIKE veteran, who brings a powerful connection to our employees and culture, a deep love for our brands and a passion for sport. Over his 32 years with the company, he built a proven track record of leading our global teams, brands and businesses with significant expertise in delivering growth by bringing product and storytelling with impact into an integrated marketplace. Our Board believes that Elliott is the right leader to drive NIKE's next stage of growth. Having had the opportunity to work closely with Elliott for many years, he leads with a passion that inspires the best from the team. Our employees' response to this announcement has been tremendous. You can feel the energy and the enthusiasm walking around campus. And we've heard nothing, but excitement from our teammates around the world, including our alumni network, as well as our partners. We all look forward to working with Elliott as he leads NIKE's next chapter. Given our CEO transition and with three quarters left in the fiscal year, we are withdrawing our full year guidance. We intend to provide quarterly guidance for the balance of the fiscal year. This provides Elliott with the flexibility to reconnect with our employees and teams, evaluate the current strategies and business trends, and develop our plans to best position the business for fiscal '26 and beyond. To that end, we have also decided to postpone our Investor Day. Now let me turn the discussion towards our current business. NIKE's first quarter results largely met our expectations set last quarter. We are moving aggressively to shift our product portfolio, create better balance in our business, and reenergize brand momentum through sport. That said, a comeback at this scale takes time. And while there are some early wins, we have yet to turn the corner. Today, I want to provide a deeper insight into the trends we saw in our first quarter. Then I will speak to the portfolio shifts that we are driving and the implications for our near term performance. I will also touch on some of those early wins, including indicators to track our progress. And last, I will review our financial performance and Q2 outlook. Let's start with a deeper look into the first quarter. While Q1 revenue was largely in line with our plan 90 days ago, we delivered lower unit sales than we expected, partially offset by a higher ASP. Traffic declines across NIKE Direct were more significant than we anticipated. We saw particular softness in traffic on NIKE Digital, as well as in our partner stores in Greater China. As a result, retail sales underperformed our plan, including our wholesale partners, with slightly elevating marketplace inventories requiring higher levels of promotional activity in Q1 to drive conversion. This included the back-to-school period as our results underperformed the market. We saw store traffic improve in August and growth in factory stores in Q1, but the overall period fell short of our expectations. However, Q1 showed that we took an important step forward as we shift our portfolio to create better balance in our business. We have been intentionally reducing the proportion of our business driven by our classic footwear franchises, Air Force 1, Air Jordan 1, and Dunk. And as expected, NIKE revenue in Q1 from these franchises decelerated, declining more than the total business, as we tighten marketplace supply. We expect this trend to continue tempering our reported revenue over the coming seasons. Our timelines differ across each franchise, each geography and each channel. Overall, we have taken the most aggressive actions in NIKE Direct and especially, Digital. In Q1, these franchises were down nearly 50% versus the prior year on NIKE Digital, while we saw much better sales trends in wholesale. So we are actively rebalancing product allocations to our highest traffic channel in order to maximize franchise health and full price realization. In the near-term, this will have implications for certain dimensions of our business. Our men's and women's lifestyle business was planned down double-digits in Q1, and we expect these declines to continue through the year. The Jordan brand was planned down double-digits this quarter, and we expect Jordan to be down at the same rate for fiscal '25. And we expect NIKE Digital to decline double-digits in fiscal '25 versus the prior year. All taken together, these trends drove a mid-single digit headwind on Q1 revenue. As we look ahead, we are working to position new products in the path of the consumer, create scale for new ideas, and drive more balanced marketplace growth. Partner feedback on our future product pipeline has been very positive. I had the chance to meet with many of them at our Partner Summit in Paris during the Summer Olympics and directly hear their response to the products and stories that we have coming in our second half. We also gave them a sneak peek to what is coming in fall '25, deepening confidence in our accelerated pace of innovation to build a more compelling future product pipeline. Progress with partners will be accelerated through new brand momentum and new energy with consumers. But the multi-brand environment is very competitive today and it will take time to expand market share. This was reflected in our spring '25 order books, which came in roughly flat versus the prior year, a little lighter than we had planned. Our teams are now hustling to close out the upcoming summer season, closely engaging our partners as we finalize bookings. Now let's turn to some of the early wins that we are seeing, especially, as our teams get back on the offense in sport with consumers. This quarter, we saw growth in multiple sport dimensions, an indicator that we are gaining traction. This was led by men's fitness, men's global football, and men's and women's running footwear. In addition, two of our largest performance franchises, Mercurial and Global Football and the G.T. series in basketball delivered double-digit growth across all channels. We are especially encouraged by the momentum building in our Running offense. This has been one of our toughest fights over the past few years and it is one of our biggest opportunities. Our team's focused here first in driving our comeback. And more recently, men's and women's running footwear delivered positive growth in Q1, a meaningful improvement versus the prior quarter. The order book looking forward is strong with spring '25 footwear units set to grow double-digits versus the prior year. In North America, we were up double-digits this quarter with running specialty partners, and our holiday and spring order books will build on that strength. We also just launched a new campaign, one of our biggest Running brand investments in years, which will carry into fall and holiday. So far, consumer engagement has been very strong. Meanwhile, our ground game activations are creating energy and running communities around the world. In addition, our Pegasus 41 launch showed the impact that we create when we launch new ideas at scale, delivering mid-teens growth above last year's Pegasus model. And this is just the start, as we scale the franchise through multiple dimensions, Peg Trail, Peg Plus, and coming in spring, Peg Premium, which introduces visible full length NIKE Air with more energy return than ever. Most importantly, we are most optimistic regarding the full product pipeline in Running across footwear and apparel that we will bring over the coming seasons. This includes a new maximum cushioning system in an iconic line, blending comfort and style for our softest, smoothest ride yet, a premium model that combines high-stack ZoomX foam and Zoom Air for a new sensation that had test runners raving; a refreshed lineup of performance running apparel, including new women's led designs; the latest NIKE Trail models updated for even better traction and durability, and new franchises below $100 that scale innovation to more accessible price points. Looking more broadly across our product portfolio, particularly in footwear, we see clear indications of progress in accelerating newness and innovation. Q1 revenue from new footwear products was up strong double-digits versus the prior year. This includes multiple franchises that have scaled quickly based on unit growth over the past 12 months. For example, in performance footwear, Sabrina has grown roughly 5 times. Kobe has nearly quadrupled and Alphafly has almost tripled. Meanwhile, in lifestyle, what we call our look of running business, led by Vomero 5, V2K and P-6000 has grown more than 4 times over the past year. While this is not yet large enough to offset the declines elsewhere in our portfolio, we are gaining ground. As we look to the spring season, contribution from newness and innovation will take a significant step forward with growth in footwear units of mid to high-single digits versus the prior year. And over the coming seasons, we expect to see sequential gains and the percentage of newness and innovation as a mix of our total footwear business. As we move forward, we are continuing to invest to grow, while staying disciplined on costs. For our teams, this means tightly managing operating overhead and reallocating resources to maximize consumer impact and growth. You saw that this summer with our Paris Olympics campaign, Winning Isn't for Everyone. We led with the voice of the athlete on sport's biggest stage, backed by one of our biggest brand investments in years, as NIKE athletes dominated the medal count. NIKE owned over 60% of total share of voice during the games, resonating especially deeply with our athletes and Gen Z consumers. Most importantly, this summer was just the start, with the investment lined up behind a steady cadence of bigger, bolder brand storytelling to come. In addition, we are investing with our partners to elevate and differentiate our brand in retail. For example, last year, we partnered with DICK'S Sporting Goods to introduce an elevated women's fitness concept, which is generating impressive year-over-year comparisons in pilot doors. We also teamed up with Foot Locker to introduce a new concept, Home Court, in their doors with a shared vision to deliver a fresh new multi-brand basketball experience. By bringing the best of NIKE, we create sport inspired distinction for consumers and deliver attractive returns for both NIKE and our partners. Together, we shape the kind of retail environments that drive competitive separation and segment the marketplace for growth, enabling us to serve consumers through strong assortments with full expression across each dimension of our portfolio. All told, we expect that the return to strong growth will take time, but we believe that we have all the right building blocks, especially, with Elliott now leading us forward. Now let me turn to our first quarter financial results. In Q1, NIKE, Inc. revenue declined 10% on a reported basis, and 9% on a currency neutral basis. NIKE Direct was down 12% with NIKE stores up 1%, and NIKE Digital down 20%. Wholesale was down 7%. Gross margins expanded 120 basis points to 45.4% on a reported basis, primarily due to lower NIKE brand product costs, lower warehousing and logistics costs, and benefits from strategic pricing actions in the prior year. SG&A declined 2% on a reported basis, with accelerated investment in demand creation more than offset by a reduction in overhead expenses, primarily, driven by wage related savings. Our effective tax rate was 19.6% compared to 12% for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.70. Next, let me turn to our operating segments. Given similar themes across many of our geographies, I will keep my comments here briefer than usual. In North America, Q1 revenue was down 11%, NIKE Direct declined 11% with NIKE Digital down 15%, and NIKE stores down 1%. Wholesale declined 11%, reflecting unfavorable shipping timing. EBIT declined 15% on a reported basis with gross margin expansion offset by higher investment in demand creation. This quarter's highlights included brand activations around a full summer of hoops. We engaged players and fans with our New York versus New York Series, our WNBA All-Star celebration, Jordan Grassroots Basketball in Chicago and L.A., and our Mamba League Invitational. In EMEA, Q1 revenue was down 12%. NIKE Direct declined 12% with NIKE Digital down 24%, and NIKE stores up 3%. Wholesale declined 11%. EBIT declined 15% on a reported basis. This summer in Paris, both NIKE and Jordan were unmissable, with our Olympics campaign just about everywhere you could look : on billboards, big screens, on the side of buildings and most importantly, across all of our retail touch points. In addition, Jordan introduced its new campaign with a six-week District 23 takeover in the city, a global one-on-one basketball tournament, and the brand's first-ever Twitch live stream, which drove over 10 million views, the biggest ever activation for any brand on the platform. In APLA, Q1 revenue was down 2%, NIKE Direct declined 4% with NIKE Digital down 15%, and NIKE stores up 9%. Wholesale declined 1%. EBIT declined 3% on a reported basis. This quarter, we celebrated the opening of our new NIKE and Jordan World of Flight Door in Mexico City, our largest retail space in Latin America and first dual brand shopping experience. Q1 traffic and sales for this concept far exceeded our plan, with consumers seeking out exclusive products, member-only experiences, and our latest women's and Jordan assortments. For Greater China, let me go a little deeper into this quarter's performance. Q1 revenue was down 3%, NIKE Direct declined 16% with NIKE Digital down 34% and NIKE stores down 4%. Wholesale grew 10%. EBIT declined 4% on a reported basis. This summer, retail sales moderated across the industry, and NIKE was not immune as traffic decelerated in our channels with lower sell-through rates. This has resulted in elevated inventory in the marketplace in an already promotional environment. That being said, NIKE continues to be the number one sports brand in China, and we continue to create brand distinction when we bring our best stories and products to local consumers. Over the summer, we drove incredible social buzz with storytelling around NIKE athlete, Zheng Qinwen, who took home gold as China's first Olympic Tennis champion. Jordan's first athlete tour in China since the pandemic was also a big success as Luka, Tatum, Paolo, and Zion connected with young fans in Shanghai and Beijing. Top innovation and sport performance continues to resonate. This quarter's standouts included Peg 41, Alphafly and Sabrina 2. In addition, consumer response to our latest Protro release proved that Kobe remains one of the most beloved athletes in China. While our outlook for the near term has moderated, we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunities for sport and for NIKE in China. Now let me provide specific guidance for the second quarter. We expect Q2 revenues to be down in the 8% to 10% range. We expect Q2 gross margins to be down approximately 150 basis points, with higher promotions, channel mix headwinds, and supply chain deleverage more than offsetting lower product costs and a decreasing benefit from strategic pricing actions. We expect SG&A to be roughly flat versus the prior year, with increased demand creation investment largely offset by tighter operating overhead. We expect other income and expense, including net interest income to be $30 million to $40 million, reflecting lower interest rates. And we expect our effective tax rate to be in the high-teens range. Although, we will not be providing full year guidance for the remainder of this fiscal year, we do want to provide additional color to help you understand our latest read of NIKE's business trajectory, as we see it today prior to our leadership transition. Looking forward, our revenue expectations have moderated since the start of the year, given traffic trends on NIKE Digital, retail sales trends across the marketplace, and final order books for spring. Franchise management actions will continue throughout the year, and we expect a similar impact in scale to what we experienced in Q1. However, we continue to see indications of slight second half improvement in revenue trends versus our first half, as we plan to introduce and scale newness and innovation across the marketplace. We now expect gross margins to decline versus the prior year, due to incremental headwinds based on the previously mentioned factors. We intend to remain disciplined on cost, especially operating overhead, while we invest to fuel brand momentum. Before I wrap, I'd like to finish with this. Throughout our history, NIKE has always faced pressure. NIKE was born through adversity. Every obstacle, every setback was an opportunity to learn, to adjust and to improve. This is the foundational mindset at NIKE, inspired by athletes and competition and today is no different. Adversity creates sharper focus, leading to innovation and new growth. We will continue to address the challenges head on, and we look forward to doing so with Elliott's leadership. With that, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Bob Drbul. Please go ahead. Robert Drbul : Hey, Matt. Good afternoon. Matthew Friend : Hey, Bob. Robert Drbul : I was just wondering, if on the inventory situation, I think you talked about specifically China being elevated. Can you sort of break down some more regional, your perspective on where we are with inventories regionally with some of the -- I don't know, if I'd use the word dislocation with some of the classics, North America specifically? Matthew Friend : Sure, Bob. I'd start by saying that as we look at the performance of our business over the last couple of seasons, retail sales have underperformed plan and that's a statement about the overall portfolio. It doesn't specifically relate to just the classics. While we saw growth in retail sales in North America and China in Q1, we are seeing slightly elevated inventory as a result of the retail sales plans falling behind. And so, as we've looked at our outlook for the remainder of the year and the commentary around trends moderating, we've taken into consideration a more muted point of view on retail sales trends and also the gross margin implications of needing to not only be more promotional to work through some of this elevated inventory, but also acknowledging the fact that the outlook for the balance of the year is going to require us to be more promotional as we're scaling new ideas and concepts, while working through the rest of the product portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Alex Straton : Perfect. Thanks a lot, Matt. I just wanted to drill down on this kind of unit disappointment in the quarter. Have you guys identified what exactly like the biggest challenges or I guess, problem areas are that you didn't expect a few months ago? And then just zooming out, as you look forward, have you guys identified the key metrics that you're monitoring just to gauge comeback progress throughout the year? Matthew Friend : Yeah, Alex. I mean, overall, when we look at the business in its total, we are encouraged by the performance that we've seen on the new products that we brought to market. And we've delivered, I mentioned, we delivered double-digit growth in our new products. And it continues to give us encouraging signs as we see the team's focus on sport and performance, and the way that those products are landing in the marketplace and the growth that we're driving. As it relates to our performance in the quarter and the unit misses, I would start by saying that in Greater China, we did see performance in the quarter underperform our plan. And so that was one factor that impacted our unit decline. What I would say more broadly than that is just general macro across the different geographies. We just saw more softness for another season and so our teams are on it. They are focused on moving through these slightly elevated inventories. They're not in a place that cause us significant concern at this point in time, but they do require us to be proactive and to take action. And that's what we're focused on doing, while we bring newness and innovation at a greater scale with greater impact in the second half of this year. On Digital, we did see, we were down 20% in the quarter in Digital, and that was largely driven by the three classic franchises being down nearly 50% versus the prior year. And the sales trends for those franchises in our -- in the wholesale channel was substantially better. And so that also had an impact on our Q1 results. But as I said, we planned for the declines on those big three franchises, and we\u2019re continuing to manage the inventory of those franchises carefully, beginning with NIKE Digital so that we can put the product where the traffic is, and we can drive high full price realization on that product in the right channels in the marketplace in order to continue to manage the long-term health of those franchises. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Michael Binetti : Hey, guys. Thanks for all the help here. Matt, I guess, just one thing in the near term. You said that the spring order books actualized a little lower than you were expecting. But you did mention some elements of the second half revenue outlook that are maybe a few bright spots versus what you thought 90 days ago. Could you just help me reconcile those two comments? I guess, and then thinking a little bit more long term, I think the plan previously was for direct-to-consumer to rise in mix and pull the margins of the company up as the margins in the DTC segment rise above wholesale after some pretty heavy investing you guys did to stage that the DTC business for scale. Are those investments in place and do they become leverageable over time or are there elements of the -- in the DTC business that need to keep growing as you do look ahead to getting back to growth of that business? Matthew Friend : Sure, Michael. Well, starting with the spring order books, what I mentioned is that our order books came in, on with our partners at flat versus the prior year. And it was a little light relative to what we expected. What we're seeing in there that we're encouraged by, very excited by, is the fact that we're seeing newness and innovation scaling in the second half. And so, I mentioned that footwear units related to newness and innovation, we define that as products that have been introduced, they are either new or have been introduced within the last eight seasons, are growing mid to high-single digits in the second half and, in particular, in that spring season. Underneath that, where we look with the most optimism and where we've been focused first is running. I talked about the momentum that is building in running. And this is where our team started focusing first more than a year ago. This quarter, men\u2019s and women's running footwear was up and it was the first time we've got positive growth in several quarters. When we look at the order book for spring footwear, men's and women's running footwear is growing double-digits. Our North America Running specialty partners were up double-digits in Q1, and the order books for holiday and for spring are giving us indications that we're going to sustain that momentum. And when you look at the way we're investing behind the brand, the ground game that we're operating, if you visited any running events around the world, I recently ran a half marathon and saw NIKE quite present, but I know they were -- we were very present over the Berlin Marathon and multiple activations around the world. We're focused on being present with runners in their communities in order to truly land the impact of our product portfolio. And then I talked about the pipeline of what's coming. And we're really excited about a number of things that are coming in our product pipeline, including new cushioning innovation, new premium models that are blending Foams and Zoom Air for a new running sensation. We've completely refreshed the lineup of our performance running apparel, which has always been a strength for NIKE, and so we're excited about the product that we're bringing there. The trail models that we've got are continuing to perform well in the marketplace. And we're excited about the growth that we see in the running segment around trail. And then lastly, we've talked about the core opportunity, which we define as below $100. And our teams have been focused leveraging our speed lane to be able to get product to market faster at below $100. And this represents several billion dollars' worth of revenue that we walked away from over the last couple of years. And our partners are very excited about the new product that's coming in this dimension. So Running and Core are the two areas where we're most optimistic that we see momentum building from an innovation and a newness perspective. As far as your question about DTC and the investments that we've made in DTC, we continue to see opportunities to more profitably run our Direct business. We talked about the investments that we were making against expectations for further growth, and we were largely meeting the demand that the consumer was driving towards those channels. We continue to see opportunities to drive efficiencies in the profitability of our Direct business. And that includes a higher mix of full price product in our direct channels, but also leveraging supply chain capabilities against the capacity that we've in effect, built to serve our DTC business. As we\u2019ve talked about for the last couple of quarters, our focus is on driving growth across the entire marketplace, balanced growth across the entire marketplace. And that is where our teams have been focused, and that\u2019s where you\u2019ll continue to see us trying to drive growth and improve profitability across both dimensions of the marketplace. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO. Please go ahead. Simeon Siegel : Thanks. Hey, good afternoon, guys. Matt, any \u2013 thank you for all this. Any color you'd be willing to provide or just order of magnitude on how large each of the core franchises that you are resetting are at this point and just maybe where you'd like to take them? And then just revenues were down double-digits, but the gross margin still grew nicely this quarter. So any context on the margins of those franchises that are being reset versus the rest of the product? Thank you. Matthew Friend : Well, Simeon, what we've been talking about for a couple of quarters is trying to create better balance in our business. And over the last couple of years, one of the things that we've talked about, but especially this last year is that we've -- our portfolio has gotten too concentrated, particularly against these classic -- the classic dimensions. Our teams have tried to bring new dimension to these classics. And as a result of that, we've created an incredibly large amount of consumer demand. But at the same time, the portfolio was largely too concentrated against these styles. Classics footwear is an important dimension of our overall portfolio. Internally at NIKE, we refer to these products as icons. They're incredibly culturally relevant and they will continue to be an important part of our portfolio overall. But this quarter, in particular, we took a big step forward in the reduction of these products, causing them to decline more than it\u2019s overall business so that we could start to shift the portfolio back in order. And we're going to continue to take those steps over the coming quarters. And what I can tell you is that the continued actions results in us expecting to see a headwind similar to what we experienced in the first quarter. In other words, a mid-single digit headwind on revenue for the balance of this year, as a result of more proactively managing these franchises back into a proper place within the overall portfolio. They are long-tenured products. They do drive attractive margins for the company, especially, when we sell them through Digital. And so part of the pressure on margins and the additional color that we provided on the balance of the year is that by driving the dimensionality more particularly in the NIKE Direct channels and particularly in the Digital channels, it does create a transitory headwind on margin as we right-size the portfolio largely focused on the Digital side or the Direct side of the business. But looking forward, like I said, these products will continue to remain an important part of the portfolio. We just are focused on trying to accelerate newness and innovation in order to create more momentum with consumers and more energy with consumers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Lorraine Hutchinson : Thank you. Good afternoon. How would you characterize the receptivity of your wholesale partners to get behind some of the new launches, and how are your partners feeling about the level of inventory in the wholesale channel now and for the spring season? Matthew Friend : Yeah. It's a great question, Lorraine. We've been working, our teams have been closely engaging with our partners since we acknowledged some of the missteps related to over centering on Direct. And I think the momentum that we're building with our partners is very encouraging. I referenced specifically the interactions that we had that I was personally a part of in Paris during the Summer Olympics. But our geography teams, Tom Petty, our partners are leaning in, in order to be able to reignite growth and momentum for NIKE on the wholesale side. And I wouldn't drive past the fact that what's most important in wholesale is, we've got to have a breadth of distribution segmented to create and demonstrate the full dimension of the NIKE portfolio across men's, women's, and kids, across sport dimensions and the Jordan brand. And one of the ways that we do that is, we invest with our partners to elevate and differentiate our brand at retail. That isn't a new playbook for NIKE but it's one that enables us to play to our strengths. And we've got a couple of proof points that we're already working on with partners on the sporting goods side. We're excited about the women's pad and concept, the women's fitness concept that we've been testing with DICK'S in their House of Sport. It's set to be ready to pilot, given the returns that it's driving for both us and for DICK'S. We're excited about bringing new energy to basketball with Foot Locker and you remember the House and Hoops concept, coming forward now with this new Home Court concept. And to be honest with you, maybe I'll take an opportunity to tie this a little bit back to Elliott because this is a similar approach that we took when we ignited growth in North America back in 2010. When we say things like we need to sharpen our focus on sport, it doesn't just mean that we need to sell more performance products. What it means is that we have to create deeper connections with consumers through sport and that's where our relationship starts. And when we create deep connections with consumers through sport, that enables us to extend into sportswear and lifestyle. And one of the things that we did in North America back in 2010 when our business was stagnating from a growth perspective, and Elliott was a new General Manager at that time, was we reprofiled the marketplace around sport to ignite growth in the marketplace. And the net result of that was double-digit growth over the next four years and really set the foundation for NIKE to grow throughout the decades of 2010. And so that is where our focus and our attention has been. Digital is still and Direct is still an important part of our overall marketplace strategy. Having direct connections with consumers is strategically important. But our consumers want to connect directly with NIKE, whether it's in our own channel or with a partner. And so, we\u2019re going to continue to focus to elevate and to raise the marketplace and bring the best of NIKE to the market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Please go ahead. Paul Lejuez : Hey, thanks, guys. You mentioned Running up double-digits in North America, your Running specialty partners. Can you talk about how far that business has fallen from peak to trough? How much do you think you have to regain in that channel within North America? And also, the second quarter gross margin decline that you mentioned, can you just dimensionalize that by region, where your bigger pressure points are? Is it across the board? Where are the larger declines versus smaller declines? Thanks. Matthew Friend : Well, on your first question, Paul, what I would say is that we've acknowledged that we've lost market share in the Running specialty channel. More than four years ago, we pulled back on our engagement with that channel. And as a result of that, we saw market share losses. But what I would also say is that the importance of investing and connecting in the Running specialty channel extends way beyond the business impact of driving revenue there. It's about the community of running. It's about connecting directly with runners. And while we've seen tremendous success at the top of the pyramid with innovation with marathons and on the track, we haven't made as much progress with everyday runners. And that's where our team's focus and attention has been over the last year. And what I can tell you is that some of the statistics that I highlighted are there as indicators for us and for you to see the momentum that's building for us in that dimension of the business. And it is incredibly important to NIKE. NIKE's a running company. NIKE is a running brand, and it's incredibly important for NIKE to win with runners. And so our commitment to reinvesting in those channels with those partners on the ground every day is how we're going to change the trajectory of this business. And the proof points and the indicators that I provided are our early signals of confidence that this momentum is building. And then the pipeline of product that we've got coming behind it, we're incredibly excited about. And you'll see it extend from Running specialty into sporting goods. You'll see some of these innovations cross the line into lifestyle based on the ways that we bring the product to market. And so we're deeply encouraged by that momentum that's coming and running. As it relates to the second quarter margin question, I guess what I would tell you is this. There are a number of puts and takes between Q1 and Q2 on margin. And the higher promotions that we referenced, some of the channel mix headwinds, the supply chain deleverage, as well as the actions to manage the marketplace, they're largely across the portfolio. There's not -- it's -- I wouldn't point out one particular geography more so than the other in terms of where a particular challenge lies. We are seeing a lessening benefit from product costs in Q2 and from strategic pricing actions in the prior year, which we still saw in Q1 of this year. And so that's also playing an impact on the year-over-year comparisons. And then I guess what I would also highlight is, we're watching the East Coast port strike really closely. We haven't baked anything in for a timeline on the East Coast port strike, but that's a possibility of a risk related to what we're talking about right now. Operator : We have time for one more question, and that question comes from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brooke Roach : Good afternoon, and thank you for taking our question. I was hoping we could dig in a little bit more on the China business, and what you're seeing between the read on the macro and what's specific to NIKE. How should we be thinking about your inventory levels by channel in China and what types of engagement are you seeing on some of your franchise product versus your new innovation with the Chinese consumer today? Thank you. Matthew Friend : Well, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our traffic was soft across all channels in the quarter. And when we look at the performance in our business, we look at our industry and we look across industry, from what we can see, NIKE is not immune to the challenges with the consumer in Greater China today. The marketplace has been promotional, and we've actually been seeing improvements in full price realization over the past few seasons as we've managed our inventory very, very carefully. But this quarter, we did -- we were more aggressive in promotional activity, given the traffic trends and given what we were more broadly seeing across the industry. I think that you can probably most notably see where we're focused on inventory on the wholesale side, where our revenue was up 10% in Q1. This was partly impacted by shipping timing, but retail sales grew in the quarter but they didn't grow at that rate. And so we're focused on proactively managing forward-looking order books with our partners, but also margin assistance in order to move through excess inventory so that we can ensure that we stay healthy and that our partners are getting behind the newness and the innovation that\u2019s coming in the second half of the year. In the first quarter, our top innovations for performance stories actually resonated quite well. Peg 41, Pegasus 41 performed really strongly. Alphafly 3 and Running is growing in China. Sabrina 2, KD resonated with consumers, and I mentioned Kobe. Kobe\u2019s a beloved athlete in China, and it was one of the biggest opportunities we saw to bring Kobe back into the product family, and we\u2019re incredibly excited about the energy that\u2019s building in China for Kobe. And so we believe that when we create distinction in the marketplace, whether it\u2019s against our global competitors or local competitors when we bring our best stories and our best products to the marketplace. And I think we continue to see that. As it relates to the largest, the classics franchises, there was definitely strong demand for the classic franchises in China. Jordan is a big business in Greater China, and we\u2019re watching and managing that business carefully. But our focus and attention is really on performance and innovation. And you heard me say before that innovation has the highest mix of business in China relative to some of our other geographies. Now as we look long term, even though we\u2019ve moderated our near-term expectations for China for the remainder of this year, sport is a growth industry in China. Sport participation is on the rise, and we believe that we\u2019re optimistic about the long-term possibilities for NIKE in Greater China. We\u2019re going to keep playing our strengths around innovation and newness. We think that the investments that we have in the marketplace from a retail point of view and the way that we present our products to consumers through our partner stores gives us an opportunity to present our brand in a way that we can\u2019t do anywhere else in the world. And we\u2019re focused on capabilities that we\u2019ve been building, specifically China for China, around product, around our Digital platforms and supply chain in order to be able to continue to serve the local consumer at the speed that, that marketplace is moving. So we\u2019re optimistic about the long-term opportunity for NIKE in China and the long-term opportunity for sport in China. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",
